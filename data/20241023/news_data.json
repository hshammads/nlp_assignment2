        "first_p": "Monday, October 21, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) and Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), as well as a micro-cap stock Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (HOV).\u00a0 The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nShares of Visa have gained +10.9% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry\u2019s gain of +16.1%. The company\u2019s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving its revenues. Visa, fueled by persistent increases in payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing significant profit growth.\n\nThe ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value. However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges.\n\nThe Zacks analyst expect adjusted operating expenses to jump more than 10% in fiscal 2024. It is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. Consumer spending growth is also drying up. Moreover, rising client incentives will affect its adjusted revenues. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\nNetflix\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the year-to-date period (+74.1% vs. +32.8%). The company\u2019s third-quarter 2024 results benefited from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention.\n\nThe planned launch of an in-house ad tech platform in 2025 signals Netflix's commitment to maximizing this new revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year in 2025. Netflix has raised its guidance for the full year 2024, projecting revenue growth at the high end of its previous 14-15% range.\n\nHowever, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ is a headwind. NFLX\u2019s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\n\nShares of Merck have gained +0.1% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry\u2019s gain of +22.7%. The company\u2019s products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers.\n\nMerck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda. However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line.\n\nThere are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity later in the decade. Estimates have declined slightly ahead of Q3 results. Merck has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\n\nHovnanian\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry over the past year (+175.6% vs. +89.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $1.25 billion has shown strong financial performance in fiscal third-quarter 2024, with an 11% revenue increase to $722.7 million, driven by higher home deliveries and sales prices.\n\nThe company saw a 38% rise in income before taxes and a 30.8% rise in net income, supported by improved EBITDA of $127.9 million. Key growth drivers include a 24% increase in community count and a 34% rise in lots controlled, setting the stage for future revenue gains. Favorable mortgage rate declines and strong buyer demand, evidenced by a 23% increase in contracts and surging web traffic, support the company\u2019s outlook.\n\nHovnanian\u2019s strategic focus on high-margin markets and diversified geographic and product mix enhances its resilience and profitability. With upward revisions to 2024 revenue and EBITDA guidance, HOV remains well-poised for continued growth in a strong housing market.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Hovnanian here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Blackstone Inc. (BX) and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW).\n\nMark Vickery\nSenior Editor\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

This exceptional growth in profitability underscores Netflix's ability to efficiently monetize its vast content library and growing subscriber base. Revenues also impressed, reaching $9.82 billion, marking a robust 15% year-over-year increase and beating the consensus mark by 0.6%.\n\nInvestors have responded enthusiastically to Netflix's performance, with NFLX shares returning an impressive 56.9% year to date, significantly outperforming tech giants like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.",

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings indicates a substantial year-over-year decline of 12.1% and revenue growth of 9.5%. The earnings track record of the company is not good as it delivered a four-quarter average negative earnings surprise of 7.99%. The electric carmaker is down 5.7% in the last three months (read: Should You Buy Tesla ETFs Ahead of Q3 Earnings?).\n\nTesla returned to delivery growth in the third quarter after two consecutive quarters of decline and reported the third-largest quarterly number in the company's history. Investors are keenly waiting for specifics on the company's plans for an affordable EV below $30,000 and its long-term Cybercab vision after the recent Robotaxi event, which left investors disappointed due to the lack of concrete details regarding its ridesharing platform.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.57% and Zacks Rank #2. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 9.60%. Earnings are expected to increase 18.1%, while revenues are expected to grow 13.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has plunged 9% in the last three months.\n\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +2.83% and Zacks Rank #2. The social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 2 cents for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 17.8%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.6% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 12.61%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 23.5% over the past three months.\n\nMeta Platform is trading near an all-time high and several analysts raised the target price for META ahead of its earnings, showing strong confidence in the company\u2019s growth. UBS raised the price target to $690 from $635, maintaining a Buy rating, while Guggenheim raised Meta's price target to $665 from $600 with a Buy rating. Jefferies and TD Cowen lifted the price target on Meta Platforms to $675 from $600 each and kept a Buy rating. KeyBanc increased the price target to $655 from the previous $560 while maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock.\n\nAnalysts cited enhanced user engagement and better monetization of video content, including the Reels feature on the platform. An increased ad load and overall usage rate for its Reels (short-form-video) offering would \"continue to drive growth\" for Instagram.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -0.74% and a Zacks Rank #3. Microsoft saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the four-quarter earnings surprise being 6.34%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 3% and revenue growth of 14% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has shed about 4% over the past three months.\n\nThe world's largest software company is spending billions to construct new data centers to meet demand for cloud computing and power-hungry AI services. While Azure growth will continue to slow in the current quarter, chief financial officer Amy Hood said that investments in data centers and servers will let the company capitalize on demand and accelerate Azure growth in the second half of fiscal 2025. Microsoft expects revenues of $63.8-$64.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, implying 13.8% growth at the middle of the range.\n\nApple\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -17.71% and a Zacks Rank #3. Apple saw a negative earnings estimate revision of 6 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal fourth quarter. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 3.79% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 5.5% for earnings and 5.6% for revenues. The stock is up 4.9% over the past three months.\n\nThe iPhone manufacturer returned to revenue growth in fiscal third-quarter 2024 and introduced four versions of iPhone 16 based on AI last month. The new AI-based iPhones will likely kickstart the next big upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple. The stock touched a new high this week on improving demand for its latest iPhone 16. The preliminary iPhone shipment data posted by International Data Corporation showed strong demand for Apple's previous smartphone models. Sales were also helped by Apple's rollout of iPhone 16 (read: ETFs to Tap Apple's Potential AI-Based Growth).\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 34.1% and substantial revenue growth of 9.8% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 31.1%. The stock has gained about 1.8% in the past three months.\n\nAmazon remains the king of e-commerce, and its advertising unit is booming. The growth in Amazon\u2019s cloud computing business \u2014 Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) \u2014 is also accelerating, driven by its AI capabilities. Like other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $154-$158.5 billion for the third quarter of 2024.",

The electric carmaker is down 5.7% in the last three months (read: Should You Buy Tesla ETFs Ahead of Q3 Earnings?).\n\nTesla returned to delivery growth in the third quarter after two consecutive quarters of decline and reported the third-largest quarterly number in the company's history. Investors are keenly waiting for specifics on the company's plans for an affordable EV below $30,000 and its long-term Cybercab vision after the recent Robotaxi event, which left investors disappointed due to the lack of concrete details regarding its ridesharing platform.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.57% and Zacks Rank #2. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 9.60%.

The Internet behemoth has plunged 9% in the last three months.\n\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space.

The social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 2 cents for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days.

Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 12.61%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 23.5% over the past three months.\n\nMeta Platform is trading near an all-time high and several analysts raised the target price for META ahead of its earnings, showing strong confidence in the company\u2019s growth. UBS raised the price target to $690 from $635, maintaining a Buy rating, while Guggenheim raised Meta's price target to $665 from $600 with a Buy rating.

KeyBanc increased the price target to $655 from the previous $560 while maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock.\n\nAnalysts cited enhanced user engagement and better monetization of video content, including the Reels feature on the platform.

Microsoft saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter.

While Azure growth will continue to slow in the current quarter, chief financial officer Amy Hood said that investments in data centers and servers will let the company capitalize on demand and accelerate Azure growth in the second half of fiscal 2025. Microsoft expects revenues of $63.8-$64.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, implying 13.8% growth at the middle of the range.\n\nApple\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -17.71% and a Zacks Rank #3. Apple saw a negative earnings estimate revision of 6 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal fourth quarter. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises.

The stock is up 4.9% over the past three months.\n\nThe iPhone manufacturer returned to revenue growth in fiscal third-quarter 2024 and introduced four versions of iPhone 16 based on AI last month.

The stock touched a new high this week on improving demand for its latest iPhone 16. The preliminary iPhone shipment data posted by International Data Corporation showed strong demand for Apple's previous smartphone models.

Like other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.

        "first_p": "Tuesday, October 22, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), as well as a micro-cap stocks Comstock Holding Companies, Inc. (CHCI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+190.3% vs. +135.4%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nThe Zacks analyst expect NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 46.4% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nShares of Microsoft have gained +11.9% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Software industry\u2019s gain of +13.3%. The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\n\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth. The Zacks analyst expect fiscal 2025 net sales to grow 12.8% from fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\n\nBroadcom\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the year-to-date period (+63.0% vs. +44.3%). The company is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. Its expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy.\n\nAVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\n\nShares of Comstock have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry over the year-to-date period (+143.9% vs. +26.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $106.61 million recorded strong revenue growth of 11% year over year, reaching $21.4 million in the first half of 2024.\n\nThis growth is driven by high demand for its premium, transit-oriented properties like The Hartford and Reston Metro Plaza, with fully leased spaces attracting high-profile tenants such as Google, Rolls-Royce, and GuidePoint Security. The company\u2019s focus on urban, commuter-friendly developments positions it well to capture long-term growth in the Washington D.C. market.\n\nComstock's asset-light, debt-free model, combined with access to a $10 million credit facility, provides ample financial flexibility for future developments. Its diversified tenant base and strong occupancy rates reduce vacancy risk. However, the company faces concentration risk with heavy reliance on key developments. A structural shift toward remote work also poses challenges to its office leasing performance.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Comstock here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Roche Holding AG (RHHBY), American Express Co. (AXP) and The Progressive Corp. (PGR).\n\nMark Vickery\nSenior Editor\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.
