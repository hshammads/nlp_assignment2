The split leaves the platforms potentially on the hook for damages in more than 150 cases before Rogers even as they\u2019re poised to dodge liability for claims in more than 600 other cases filed in Los Angeles.\nRogers generally denied a request for dismissal of negligence claims, but narrowed the scope of allegations that will proceed. She concluded that some claims are barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a longstanding federal law shielding internet companies from lawsuits.\nGoogle and Meta spokespersons denied wrongdoing, saying their companies have taken steps to keep young users safe on the platforms. Snap also cited its safety initiatives and pointed to research showing that its Snapchat has a positive impact on the well-being of users. TikTok didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe ruling comes just over a week after Rogers ruled that Meta must face a lawsuit by dozens of state attorneys general alleging it knowingly hooked kids on its Facebook and Instagram platforms. TikTok faces similar claims by a coalition of states. Both companies have denied wrongdoing.\nThe companies also face significant exposure from hundreds of personal injury suits accusing them of designing their platforms to encourage youths to spend unhealthy amounts of time on screens. But the school cases may carry bigger potential monetary damages because each district seeks to recoup institutional costs from the negative repercussions of having hundreds of individual students hooked on social media.\nThe school districts alleged that the companies engineered their platforms to addict kids by using algorithms and features such as the \u201clike\u201d button, in ways that hurt society \u2014 akin to cigarette manufacturers that designed their products to be addictive.\n\u2018Compulsive Use\u2019\nRogers said the schools\u2019 core legal theory was viable: the social media companies \u201cdeliberately fostered compulsive use of their platforms which foreseeably caused\u201d the school districts to spend resources on combating the mental health crisis among students.\nStory Continues\nGoogle spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in a statement that the allegations aren\u2019t true.\n\u201cIn collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls,\u201d Castaneda said.\nA Meta spokesperson said in a statement that the company disagrees with the court\u2019s decision.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed numerous tools to support parents and teens, and we recently announced that we\u2019re significantly changing the Instagram experience for tens of millions of teens with new Teen Accounts, a protected experience for teens that automatically limits who can contact them and the content they see,\u201d according to the statement.\nLexi Hazam and Previn Warren, lead lawyers for the plaintiffs, hailed the ruling as a victory \u201cfor schools, teachers, and administrators who are on the front lines of the nation\u2019s youth mental health crisis.\u201d\n\u201cBecause of the addictive design of Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube, students are struggling,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cThat means schools are struggling \u2014 their budgets are stretched and their educational missions are diverted as they shoulder the added responsibility of supporting kids in crisis.\u201d\nPublic Nuisance\nThe judge said claims by school districts based on legal theory of public nuisance \u2014 successfully employed against nicotine vape pen sellers \u2014 will be addressed separately.\nUniversity of Florida law professor Clay Calvert said the big payouts in the Juul litigation might have prompted plaintiffs lawyers to pursue similar theories in the social media cases.\n\u201cI think they see there\u2019s potential out there from large settlements,\u201d he said.\nBut the professor also there are fundamental differences between vape pens and social media, including First Amendment protections for the content posted on social media.\nThe Los Angeles and Oakland judges are overseeing separate batches of personal injury suits by youths and families alleging that the social media companies are responsible for causing widespread psychological distress and even suicides.\nThe federal case is In Re Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, 22-md-03047, US District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).\n(Updates with comments by Meta, Google and Snap starting in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

META\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 29.42 and 23.87 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA close up of a user's hand scrolling through a mobile social media application.\nMeta's Q2 2024 earnings report indicates that we are not in an AI bubble, with the company's stock soared 415% since Nov 22. Meta's current business model revolves around enhancing engagement across its Family of Apps, demonstrating the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in driving user interaction. A notable shift occurred with an 8-10% increase in Reels watch time after Meta implemented a unified AI recommendation model for all video players, a move that showcases AI's role in boosting incremental engagement across the platform.\nMeta's strategic investments in data center infrastructure over the past five years allow the company to capitalize on high-return opportunities, proving its ability to innovate and adapt quickly to market demands. Meta is also distinguishing between core AI and generative AI, noting that while the latter may not deliver immediate returns, investments in core AI are already yielding strong results. CFO Susan Li emphasized that ongoing investments in core AI enhance content recommendation and advertising relevance, ensuring that Meta can direct its resources flexibly across various AI initiatives as opportunities arise.\nConcerns about Meta's decision to open-source the Llama model stem from misunderstandings about value creation in networked environments. The true value lies not in the models themselves, but in their application within Meta's expansive user base. Furthermore, the Threads platform has surpassed 200 million monthly active users, positioning Meta to leverage economies of scale before monetizing the service fully.\nDespite initial skepticism about its metaverse ambitions, Meta is proving to be a formidable player in AI-driven technologies. The Reality Labs segment, which includes revenue from Quest headset sales, has also shown a 28% year-over-year increase, signaling growth potential that could contribute to a new computing platform. Meta's ability to iterate quickly and focus on customer needs has been critical to its success. As Zuckerberg noted, the company is committed to learning faster than competitors, positioning it to thrive in a dynamic market landscape.\nStory Continues\nMeta's bullish outlook is fueled by its strategic focus on AI and infrastructure, which positions the company for significant growth.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\n20 Countries with the Most Social Media Users\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nMeta Platforms\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its Q2 results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it\u2019s doing would bear more results in the future.\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe are pleased to report that\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\nOverall, META ranks 2nd on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The Company has been a consistent beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past several years, investing aggressively behind deep learning recommendation systems that help power products that reach nearly half the population of the planet. Meta's AI investments, combined with its massive scale, allow the Company to quickly spin up new products across its digital advertising real estate to reinforce its competitive positioning. Meta's core Family of Apps products are backed by extremely large and complex (i.e. difficult to copy) AI recommendation systems that have to sort through billions of datapoints in real time and come up with the probability of a user engaged to click.

In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\nThe 5 social networking stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2.2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 0.9% above.\nInflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal recently, leading the Fed to reduce its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent or 0.5%) in September 2024. This is the first cut in four years. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be debating whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\nWhile some social networking stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 4% since the latest earnings results.\nMeta (NASDAQ:META)\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Reality Labs.\nMeta reported revenues of $39.07 billion, up 22.1% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 2%. Overall, it was an impressive quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates and strong sales guidance for the next quarter.\n\"We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO.\nMeta Total Revenue\nMeta scored the fastest revenue growth of the whole group. The company reported 3.27 billion daily active users, up 6.5% year on year. Unsurprisingly, the stock is up 19.6% since reporting and currently trades at $567.41.\nWe think Meta is a good business, but is it a buy today? Read our full report here, it\u2019s free.\nBest Q2: Nextdoor (NYSE:KIND)\nHelping residents figure out what's happening on their block in real time, Nextdoor (NYSE:KIND) is a social network that connects neighbors with each other and with local businesses.\nStory Continues\nNextdoor reported revenues of $63.29 million, up 11.3% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 8.5%. The business had a very strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates and optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter.\nNextdoor Total Revenue\nNextdoor delivered the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers.

          "whole_article": "We recently looked at Goldman Sachs\u2019 List Of Stocks That Hedge & Mutual Funds Love & Hate: 28 Stocks On The Mutual and Hedge Funds Radar. In this piece, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) sits on the fund managers' radar.\nThe surge in interest surrounding artificial intelligence has meant that the stock market in 2024 has continued to surprise. Just like most Wall Street analysts were left scratching their heads after worries of a recession proved to be unfounded, this year, analysts have continued to revise their year end targets of the flagship S&P index multiple times. Take the example of investment bank Goldman Sachs. Its latest index year end target was released in October, and as of now, the bank believes that the index will close at 6,000 points by the end of this year.\nBefore the October target, the bank had upped its year end estimate to 5,600 points in June. This was based on optimism for big tech stocks and the rush surrounding AI that continued to fuel them. This had added 400 points to the previous target of 5,200 points which was released in February, and this in turn had added 100 points to the previous upward revision of 5,100 over the first Goldman Sachs S&P year end target of 4,700 points.\nSafe to say, the market has beaten expectations in 2024. Its recent value of 5,832 points leaves it just 2.8% shy of Goldman\u2019s latest 2024 estimate. The index is up by 23.6% year to date, and to see just how much its returns have been driven by artificial intelligence, consider the fact that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange\u2019s semiconductor stock index is up 27.8% year to date. AI, and particularly semiconductor stocks, continue to make their mark and the key question now is whether this performance will be sustained after the third quarter earnings season.\nThe Q2 season was nothing short of fireworks for some of the biggest AI names. Two firms in particular come to mind when we reminisce. The first is Wall Street\u2019s AI darling which is known for making the best AI GPUs in the world, and the second is the firm behind Windows OS that has invested billions of dollars in the AI upstart OpenAI.\u00a0 Both these stocks did well in the first half of 2024 but pared back some of their gains in H2. Starting from the GPU company, its stock is up 186% year to date. However, from the peak in June which had marked 181% in YTD gains back then, the shares are up by a modest 1.84%. For the software company, the shares peaked at 26% year to date returns before the Q2 earnings season, and since the peak, they are down 10.4%.\nStory Continues\nThe difference in their share price appreciation isn\u2019t surprising even though it might appear to be so. Simply put, the reason the GPU maker has posted stronger returns is its products are the immediate need of the AI industry. On the other hand, the software company\u2019s products are part of a later wave of AI which counts upon strong demand for AI products within the business world to enable it to turn a profit. Turning a profit is key since it has already invested billions of dollars into OpenAI. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the minutiae of AI investing, do check out Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks.\nShifting gears, within this dynamic stock market environment, mutual funds appear to be performing well. Research from BofA covering their performance for the first quarter shows that 64% of actively managed large cap US mutual funds beat their benchmarks. This was a sizeable jump over 38% of funds beating the benchmarks last year, with the bank speculating that a broadening of equities performance was part of the reason driving the returns. A study from The Wall Street Journal adds to this. It looks at the performance of large cap growth funds during H1 2024 and shares that the Magnificent 7 stocks drove large cap growth funds to the top of the mutual fund pyramid. The survey looked at 1,218 funds to determine that just 15% were in the red, with the average 12 month return of all the surveyed funds being 16.5%.\nWhile on one end of the spectrum are the risk averse mutual funds, on the other, are hedge funds that chase alpha through leverage. This risk means that the funds can accumulate large losses that take years to recover from. This is the case for some of the funds, according to Goldman\u2019s latest industry report. It shows that Tiger Global, Whale Rock, and Third Point which fell 50%+, 45%, and 21.8% in 2022 still haven\u2019t recovered. In 2023, the three respective funds posted 28.5%, 18%, and 4.1%, while their performance through July was 10.7% and 10.9% for Tiger Global and Third Point and 18.9% through May for Whale Rock.\nIn fact, GS\u2019 data shows that roughly one third of long-short funds are yet to recover their 2022 losses, as they are joined by 31% of event driven funds and 45% of macro driven funds. However, some of the top performing funds in the first half were Bridgewater Associates and Citadel, which posted 14.1% and 13.7% in returns respectively. The top performer among hedge funds appears to be AQR Capital with its long/short fund delivering 16.3% in returns.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that hedge funds and mutual funds love and hate, we divided Goldman\u2019s Hedge Fund Trend Monitor and Mutual Fundamentals report into four categories. These categories are stocks that both avoid, stocks that both love, and stocks favored by one but avoided by the other. Stocks within these categories were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. To learn more about the number of top hedge fund investments in some of these stocks, you can check out Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA person looking intently at a broker's screen full of stock information, implying the company's stock market expertise.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 219\nCategory: Most popular with HFs and underweight among mutual funds\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is another mega cap technology giant. The firm is among a handful of companies in the world that have access to foundational AI models and sufficient cash resources to fund development. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) had $32 billion in cash and equivalents as of its latest quarter. The firm enjoyed a 3.2 billion user base as of March, and this means that its primary line of revenue comes from advertisers. Subsequently, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is benefiting from its ability to push AI features to advertisers. The firm is enabling advertisers to rely on AI for customer support and marketing. Additionally, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s sizeable user base also creates the potential to provide consumers with AI features. Some features that the firm offers are photo editing, imaging editing, and others. Consequently, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has one of the broadest AI platforms in the industry.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMeta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 11th on our list of stocks that fund managers love and hate according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

You can name one or more people, and they don't need an Apple ID or device.\nYou'll have to share an access key with your contact. It can be a digital version sent electronically, or you can print a copy or save it as a screenshot or PDF.\nTake note that there are some types of files you won't be able to pass on \u2014 including digital rights-protected music, movies and passwords stored in Apple's password manager. Legacy contacts can only access a deceased user's account for three years before Apple deletes the account.\nGoogle\nGoogle takes a different approach with its Inactive Account Manager, which allows you to share your data with someone if it notices that you've stopped using your account.\nWhen setting it up, you need to decide how long Google should wait \u2014 from three to 18 months \u2014 before considering your account inactive. Once that time is up, Google can notify up to 10 people.\nYou can write a message informing them you\u2019ve stopped using the account, and, optionally, include a link to download your data. You can choose what types of data they can access \u2014 including emails, photos, calendar entries and YouTube videos.\nThere's also an option to automatically delete your account after three months of inactivity, so your contacts will have to download any data before that deadline.\nFacebook and Instagram\nSome social media platforms can preserve accounts for people who have died so that friends and family can honor their memories.\nWhen users of Facebook or Instagram die, parent company Meta says it can memorialize the account if it gets a \u201cvalid request\u201d from a friend or family member. Requests can be submitted through an online form.\nStory Continues\nThe social media company strongly recommends Facebook users add a legacy contact to look after their memorial accounts. Legacy contacts can do things like respond to new friend requests and update pinned posts, but they can\u2019t read private messages or remove or alter previous posts. You can only choose one person, who also has to have a Facebook account.\nYou can also ask Facebook or Instagram to delete a deceased user\u2019s account if you\u2019re a close family member or an executor. You\u2019\nTikTok\nThe video-sharing platform says that if a user has died, people can submit a request to memorialize the account through the settings menu. Go to the Report a Problem section, then Account and profile, then Manage account, where you can report a deceased user.\nOnce an account has been memorialized, it will be labeled \u201cRemembering.\u201d No one will be able to log into the account, which prevents anyone from editing the profile or using the account to post new content or send messages.\nX\nIt's not possible to nominate a legacy contact on Elon Musk's social media site. But family members or an authorized person can submit a request to deactivate a deceased user's account.\nPasswords\nBesides the major online services, you'll probably have dozens if not hundreds of other digital accounts that your survivors might need to access. You could just write all your login credentials down in a notebook and put it somewhere safe. But making a physical copy presents its own vulnerabilities. What if you lose track of it? What if someone finds it?\nInstead, consider a password manager that has an emergency access feature. Password managers are digital vaults that you can use to store all your credentials. Some, like Keeper,Bitwarden and NordPass, allow users to nominate one or more trusted contacts who can access their keys in case of an emergency such as a death.\nBut there are a few catches: Those contacts also need to use the same password manager and you might have to pay for the service.\n___\nIs there a tech challenge you need help figuring out?

However, I\u2019m more cautious this time. While I remain a long-term Apple bull, analysts have raised their estimates for FQ4 over the past three months, adding pressure on the company to meet these heightened expectations. As a result, I\u2019m uncertain if now is the best time to buy, despite my long-term optimism.\nIn addition to this, the stock\u2019s stretched valuation after its recent rally could further increase the pressure for strong performance, leaving little room for any slip-ups in guidance. The narrative surrounding the AI supercycle, still in its early stages, also adds a layer of short-term volatility.\nRecap of Apple\u2019s Latest Earnings\nAlthough I have a more cautious outlook on Apple stock ahead of its FQ4 earnings, the previous quarter was quite strong, with the company exceeding expectations on both earnings and revenue. Apple reported an EPS of $1.40, beating the consensus estimate of $1.34, and posted revenues of $85.8 billion, surpassing the $84.4 billion forecast. This marked the sixth consecutive quarter that the firm exceeded earnings estimates, highlighting Apple\u2019s consistent performance\nTwo key takeaways from the quarter were Apple\u2019s performance in China and its approach to capital expenditures (CapEx). First, despite a 6.5% year-over-year decline in China sales, the results were better than expected, especially given that the iPhone dropped out of the top five in market share, slipping to 14% from 16% a year ago.\nSecond, while many Big Tech companies have been significantly increasing their AI-related spending, Apple has taken a more conservative approach. The company is likely to maintain its CapEx in the $10\u2013$11 billion range annually. In fact, over the past twelve months, CapEx has decreased by 28% compared to the same period last year\u2014far below the $50\u2013$70 billion being spent by some of its peers.\nApple\u2019s Conservative Approach Has Resonated Well with the Market\nApple\u2019s conservative approach has resonated well with the market. Unlike its peers, Apple\u2019s AI strategy focuses on improving existing products to better monetize its vast user base rather than building data centers. This cautious spending led to strong cash flow, with $29 billion in operating cash flow in the June quarter\u2014a record. With $153 billion in cash and $101 billion in debt, Apple is well-positioned to reward shareholders, returning over $32.7 billion last quarter through share buybacks and a $0.25 dividend.\nStory Continues\nThe Services segment also deserves special attention, as it has clearly been the company\u2019s main growth driver over the past three months. The segment generated $24 billion in revenue, a 14% increase year-over-year. This growth is particularly significant when considering the margins: Services had a 74% gross margin compared to 35.3% for products. As Apple\u2019s hardware base expands, Services revenue continues to hit new highs, boosting overall profitability.\nWhat to Anticipate for Apple\u2019s Fiscal Q4\nDespite the strong momentum in AAPL shares, I remain neutral ahead of Apple\u2019s October 31 earnings report. Part of my concern lies in the optimism among analysts, with 21 out of 26 raising EPS estimates and 20 out of 25 boosting revenue projections over the past three months.\nTo beat expectations, Apple must surpass an EPS of $1.59\u2014indicating 6% year-over-year growth\u2014and report revenues above $94.33 billion, a 5% increase. However, analysts expect the following quarters to see even more growth, which adds pressure on the company to deliver results.\nConsidering short-term stock movements, while the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, both capable of running artificial intelligence (AI), should be the company\u2019s next growth drivers, so far, sales have been lackluster. Initial sales of 37 million units fell 12.7% below the iPhone 15\u2019s launch figures. However, a recent report showed that iPhone sales in China have surged 20% in the first three weeks, offering a more positive outlook.\niPhone 16 Potential May Not Be Realized Yet\nI believe, however, that it may still be too early to make any deeper analysis, considering that the full potential of the iPhone 16 may not be realized until more AI features become available, delaying any AI-driven super cycle.\nBeyond the iPhone, I see performance in the China region as quite important. In the last nine months, Apple has seen sales in China fall by 9.6%, reflecting the ongoing struggles in the region, where it is rapidly losing market share to local competitors. Although the trend is that the iPhone 16 demand should pick up again, there likely won\u2019t be any major breakthroughs in the fourth quarter.\nHigh Valuation Could Pressure Apple Stock\nThe primary reason for market skepticism about Apple today is, arguably, its valuation. While this premium is supported by the company\u2019s high-quality business, Apple remains heavily reliant on the iPhone, which made up over 50% of total revenue last year. On the other hand, the highly profitable Services segment, benefiting from an installed base of 2.2 billion devices, now accounts for nearly one-third of Apple\u2019s revenue (28% in FQ3). This segment boasts strong margins and has been essential in sustaining the valuation premium.\nThat said, analysts expect Apple\u2019s Fiscal 2024 EPS to grow by only 9% year-over-year, with growth rates not exceeding 12% through Fiscal 2026. Consequently, Apple trades at a forward P/E ratio of 35x, significantly higher than its five-year average of around 24x. Even when adjusting for growth\u2014with a projected CAGR of 9.4% over the next three to five years\u2014the resulting PEG ratio of 3.7x is nearly 50% above its historical average and almost three times higher than Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA), making this multiple increasingly difficult to justify.\nWhile long-term investors may not be overly concerned, given Apple\u2019s exceptional cash generation and strong returns on capital, this valuation could contribute to short-term volatility, particularly as the market focuses on near-term results in a rapidly evolving AI-driven environment.\nIs AAPL A Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\nAt TipRanks, the Wall Street consensus on AAPL is a Moderate Buy, consisting of 23 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell. The average price target is\u00a0$248.34, implying a 8.16%\u00a0upside potential ahead.\nSee more AAPL analyst ratings\nKey Takeaway\nI have a Hold rating on Apple ahead of its upcoming earnings, reflecting a cautious outlook due to Wall Street\u2019s high confidence in beating estimates during what is expected to be a low-growth quarter. The impact of the AI supercycle is likely to become clearer in Fiscal 2025.\nAdditionally, keep an eye on stronger-than-expected numbers from China, as they could be pivotal for the region. That said, stretched valuations add an extra layer of caution, leaving little room for setbacks.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\u201cWe Are Just at the Beginning of the AI Buildout\u201d\nEach of the big tech stocks has revealed its plans to invest $50 to $100 billion in GPU compute, evidence that Artificial intelligence may be the biggest theme right now. On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best FAANG Stock To Buy According to Analysts?\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nAnalyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 6.3%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. The company behind the iPhone also sells a range of digital and entertainment products including iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system by Apple backed by AI. The new system is integrated into all new products by Apple. On October 21, Samik Chatterjee, an analyst at JPMorgan, joined CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d where he discussed the demand for iPhone 16 and the influence Apple Intelligence will have on it.\u00a0He argued that Apple Intelligence will likely drive the demand for iPhone 16. Momentum did not build up early this year due to a delay in Apple Intelligence, but now we are looking at a recovery.\nChatterjee adds that AAPL and its consumers are waiting for the new Apple Intelligence features to launch, which will lead to a surge in demand for the iPhone 16 and an even greater surge will be seen for the iPhone 17 launching next year. With or without AI, its proprietary products, especially the iPhone, reported robust earnings. In the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the iPhone generated revenue worth $39.3 billion during FQ3 2024, making up for nearly 45% of the total revenue.\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has grown its revenue and net income by 8% and 10% respectively, over the past 10 years. AAPL holds a legacy with a loyal customer base. The company has had a decent growth trajectory over the years and the integration of AI will only accelerate it further.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple\u2019s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn\u2019t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\"\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.5%.\nRevenues are expected to be $94.43 billion, up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nStory Continues\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?\nFor Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -17.71%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Apple will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $1.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.40, delivering a surprise of +4.48%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nApple doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nFinally, something to cheer for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) bulls. A latest report showed iPhone 16 sales in China increased by 20% year-over-year during the first three weeks of launch, indicating that a \u201crenaissance of growth has begun\u201d for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), according to Wedbush Securities.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe note that both iPhone 16 and Huawei\u2019s new model went on sale September 20th in this key region,\u201d analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThe strength from Apple in particular is coming from the higher end Pro and Pro Max as models are up an eye-popping 44% from a year ago iPhone 15 sales. This industry analysis is consistent with our recent Asia trip and supply chain checks that we believe China sales for iPhone 16 will show a strong rebound over the next year with the beginning of this AI driven super cycle led by iPhone 16.\u201d\nIves kept his Outperform rating and $300 price target for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). He added that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is expected to collaborate with Baidu (BIDU) for AI initiatives in China, much like its partnership with OpenAI in the U.S. This could further boost iPhone upgrades in the region, he suggested.\n\u201cApple launching AI coupled by a massive pent-up upgrade cycle is creating this new era of iPhone growth including in the key China region which has been a drag on the top-line over the past year. We believe there are 100 million Chinese iPhones in the window of an upgrade opportunity alone for 2025.\u201d\nIves also said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0might sell over 240 million iPhones \u201cas this AI-driven upgrade cycle takes hold.\u201d\nHowever, buying Apple just on iPhone 16 hopes could be risky.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features. But the latest numbers for iPhone 16 do not show much enthusiasm for the new device.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cYou probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire\u2019s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett\u2019s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire\u2019s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\u201d\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In nine years he accrued over \u00a3500,000 in sales. His best period came when he sold \u00a360,000 worth of Nintendo consoles in a fortnight.\n\u201cFor someone sitting in student accommodation, it helped to pay my way through university,\u201d he says of his venture.\nWhen he finished his studies, Shabbir closed his business down for mental health reasons and worked in a newsagents on 4am shifts, part-time at Uber Eats (UBER) and Amazon Flex (AMZN) app as a delivery driver while trying to land a job.

On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\nAnalyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 15.9%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks third on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. The technology company is an e-commerce giant that also provides streaming and data cloud services.\nAmazon.com\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) growth trajectory is exceptional. On August 2, Nick Jones, Citizens JMP equity research analyst, joined Yahoo Finance to discuss his case for AMZN. He shares that AWS has outperformed market expectations, despite the total revenue falling short of its guidance in Q3. Jones adds that AMZN is yet to explore a multitude of opportunities to expand globally, and while he acknowledges that AMZN is massive, he states it is still in growth mode.\nThe company has been achieving milestone after milestone. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has not only been actively involved in the development of AI hardware and software but has also signed partnerships with the government and AI startups. To stay on track with innovation, on October 11, the company launched its first autonomous robot, Proteus, that can complete miscellaneous tasks in the Amazon fulfillment centers independently and safely.\nSimilarly, in a recent development, on October 16, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced its plans to invest in nuclear energy to meet the power demand from AI data centers. Amazon Web Services, AWS, signed a partnership with Dominion Energy and X-Energy to develop small modular reactors in Virginia. The deal was closed shortly after MSFT and GOOGL announced similar plans to invest in nuclear energy projects. The total investment in nuclear energy amounts to nearly $500 million.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has significant growth potential and to achieve such the company is working tirelessly. Over the next few years, the company is not only poised to become a fully functional AI company but it is also on track to become carbon-free.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The second is slowing down the response time of AI and its underlying large language models (LLMs).\nThe latter is a concept being adopted by the tech industry at large, known as \"the reasoning phase.\" As Sequoia Capital said in a recent blog, \"It\u2019s not enough for [language] models to simply know things \u2014 they need to pause, evaluate and reason through decisions in real time.\"\nGary Lynch, Verizon's (VZ) global practice leader of healthcare and life sciences, noted the first theme: the need to solve existing problems.\n\"When you walk the [conference] floor, you see a lot of these new, interesting clinical applications. But we really have to help our hospital partners with the operational efficiencies or we're never going to get to remote surgeries,\" Lynch said.\nDoes AI mean less paperwork for doctors? (Getty Creative) \u00b7 Tom Werner via Getty Images\nCompanies such as Verizon and Nvidia (NVDA) are keys to the foundation that the technology needs to be built on, while companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) offer a base \u2014 like cloud computing and paid access to their AI tools \u2014 to create solutions that could revolutionize the industry. They all had a presence at HLTH this year and spoke to Yahoo Finance about the progress made in the industry.\nThe idea of automating tasks isn't new, but the technology is finally in a place where it is now a reality, experts told Yahoo Finance at the conference.\n\"Over the last year and a half, a lot of these new platforms ... all these capabilities didn't exist,\" said Umesh Rustogi, Microsoft health and life sciences data platform general manager.\nThe most prominent example is AI \u2014 or ambient\u2014 scribes, which listen to and transcribe patient visits and then identify relevant information, like reasons for the visit and what the doctor advised or prescribed, to add to a patient's electronic health record. (Companies like Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN) have launched these products in the past year, resulting, some experts say, in hours of physician time saved.)\nTampa General Hospital CEO John Couris said the scribes have helped improve the quality of patient visits while also helping reduce the burden on physicians after hours. \"They're working at 7, 8 o'clock at night, when they're at their kids' baseball game, or they're working at 11, 12, or 1 in the morning doing notes. That's not sustainable, it's not right,\" Couris said.\nStory Continues\nThere are other solutions on the horizon, according to Verizon's Lynch.\n\"I'll give you an example: asset tracking. A nurse spends an hour of his or her day just looking for stuff. So we're building a solution where a nurse can grab their phone and say, 'Where's the nearest wheelchair? Where's the nearest IV pump?'\" he said.\nThe ideal solution would be one that integrates into existing systems, rather than create more disparate systems \u2014 known as point solutions \u2014 for hospitals to install and track, Lynch said.\nThere is broad agreement that healthcare needs to be changed in major ways, said Greg Corrado, senior research director at Google AI.\nAI may finally be delivering on its promises to health care providers. (Getty Creative) \u00b7 JohnnyGreig via Getty Images\nBut it won't be easy, and no one company can do it. Instead it might take more collaboration between tech companies and hospitals.\n\"What matters most is that we don't work in this sector like 7-year-olds playing soccer... [where] everybody's on the ball, and they're missing the bigger opportunity,\" he said.\nThat being said, AI is finally fulfilling the promise of digital health for providers.\n\"AI is certainly still the big buzzword. Everyone's got AI in their booth,\" Verizon's Lynch said.\nBut it isn't going to be as simple as plug and play, Google's Corrado said.\n\"I don't think that it's going to work very well to just imagine that we can do everything the way that we've been doing it in medicine the last 50 years, and we're just going to add AI,\" he said.\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best delivery stocks to invest in now.\nAn Overview of the Delivery and Courier Industry\nThe delivery and courier industry is diverse, encompassing a wide range of services that connect businesses and consumers through various shipping methods. Parcel delivery services are a major component, with companies offering both domestic and international shipping options, driven by the rise of e-commerce.\nAnother significant segment is food delivery platforms. These platforms connect hungry customers with local eateries, creating a new business model that thrives on convenience. Overall, the delivery industry is evolving rapidly, with diverse players working to meet the growing expectations for speed and reliability in shipping services.\nAccording to Zion Market Research, the global on-demand delivery market was valued at $15.19 billion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.90% during 2024-2032 to reach $83.82 billion by the end of the forecast period. In 2023, the Asia-Pacific region led the market in revenue and is projected to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period.\nRead Also: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThis growth is fueled by increasing consumer expectations for fast and reliable delivery services, particularly same-day and next-day options. Experts highlight that the demand for quick deliveries has led to substantial investments in last-mile delivery solutions and advanced technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn 2024, consumers have continued to prioritize free and fast shipping for their online orders, according to recent data from Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights. A survey of 1,013 online shoppers revealed that 81.34% consider free shipping their top priority when receiving deliveries. Fast shipping follows closely, with 68.41% of respondents highlighting its importance. Additionally, 55.68% of consumers emphasized the need for retailers to keep products in stock and ready to ship.\nAI and automation are key trends that are significantly transforming the delivery services industry, making operations more efficient and responsive to consumer demands. For example, companies like DHL Express have introduced the DHLBot in Singapore and South Korea. The DHLBot is an AI-powered robotics arm that can sort over 1,000 small parcels per hour with 99% accuracy. This technology not only speeds up the sorting process but also reduces labor costs and minimizes errors, allowing for quicker deliveries.\nStory Continues\nAs the industry evolves, it is clear that AI and automation will play a crucial role in shaping the future of delivery services.\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 7 best delivery stocks to invest in now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest delivery companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources. From an initial pool of more than 20 delivery stocks, we focused on the top 7 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 7 best delivery stocks to invest in now are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Revolutionizing Delivery with Record Speed and Prime Benefits\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a major American technology company known for its extensive e-commerce platform, which offers a wide variety of products ranging from books to electronics. The company has grown to become the world\u2019s largest online retailer and a leader in cloud computing through its Amazon Web Services (AWS). A key aspect of its business is its delivery services, which include fast shipping options like Amazon Prime, allowing members to receive their orders quickly through same-day delivery, one-day delivery, and two-day delivery service options.\nThe company\u2019s innovative logistics network continues to redefine online shopping and delivery experiences globally. At the end of July, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a remarkable achievement in its delivery service, reporting that over 5 billion items have already been delivered the same or next day globally this year, marking a 30% increase from the previous year. This record speed not only benefits Prime members by allowing them to receive products faster but also supports small and medium-sized businesses, with many of these deliveries made on behalf of independent sellers using the company\u2019s Fulfillment by Amazon service. Since the launch of Prime in 2005, the selection of items eligible for free Prime shipping has expanded from just one million to over 300 million, with tens of millions available for Same-Day or One-Day Delivery. This means that Prime members now enjoy 20 times more options delivered much quicker than before, enhancing the overall value of their membership.\nIn November 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) surpassed UPS in parcel volume in 2022 and surpassed FedEx in 2020, with expectations that this lead will continue to grow based on internal Amazon data.\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is actively enhancing its services to provide even greater value to its Prime members, which makes it an attractive delivery stock to consider.\nIn the first half of 2024, the company achieved record delivery speeds and this rapid delivery is supported by an expanded selection of products, including popular brands like A\u00e9ropostale and Kiehl\u2019s. Additionally, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) now offers US Prime members a Grubhub+ membership, valued at $120 a year, and has launched grocery delivery subscriptions that allow unlimited deliveries for a low monthly fee when shopping at the company\u2019s fresh stores in the US and the UK.\nMoreover, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is leveraging advanced technology, including AI-powered features like the shopping assistant Rufus, to improve customer experience. The company has also expanded its pharmacy services, providing Medicare members access to essential medications for just $5 a month.\nThese strategic initiatives combined with the company\u2019s focus on speed, selection, and added value position Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a strong contender in the delivery market. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, AMZN has gained significant interest from institutional investors, with the number of hedge fund holders increasing to 308 in Q2 2024, up from 302 in the previous quarter.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of best delivery stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of delivery companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Additionally, Netflix\u2019s high user engagement makes it an attractive platform for advertisers, positioning the company as a strong contender in the digital advertising space.

NFLX\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 43.64 and 32.26 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n15 Most Watched TV Shows Of 2023\nalin-surdu-j5GCqQM3eYA-unsplash (1)\nNetflix (NFLX) delivered a strong Q3 performance, surpassing expectations and reinforcing its position as a leader in the streaming industry. The company reported revenue growth of 2.8% QoQ and 15% YoY, with revenue beating estimates by $57 million. GAAP EPS also exceeded expectations at $5.40, while subscriber numbers surged to 282.7 million, outpacing estimates by 4 million. The net income margin reached an impressive 24.1%, up 450 basis points compared to the same quarter last year, signaling operational efficiency despite competitive pressures.\nDespite facing stiff competition from peers like Disney and Amazon Prime, Netflix\u2019s Q3 results have displayed its ability to maintain its competitive edge. Netflix's strategy of expanding beyond traditional streaming, into areas like live events, gaming, advertising, and international markets, has broadened its total addressable market. The platform's ability to secure high-profile events, such as the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match and NFL games, exemplifies its ability to capture large, engaged audiences.\nNetflix\u2019s approach to flexible pricing models has also been key to sustaining growth. In some regions, such as Japan, the U.S., and Spain, prices have been raised, while in other markets, the company has introduced lower-priced, ad-supported plans. These ad-supported tiers now account for over 50% of new sign-ups, offering a solution for price-sensitive consumers while allowing Netflix to monetize a broader audience. However, the introduction of ad-supported plans also reflects underlying consumer weakness, highlighting the company's need to balance affordability with profitability.\nThe ad platform, still in its early stages, offers significant long-term potential. Despite growing competition in the digital advertising space, Netflix's unmatched audience engagement provides a unique value proposition to advertisers. As companies increasingly invest in digital ads, Netflix stands out by offering premium placements in highly anticipated content, positioning itself as a future leader in this lucrative market. With strong user engagement, the company can command high CPMs, giving it a competitive edge over other platforms.\nStory Continues\nInternational expansion remains another key opportunity for Netflix. Revenue growth of 16% YoY in both the U.S. and Canada and EMEA markets, alongside 19% growth in Asia Pacific and 9% in LATAM, demonstrates Netflix's ability to scale globally, although volatility remains in emerging markets.\nBasically, the bullish thesis on Netflix stems from the fact that the company is diversifying its revenue streams and expanding its total addressable market (TAM). Netflix\u2019s venturing into live events, gaming, and introducing lower-cost, ad-supported plans are opening up new growth opportunities beyond traditional streaming. Additionally, Netflix\u2019s high user engagement makes it an attractive platform for advertisers, positioning the company as a strong contender in the digital advertising space. Lastly, international markets, especially Asia-Pacific and Latin America, present significant growth opportunities, further enhancing its global scale and long-term potential.\nNetflix, Inc. is on our list of the\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks with consistent growth to buy.\nCurrently, financial markets are experiencing a mix of optimism and caution as investors react to changing economic conditions. Many are closely watching trends and data that could impact future growth and stability.\nTom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently shared his insights on the current market trends during an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 14. He acknowledged that he underestimated the strength of the market, noting that it has been surprisingly resilient despite expectations of volatility leading up to the 2024 election. Lee highlighted that there is a significant amount of cash\u2014about $6 trillion\u2014sitting on the sidelines, which has contributed to the market\u2019s stability. He observed that many investors had anticipated a recession, but instead, companies have shown strong earnings and resilience.\nLee also mentioned that the Federal Reserve is likely to adopt a supportive stance as inflation data continues to trend toward their 2% target. He believes that regardless of who wins the upcoming election, stocks are likely to perform well in the following year. Lee pointed out that markets tend to thrive on visibility and certainty, suggesting that if one candidate appears to be gaining an advantage, it could lead to a more favorable trading environment before the election. Overall, he remains optimistic about the market\u2019s outlook.\nS&P 500 and Dow Reach New Heights Ahead of Election Season\nOn October 18, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached new record highs, marking six consecutive weeks of gains for these major indices. As reported by CNBC, the S&P 500 rose by 0.40%, closing at 5,864.67, while the Dow rose by 0.09% and added 36.86 points to close at 43,275.91. The Nasdaq also performed well, increasing 0.63% to close at 18,489.55. This marks the longest winning streak of the year for both the Dow and S&P 500, with notable increases in their overall performance.\nAs earnings season progresses, over 70 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their results, with about 75% of those companies surpassing expectations. Despite potential market volatility leading up to the upcoming election, some analysts believe that stocks may continue to rise through November.\nRob Williams, a chief investment strategist at Sage Advisory, noted that this trend is unusual for an election year, where markets typically hesitate before improving post-election. He suggested that investors might be optimistic about a possible victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose policies are seen as more favorable for businesses in terms of regulations and taxes.\nStory Continues\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners.

          "whole_article": "Netflix's stock has surged by over 80% year-on-year, adding to its illustrious success story. Although consistent product uptake and successful company-level execution likely warrant its latest gains, revising Netflix's stock might be prudent as headwinds have emerged. For example, streaming-as-a-concept has matured, concurrently enhancing Netflix's competitive environment. Moreover, Netflix's stock has outperformed most high-beta technology stocks in the past year, suggesting mean reversion is possible.\nThe abovementioned factors illustrate a juxtaposition, providing latitude to assess Netflix stock's near-term prospects; herewith is an examination of Netflix's salient variables.\nOperating Review\nHeadline Figures\nNetflix's broad-based revenue has grown at a staggering pace this year. For example, the company delivered $9.56 billion in second-quarter revenue, a 16.8% year-over-year increase, illustrating Netflix's ability to sustain real growth and pass inflation to its consumers. Furthermore, Netflix's operating profit margin settled at 27.2% in its second quarter, a 4.9% improvement from a year earlier, which affirms Netflix's constant shareholder value additivity.\nNetflix: Additional Upside Possible Amid International Growth, Valuation Tailwinds\nSource: Netflix\nSegmental Analysis: Geographically Grouped\nNetflix's United States and Canada (UCAN) segment, which accounts for about 45% of the company's revenue mix, delivered $4.296 billion in second-quarter earnings, up 7% year-over-year. Although the segment's real growth was positive, its average revenue per membership pulled back by 13 cents quarter-over-quarter to $17.17, while its paid net additions decelerated to 1.45 million from 2.53 million a quarter ago.\nDespite experiencing showing slower per-user growth, UCAN provides a solid revenue base while Netflix expands into international markets. Additionally, the segment offers advertising revenue conversion potential amid its consistent demand and high per-user monetization ratio.\nNetflix: Additional Upside Possible Amid International Growth, Valuation Tailwinds\nSource: Author's Work, Data Provided By Netflix (UCAN)\nAs previously mentioned, Netflix's international expansion might be pivotal. Netflix generated around $1.2 billion in second-quarter revenue through its Latin American (LATAM) operations. As illustrated in the following diagram, Netflix's LATAM segment has grown considerably, with double-digit fx-adjusted growth recorded in its past three quarters.\nNetflix: Additional Upside Possible Amid International Growth, Valuation Tailwinds\nSource: Author's Work, Data Provided By Netflix (LATAM)\nNetflix LATAM expansion suggests it has benefitted from growing emerging economies, consumer density, and revenue diversification.\nStory Continues\nThe company's EMEA expansion follows a similar route as it hosts European, Middle Eastern, and African consumers. Headline metrics and anecdotes suggest that Netflix needs to optimize regional content to EMEA consumers' preferences to accelerate growth. Although other factors might contribute, data sampling, accelerated partnership growth, and marketing attempts will likely play a pivotal role in enhancing Netflix's EMEA reach.\nNetflix: Additional Upside Possible Amid International Growth, Valuation Tailwinds\nSource: Author's Work, Data Provided By Netflix (EMEA)\nThe Asian Pacific consumer base provides Netflix with a potential hidden asset.\nNetflix generates approximately 11% of its revenue from its Asia Pacific operations, which have delivered negative growth in each of Netflix's last five quarters. While segmental growth has slowed, China is set to inject a reported $1.07 trillion stimulus package into its economy. A stimulus package might propel the APAC region's consumer sentiment and inflate interrelated economies, resulting in an enhanced systematic outlook for Netflix's APAC segment. Even though the stimulus package might not cure APAC's structural concerns, a better consumer environment provides a starting point.\nNetflix: Additional Upside Possible Amid International Growth, Valuation Tailwinds\nSource: Author's Work, Data Provided By Netflix (APAC)\nCurrent Fundamental Value Drivers\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising through streaming can be successful if robust data aggregation and prudent advert insertion are emphasized. For example, anecdotal evidence points toward YouTube's successful advertising model, which is subtle yet effective.\nNetflix didn't disclose its second-quarter advertising revenue in a separate line item, yet its management stated that it increased its advertising member base by 34% quarter-over-quarter.\nAlthough disputed by some, Netflix's tier-based membership likely provides a revenue multiplier and target market differentiation, allowing the company to be more dynamic with its price structure while diversifying its end market.\nCross-Selling Gaming\nNetflix's expansion into gaming provides an exciting angle. An isolated view suggests that Netflix's gaming segment isn't a world-beater on a standalone basis. However, uptake in gaming can be amplified through cross-selling Netflix's core streaming products and vice versa.\nFurthermore, to enhance the gaming segment's engagement, Netflix aims to dial in on its gaming initiatives in the coming years.\nAccording to Netflix's management: \"Starting in July, we'll launch about one new title per month like Emily in Paris and Selling Sunset. Separately, we will premiere a multiplayer game based on the Squid Game universe later this year, timed to the launch of season two of our biggest TV series ever.\"\nIf successful, Netflix's enhanced focus on gaming lends it a new market opportunity with cross-sales synergies.\nProduct and Content Partnerships\nA more extensive subscriber reach has benefitted Netflix's revenue mix. Nonetheless, challenges such as content preferences, language barriers, and marketing budgets have emerged. While posing a threat, Netflix's substantial product development budget can mitigate systemic challenges, allowing it to aggregate and assess data to refine its end-market delivery. Therefore, geographic content inefficiencies will likely submerge.\nAs for partnerships, Netflix's comprehensive market share provides it access to best-in-class partnership programs, consequently allowing the company to benefit from on-device accessibility, cross-marketing, and business-to-business synergies.\nEmerging Markets\nNetflix's LATAM and APAC exposure illustrate its desire to expand into emerging markets. Emerging markets provide Netflix with renewed growth opportunities, especially as its hefty brand name often leads to seamless market entry.\nThe following diagram illustrates emerging markets' potential through gross domestic product growth. Netflix's market representation might be independent of regional growth rates. Nevertheless, systematic support provides a telling baseline.\nNetflix: Additional Upside Possible Amid International Growth, Valuation Tailwinds\nSource: Statista\nChallenges\nCrowding\nNielsen recently published a report that alluded to streaming's share of U.S. screen time and Netflix's role within it. According to Nielsen, Netflix possesses a robust point-in-time market share of 8.4%. However, a closer observation shows that market fragmentation has occurred. For example, middle-market players such as Pluto, Paramount, Peacock, Hulu, Tubi, Roku, and Max have earned noteworthy market shares. Moreover, Netflix has noteworthy competition in foreign markets, with industry participants like iQIYI, Tencent Video, and Le.com threatening Netflix's APAC market share through their foreign expansion intiatives.\nCoalition tactics, such as mass acquisitions or excess internal investment, might keep Netflix from touching distance. However, market saturation risk will likely remain as the streaming business exits its initial growth phase.\nNetflix: Additional Upside Possible Amid International Growth, Valuation Tailwinds\nSource: Nielsen\nF/X Management\nAn overlooked risk factor is Netflix's operational hedging duties, which include managing its currency basket.\nThe company's global diversification means its currency exposure is diversified. Nonetheless, Netflix's content-based expenses, operating liability structure, and employee wages must be matched by guiding its fx-adjusted income into the necessary channels. Executing such hedges can be difficult as the company derives much of its revenue from LATAM, an unstable currency environment. For instance, Netflix recently pointed out that the Argentinian Peso played a significant part in its average revenue per member line item when it stated that \"the primary difference between F/X neutral and reported growth was large peso price increases in Argentina due to local inflation and the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the US dollar.\"\nValuation\nForward P/E\nThe price-to-earnings expansion formula provides a valuable guidepost when assessing a stock's valuation outlook, especially for a stock such as Netflix, which has abundant influencing variables. Although merely an indicator, the formula embodies Occum's Razor Law, which states that the simplest explanation is usually the one the one closest to the truth.\nAccording to the expanded price-to-earning formula, Netflix is undervalued by about 38.7%, presenting investors with a noteworthy value gap.\nNetflix: Additional Upside Possible Amid International Growth, Valuation Tailwinds\nSource: Author's Work - Data Provided By Market Screener & Yahoo Finance\nStock Buybacks and Capital Structure\nNetflix completed $1.6 billion in stock buybacks during its second quarter, which naturally lowered the cost basis of its existing investors. The company's current buyback plan has $5 billion in remaining capacity, suggesting additional buybacks are on the horizon.\nFurthermore, Netflix has $1.8 billion in debt maturing within the next twelve months, which it plans to refinance. Although debatable, lower U.S. interest rates and sustained stock buybacks likely translate into a favorable valuation outlook through a lower cost of capital and a reduced share float.\nTechnical Analysis\nNetflix's stock is above its 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages, yet its 14-day relative strength index remains below 70, suggesting the stock has yet to reach overbought territory.\nNetflix: Additional Upside Possible Amid International Growth, Valuation Tailwinds\nSource: Gurufocus\nThe options market supports Netflix's technical outlook as its Put /Call ratio of 1.38 implies a bullish short-term outlook from options traders. Even though the Put-Call ratio can be countercyclical, it would likely require a cataclysmic event to swing traders' sentiment.\nIn Summary\nNetflix has experienced scintillating growth in Latin America, which has spurred its broad-based earnings. In addition, the company's advertising wing has benefitted from stable, broad-based growth.\nFurthermore, Netflix possesses overlooked tailwinds from cross-selling its gaming division, delivering curated products to its various segments, and possessing best-in-class corporate partnerships.\nAlthough mean-reversion is a noteworthy consideration, the price-to-earnings expansion formula conveys that Netflix is undervalued, which is supported by the company's comprehensive share buyback plan. Moreover, a technical analysis indicates that Netflix has yet to reach overbought territory.\nCertainty is never a given in the financial markets. Nonetheless, Netflix's stock seems poised for additional gains!\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Domestic and international subscribers can watch them on a host of internet-connected devices, including television sets, computers, and mobile devices.\n\nThe Los Gatos, CA-based company reported revenues of $33.72 billion in 2023.\n\nBeginning fourth-quarter 2019, Netflix started declaring revenues and membership data by regions \u2014 the Asia Pacific (APAC); Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Latin America (LATAM); and the United States and Canada (UCAN).\n\nUCAN accounted for 44.9% of second-quarter 2024 revenues. At the end of the quarter, the company had 84.11 million paid subscribers in the region.\n\nEMEA accounted for 31.5% of second-quarter 2024 revenues. Netflix had 93.96 million paid subscribers in the region at the end of the quarter.\n\nLATAM contributed 12.6% of second-quarter 2024 revenues and had 49.25 million paid subscribers in the region at the end of the quarter.\n\nAPAC accounted for 11% of second-quarter 2024 revenues. The company had 50.23 million paid subscribers in the region at the end of the quarter.\nBottom Line\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Netflix ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nStory Continues\nA $1000 investment made in October 2014 would be worth $14,766.85, or a 1,376.69% gain, as of October 22, 2024, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 201.55% and gold's return of 109.70% over the same time frame.\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for NFLX.\nNetflix\u2019s third-quarter 2024 results benefited from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention. The planned launch of an in-house ad tech platform in 2025 signals Netflix's commitment to maximizing this new revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year in 2025. Netflix has raised its guidance for the full year 2024, projecting revenue growth at the high end of its previous 14-15% range. Shares have outperformed the industry year to date. However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ is a headwind. NFLX\u2019s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.\nShares have gained 9.46% over the past four weeks and there have been 11 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)X the Best FAANG Stock To Buy According to Analysts?\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nAnalyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 4.29%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), commonly referred to as the AI star and AI winner, ranks 7th on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nOn October 19, Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he suggested that Nvidia, without a doubt, is the AI winner and will be the first company to reach a $4 trillion valuation. He adds that he expects the stock to reach $150 by the end of 2024, as other companies continue to make investments in GPU compute. Previously on October 15, Ben Reitzes, Melius Research\u2019s head of technology research, appeared in an interview on CNBC, where he shared his stance on the stock. Like Ahluwalia, Reitzes is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and expects the stock to trade at one time its P/E to growth ratio in 2025, highly attractive for an influential name like NVDA.\nThere is no doubt about NVIDIA\u2019s position in the technology and AI sector. On October 21, the company announced a partnership with Deloitte to deploy digital AI agents for healthcare. On the same day, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined hands with Microsoft to support AI startups across the globe with a focus on healthcare and life sciences in the first phase. The two companies will pan out to other industries in future phases. NVDA will provide inference credits to run GPU-optimized AI models and MSFT will offer Azure credits to access leading AI models.\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides AI hardware and software products to high-growth markets, medium-sized companies, and mega-cap stocks, that have been pouring billions into enhancing their AI infrastructure. In the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company expects to generate $32.5 billion in revenue, which is likely to come from its rapidly growing Hopper architecture and its new and improved Blackwell Chips.\nIthaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\"\nOverall NVDA ranks 7th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Last year, generative AI was the talk of the town at the annual HLTH conference in Vegas. It was a breakthrough the health tech industry folks needed and held the promise of everything from virtually diagnosing patients to conducting surgeries to finding disease cures.\nThis year, key industry players are adopting a more measured tone.\nTwo themes emerged at this year's HLTH, hosted at the Venetian Expo. The first is to help automate mundane tasks to avoid the \"crisis level\" of burnout. The second is slowing down the response time of AI and its underlying large language models (LLMs).\nThe latter is a concept being adopted by the tech industry at large, known as \"the reasoning phase.\" As Sequoia Capital said in a recent blog, \"It\u2019s not enough for [language] models to simply know things \u2014 they need to pause, evaluate and reason through decisions in real time.\"\nGary Lynch, Verizon's (VZ) global practice leader of healthcare and life sciences, noted the first theme: the need to solve existing problems.\n\"When you walk the [conference] floor, you see a lot of these new, interesting clinical applications. But we really have to help our hospital partners with the operational efficiencies or we're never going to get to remote surgeries,\" Lynch said.\nDoes AI mean less paperwork for doctors? (Getty Creative) \u00b7 Tom Werner via Getty Images\nCompanies such as Verizon and Nvidia (NVDA) are keys to the foundation that the technology needs to be built on, while companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) offer a base \u2014 like cloud computing and paid access to their AI tools \u2014 to create solutions that could revolutionize the industry. They all had a presence at HLTH this year and spoke to Yahoo Finance about the progress made in the industry.\nThe idea of automating tasks isn't new, but the technology is finally in a place where it is now a reality, experts told Yahoo Finance at the conference.\n\"Over the last year and a half, a lot of these new platforms ... all these capabilities didn't exist,\" said Umesh Rustogi, Microsoft health and life sciences data platform general manager.\nThe most prominent example is AI \u2014 or ambient\u2014 scribes, which listen to and transcribe patient visits and then identify relevant information, like reasons for the visit and what the doctor advised or prescribed, to add to a patient's electronic health record. (Companies like Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN) have launched these products in the past year, resulting, some experts say, in hours of physician time saved.)\nTampa General Hospital CEO John Couris said the scribes have helped improve the quality of patient visits while also helping reduce the burden on physicians after hours. \"They're working at 7, 8 o'clock at night, when they're at their kids' baseball game, or they're working at 11, 12, or 1 in the morning doing notes. That's not sustainable, it's not right,\" Couris said.\nStory Continues\nThere are other solutions on the horizon, according to Verizon's Lynch.\n\"I'll give you an example: asset tracking. A nurse spends an hour of his or her day just looking for stuff. So we're building a solution where a nurse can grab their phone and say, 'Where's the nearest wheelchair? Where's the nearest IV pump?'\" he said.\nThe ideal solution would be one that integrates into existing systems, rather than create more disparate systems \u2014 known as point solutions \u2014 for hospitals to install and track, Lynch said.\nThere is broad agreement that healthcare needs to be changed in major ways, said Greg Corrado, senior research director at Google AI.\nAI may finally be delivering on its promises to health care providers. (Getty Creative) \u00b7 JohnnyGreig via Getty Images\nBut it won't be easy, and no one company can do it. Instead it might take more collaboration between tech companies and hospitals.\n\"What matters most is that we don't work in this sector like 7-year-olds playing soccer... [where] everybody's on the ball, and they're missing the bigger opportunity,\" he said.\nThat being said, AI is finally fulfilling the promise of digital health for providers.\n\"AI is certainly still the big buzzword. Everyone's got AI in their booth,\" Verizon's Lynch said.\nBut it isn't going to be as simple as plug and play, Google's Corrado said.\n\"I don't think that it's going to work very well to just imagine that we can do everything the way that we've been doing it in medicine the last 50 years, and we're just going to add AI,\" he said.\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

          "whole_article": "While the EU remains a distant third in comparing the investment in artificial intelligence with the United States and China, Nvidia's (NVDA, Financial) chief executive officer, Jensen Huang, snaps the EU awake. During the launch of the new supercomputer Gefion in Copenhagen, Huanga stressed the centrality of data and appealed to the EU to expedite AI. Nevertheless, Europe's engagements in the AI sphere are relatively low, although European states were the first to set strict AI regulations; new players are overtaking European newcomers like Mistral from France and Aleph Alpha from Germany.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nGefion is a research project established by Nvidia, a leading maker of GPU's crucial for AI processes, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, and the Danish Export and Investment Fund. Packed with 1,528 GPUs, this supercomputer is expected to transform drug discovery and life sciences in pursuit of what Huang calls this decade of digital biology.\nAt the same time, the EU is increasingly scrutinizing antitrust actions, especially those geared toward Big Tech and foreign subsidies. In her statement, Teresa Ribera, the nominee for the next antitrust chief, assured us that she would strictly enforce the Digital Markets Act so that unfair competition would not work against European companies. This encompasses protecting small- to medium-sized enterprises from losing deals with other companies and the competitive mismatch challenges that EU firms face globally, particularly in clean technology.\nThe forthcoming industrial strategy of the Union, expected to connect with broad regulatory changes and possibly rebalance state aid, is designed to generate a competitive and long-lasting industrial structure. As these challenges unfold across such a diverse strategic landscape in Europe, the proper combination of vital artificial intelligence and potent antitrust policies and measures will be indispensable for the continent's economy and technology.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- After a 150% rally that\u2019s added about $60 billion in market value, Wall Street thinks Palantir Technologies Inc. has gotten way ahead of itself.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nOman Sees an Urban Future Distinct From Dubai and Abu Dhabi\nClimate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nShares in the company, which makes data analysis tools for companies and governments, have soared this year, helped by its inclusion in the S&P 500 Index in September and its success in leveraging artificial intelligence. But analysts don\u2019t expect the winning streak to continue, with the average target implying a decline of more than 30% in the next 12 months \u2014 the most downside seen for any stock in the US benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nTheir caution mainly stems from Palantir\u2019s lofty valuation. The shares trade at more than 100 times future earnings, a hefty premium over other AI names, some of which are also considered too pricey by investors. Nvidia Corp. has a multiple of about 37 times forward earnings, while software firm Oracle Corp., which has also been riding AI-related tailwinds, trades at just 26 times.\nPalantir shares \u201cneed to consolidate stellar gains over the last couple of years and grow into its rich valuation,\u201d Raymond James analysts led by Brian Gesuale wrote in a recent note, downgrading the stock. The rally mean Palantir has \u201cno room for error\u201d when it reports earnings next month, he added.\nPalantir shares rose as much as 2.2% in early trading Thursday.\nWhile Palantir is now the third-best performer on the S&P 500 this year, behind Vistra Corp. and Nvidia, analysts are unusually negative for an AI-exposed name. Among 21 firms tracked by Bloomberg, only four recommend buying the stock, while ten have hold ratings and seven rate it a sell. The company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer, Alex Karp, has a love-hate relationship with Wall Street, and has said that analysts don\u2019t understand the company.\nStill, shares have kept on soaring, helped by the success of Palantir\u2019s AI tools, which have pulled in new customers including CBS Broadcasting, General Mills Inc. and Aramark Services Inc. this year. The company has also continued to win big contracts with government agencies in the US and allied countries, with government revenue making up the majority of overall sales.\nSome Palantir investors agree that the stock may see volatility after the huge rally.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIt\u2019s come so fast, there\u2019s going to be bumps along the way,\u201d said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager at Equity Armor Investments LLC. \u201cWith such an extremely high valuation, it can fall on bad news,\u201d he said, adding that Palantir potentially has significantly more room to run.\nThe next test of the stock will come when Palantir reports results in November. Analysts estimate third-quarter revenue of $702 million, up 26% from last year, with earnings growth of 28%. Investors will also be looking for updates on new customers.\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned about their total clients,\u201d said Tigay, adding that growing the client list is more important for Palantir in the short term than the bottom line.\nJim Worden, chief investment officer of Wealth Consulting Group, said that while the stock may be volatile into earnings, that doesn\u2019t have to be bad, and could mean more upside. At the same time, Palantir\u2019s business with government agencies provides an anchor.\nPalantir has \u201cthis first mover advantage \u2014 the government contracts are sticky and there\u2019s a high cost to switch,\u201d said Worden, who also owns the stock. The company has won a range of recent government contracts, including for building out an AI platform for the military.\nStill, the big driver for further growth will be winning more corporate customers for its AI platform, released in 2023. Palantir has been trying to bring in more customers by hosting boot camps, which bring together the company\u2019s engineers with potential and current customers to test out its software.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to show tangible incremental progress with their AI boot camps,\u201d said Hilary Frisch, director and senior research analyst at ClearBridge Investments LLC, who also holds the stock. \u201cIf they show incremental progress at the margins that would be positive.\u201d\nFrisch said that recent gains for Palantir have probably been driven by retail investors, not institutional ones, while its recent addition to the S&P 500 may have caused some volatility. The inclusion means the company will be added to index-tracking funds held by major investors.\nAfter the boost from being added to a major index, companies often have to spend some time growing into their valuation, Frisch said.\nTop Tech Stories\nTesla Inc. shares climbed in early trading after the carmaker reported surprisingly strong earnings and forecast as much as 30% growth in vehicle sales next year.\nNvidia Corp.\u2019s Jensen Huang struck a partnership with Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, to build out artificial intelligence infrastructure and spur the technology\u2019s adoption in the world\u2019s most populous country.\nSK Hynix Inc. posted record quarterly profit and revenue, reflecting strong demand for the memory chips used with Nvidia Corp. processors for artificial intelligence development.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. discovered this month that chips it made for a specific customer ended up with Huawei Technologies Co., a potential violation of US sanctions intended to sever the flow of technology to a Chinese national champion.\nServiceNow Inc. reported strong third-quarter sales and bookings, but failed to clear the lofty expectations of investors looking for a bigger boost from artificial intelligence.\nEarnings Due Thursday\nPremarket\nOSI Systems\nNetScout\nRogers Communications\nPostmarket\nWestern Digital\nVeriSign\nSPS Commerce\nAppfolio\nRogers\nKnowles\n(Adds stock in move in paragraph five at market open)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nHome Depot\u2019s 12-Foot Skeletons Spawned an Industry of Giant Halloween Decor\nThe Surprisingly Lucrative Business of Recycled E-Waste\nOnce You Try a Four-Day Workweek, It\u2019s Hard to Go Back\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Microsoft recently struck a deal to restart of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. Google partnered with small modular reactor developer Kairos to build 500MW of generation capacity. Amazon bought stock in another SMR developer, X-energy. Big Oil loves nuclear. This could change the course of the energy transition.\nUntil quite recently, Big Tech was fully dedicated to the energy transition in its original form, envisaging a massive buildout of wind and solar capacity to replace gas and coal as sources of electricity. Then the AI race began, and Big Tech discovered something it should have known all along: it needed a lot of electricity that was available around the clock. Wind and solar couldn\u2019t cut it. So Big Tech turned to nuclear.\n\u201cNuclear plants are the only energy sources that can consistently deliver on that promise,\u201d Constellation Energy\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez said in comments on the Microsoft news, referring to the promise of abundant electricity supply with a low emissions footprint.\n\u201cThis agreement is a key part of our effort to commercialise and scale the advanced energy technologies we need to reach our net zero and 24/7 carbon-free energy goals and ensure that more communities benefit from clean and affordable power in the future,\u201d Google\u2019s senior director for energy and climate Michael Terell said in comments on the deal with Kairos Power.\nThe tech industry appears to have taken its time in realizing that clean power is not enough for their business ends, and they need power that is both clean and available around the clock\u2014and batteries cannot make wind and solar round-the-clock power sources.\nRelated: Strict Oil Sanctions Enforcement Could Cripple IRGC's Power\n\u201cThese large investments show the tech industry does not feel renewables and batteries can provide enough stable or cost-effective power and nuclear will be needed,\u201d the chair of the American Nuclear Society\u2019s International Council and chief executive of nuclear fuel producer Lightbridge Corporation told the FT last week. Indeed, it was high time someone acknowledged the shortcomings of the default energy sources of transition advocates who have not yet felt directly the need for reliable, in addition to non-hydrocarbon, electricity.\nIn fairness, Big Tech\u2019s big bet on nuclear will take a while to take shape. For example, Microsoft may have agreed with Constellation Energy to restart Three Mile Island, but the restart depends on permits yet to be granted by the relevant authorities\u2014and it is not a done deal in light of anti-nuclear sentiments among the public, Reuters reports.\nStory Continues\nSmall modular reaction technology has not been tested at a commercial scale yet, and the one project that tried to test it ultimately failed, with developer NuScale losing its deal with a Utah utility after it turned out the electricity its reactors would be generating was going to be a lot more expensive than original planned.\nYet, Big Tech has deep pockets and massive electricity needs that are only going to get even more massive in the coming years as the AI race heats up and data centers multiply. Indeed, various forecasts are naming data center proliferation as the top reason for a considerable future increase in U.S. electricity consumption after more than a decade of flat demand. Per Barclays, data centers alone will come to account for 9% of total U.S. demand for electricity by 2030. That would be up from just 3.5%. Per Wood Mac, total electricity demand in the U.S. could swell by up to 15% in the next five years. And it won\u2019t be wind and solar covering this demand if Big Tech is any judge.\nThe nuclear bet could be a disaster for wind and solar, and not just because nuclear is a direct rival for the love of some huge consumers of energy. That bet could mortally wound wind and solar because of carbon credits.\nRight now, Big Tech majors are the biggest clients of companies engaged in the generation of electricity from wind and solar installations, for which generation these companies also receive so-called carbon credits. They are free to sell these credits to companies that want to reduce their emission footprint accumulated from their use of hydrocarbon sources of electricity for lack of comparable non-hydrocarbon alternatives. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are big consumers of carbon credits. But if those reactors get built, demand for carbon credits will take a plunge\u2014and it will never return.\nThis is a problem for wind and solar generators because those carbon credits are an important source of income. That source of income could become even more important as negative prices due to overproduction become more frequent. Yet Big Tech with its nuclear plans could put an end to this lucrative carbon credit trade because nuclear generation is zero-emission generation.\nGranted, this will take years to happen. There will be challenges as small modular reactor technology proves itself in the field. There will be failures and delays. But with Big GTech\u2019s money and its very urgent need for energy, chances are that nuclear will be making a major comeback. In the meantime, gas and even coal are guaranteed some stable demand growth from the data center world.\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nHarbour Energy Joins North Sea Oil Exodus Ahead Of Tax Hikes\nGold Surges to New Highs Amidst 'Trump Trade' Momentum\nIs The West Prepared To Deal With Potential Iranian Sabotage Of The Oil Market?\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\u201cWe Are Just at the Beginning of the AI Buildout\u201d\nEach of the big tech stocks has revealed its plans to invest $50 to $100 billion in GPU compute, evidence that Artificial intelligence may be the biggest theme right now. On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best FAANG Stock To Buy According to Analysts?\nGoogle\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nAnalyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 24.3%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that ranks first on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy according to hedge funds. It owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Wyamo.\nOn October 14, the company signed an agreement to purchase nuclear energy from small modular reactors to be developed by Kairos Power. The first phase of work is expected to bring small modular reactors online by 2030, followed by consequent developments through 2035. The deal will promise 500 megawatts of carbon-free energy to electricity grids in the United States.\nAlphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) performance in Q2 2024 was largely driven by its growing momentum in search and cloud. The company logged nearly $85 billion in revenue, of which search and cloud exceeded $10 billion for the first time in quarterly revenue. In addition to that, the company\u2019s processing units make up nearly 20% of the market, and market share is likely to expand as advancements continue.\nTo shed light on Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) position, Angelo Zino, CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance. Zino suggests that the company had been in beta mode for a long time and is now advancing towards AI at full speed. He adds that the company is excelling in every aspect of AI and is the ultimate consumer company, functioning as the internet.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\"\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st\u00a0among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Price and EPS Surprise\nAlphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\nAlphabet Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement:\nProliferation of Gen AI to Boost Alphabet\u2019s Q3 Results\nThe search giant\u2019s to-be-reported quarterly results are expected to benefit from Android\u2019s strength and solid momentum in search and cloud businesses. Expanding generative AI (Gen AI) capabilities are likely to have been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to have more than offset concerns related to increasing regulatory headwinds.\n\nAlphabet has been cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using Gen AI models, is expected to have helped expand its clientele. Google\u2019s launch of an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool called Gemini Code Assist is noteworthy.\n\nThese tools are likely to have contributed well to top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\nAI Integration Aids GOOGL\u2019s Search Traffic Growth\nGoogle\u2019s continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques to advance its search segment, which accounts for a major portion of its total revenues, are expected to have driven traffic on its platform in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThe integration of Gen AI technology into the search engine is expected to have continued to benefit Google Search. The Search Generative Experience (\u201cSGE\u201d), which leverages Gen AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is likely to have contributed well.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are expected to have contributed well. SGE is expected to have aided the advertisement business as it can create relevant, customized and high-quality ads.\n\nYouTube Shorts is likely to have continued its momentum in the to-be-reported quarter. Google\u2019s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are likely to have a positive impact.\nStory Continues\nGrowing Cloud Business: A Key Catalyst for GOOGL\nAlphabet has been rapidly growing in the booming cloud-computing market. Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud arm Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s MSFT Azure.\n\nThe solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is expected to have driven growth in the Google Cloud segment. Alphabet\u2019s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are expected to have been major positives.\n\nIts strengthening Gen AI-backed cloud offerings are expected to have driven Google Cloud\u2019s momentum among cloud customers in the to-be-reported-quarter.\nGOOGL Shares Lag Sector, Industry\nAlphabet\u2019s shares have appreciated 16.5% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, underperforming the Zacks Internet Services industry and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Over the same timeframe, the sector and industry have returned 17.2% and 27.1%, respectively.\n\nAlphabet shares have also underperformed its \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d peers Apple AAPL, Amazon, NVIDIA and Meta Platforms YTD. Microsoft and Tesla are the only two Magnificent 7 peers that have lagged the GOOGL shares over the same timeframe.\n\nApple, AMZN, NVIDIA, Meta Platforms and Microsoft shares have returned 19.9%, 21.6%, 181.8%, 59.3% and 12.9%, respectively. Tesla shares have declined 14% YTD.\nYTD Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet\u2019s underperformance can be attributed to growing regulatory concerns. It is facing increasing regulatory headwinds and global scrutiny over its search dominance.\n\nGoogle\u2019s alleged wrong practices constitute the utilization of Android to promote its own search engine unfairly. It is facing several lawsuits regarding data privacy, competition practices, AI usage, and copyright issues in several countries across the globe.\nGOOGL Shares Are Overvalued\nGOOGL shares are overvalued, as suggested by Value Score C.\n\nCurrently, GOOGL is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.27X compared with the industry\u2019s 5.88X.\nPrice/Sales (P/S) Ratio\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHere\u2019s Why GOOGL Shares Are a Buy Ahead of Q3\nAlphabet\u2019s growing GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver.\n\nDespite a stretched valuation, increasing regulatory concerns and stiff competition in the cloud space, these factors make GOOGL shares attractive for investors.\n\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

          "whole_article": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Last year, generative AI was the talk of the town at the annual HLTH conference in Vegas. It was a breakthrough the health tech industry folks needed and held the promise of everything from virtually diagnosing patients to conducting surgeries to finding disease cures.\nThis year, key industry players are adopting a more measured tone.\nTwo themes emerged at this year's HLTH, hosted at the Venetian Expo. The first is to help automate mundane tasks to avoid the \"crisis level\" of burnout. The second is slowing down the response time of AI and its underlying large language models (LLMs).\nThe latter is a concept being adopted by the tech industry at large, known as \"the reasoning phase.\" As Sequoia Capital said in a recent blog, \"It\u2019s not enough for [language] models to simply know things \u2014 they need to pause, evaluate and reason through decisions in real time.\"\nGary Lynch, Verizon's (VZ) global practice leader of healthcare and life sciences, noted the first theme: the need to solve existing problems.\n\"When you walk the [conference] floor, you see a lot of these new, interesting clinical applications. But we really have to help our hospital partners with the operational efficiencies or we're never going to get to remote surgeries,\" Lynch said.\nDoes AI mean less paperwork for doctors? (Getty Creative) \u00b7 Tom Werner via Getty Images\nCompanies such as Verizon and Nvidia (NVDA) are keys to the foundation that the technology needs to be built on, while companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) offer a base \u2014 like cloud computing and paid access to their AI tools \u2014 to create solutions that could revolutionize the industry. They all had a presence at HLTH this year and spoke to Yahoo Finance about the progress made in the industry.\nThe idea of automating tasks isn't new, but the technology is finally in a place where it is now a reality, experts told Yahoo Finance at the conference.\n\"Over the last year and a half, a lot of these new platforms ... all these capabilities didn't exist,\" said Umesh Rustogi, Microsoft health and life sciences data platform general manager.\nThe most prominent example is AI \u2014 or ambient\u2014 scribes, which listen to and transcribe patient visits and then identify relevant information, like reasons for the visit and what the doctor advised or prescribed, to add to a patient's electronic health record. (Companies like Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN) have launched these products in the past year, resulting, some experts say, in hours of physician time saved.)\nTampa General Hospital CEO John Couris said the scribes have helped improve the quality of patient visits while also helping reduce the burden on physicians after hours. \"They're working at 7, 8 o'clock at night, when they're at their kids' baseball game, or they're working at 11, 12, or 1 in the morning doing notes. That's not sustainable, it's not right,\" Couris said.\nStory Continues\nThere are other solutions on the horizon, according to Verizon's Lynch.\n\"I'll give you an example: asset tracking. A nurse spends an hour of his or her day just looking for stuff. So we're building a solution where a nurse can grab their phone and say, 'Where's the nearest wheelchair? Where's the nearest IV pump?'\" he said.\nThe ideal solution would be one that integrates into existing systems, rather than create more disparate systems \u2014 known as point solutions \u2014 for hospitals to install and track, Lynch said.\nThere is broad agreement that healthcare needs to be changed in major ways, said Greg Corrado, senior research director at Google AI.\nAI may finally be delivering on its promises to health care providers. (Getty Creative) \u00b7 JohnnyGreig via Getty Images\nBut it won't be easy, and no one company can do it. Instead it might take more collaboration between tech companies and hospitals.\n\"What matters most is that we don't work in this sector like 7-year-olds playing soccer... [where] everybody's on the ball, and they're missing the bigger opportunity,\" he said.\nThat being said, AI is finally fulfilling the promise of digital health for providers.\n\"AI is certainly still the big buzzword. Everyone's got AI in their booth,\" Verizon's Lynch said.\nBut it isn't going to be as simple as plug and play, Google's Corrado said.\n\"I don't think that it's going to work very well to just imagine that we can do everything the way that we've been doing it in medicine the last 50 years, and we're just going to add AI,\" he said.\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

          "whole_article": "The market expects Uber Technologies (UBER) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis ride-hailing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +310%.\nRevenues are expected to be $11 billion, up 18.4% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nStory Continues\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Uber?\nFor Uber, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +23.78%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination indicates that Uber will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Uber would post earnings of $0.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.47, delivering a surprise of +51.61%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nUber appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Services industry, Alphabet (GOOGL), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the quarter ended September 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $72.83 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet has been revised 0.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.40%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Alphabet will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nJefferies recently published a report citing an antitrust expert who believes it will take years for the DoJ to settle the case against Google.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe antitrust expert hosted by our US Internet team believes it could take 3 to 8 years to settle,\u201d analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note to clients.\nThe analyst specifically mentioned the impact of Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s loss in this case on Apple.\n\u201cWe est if AAPL loses 1/3 of GOOG rev (US only) as of FY28, our DCF will be ~8% (US$19) lower.\u201d\nLee, who holds a Hold rating on Apple, indicated that the revenue decline would only affect the U.S., though he warned that other countries might also react if the DOJ is successful. He assumes there would be no compensation from a revenue-sharing agreement with Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0or other search engines, representing the most pessimistic scenario.\nOakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-based communication services company\u2019s stock price fell after a U.S. District Court ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in general search engine services via exclusive distribution agreements. We think this case is unlikely to hurt Alphabet\u2019s valuation over the long term as regulations previously en[1]acted in the European Union to address similar issues did not materially erode the company\u2019s market share. We continue to believe that Alphabet is an attractive investment.\u201d\nOverall, GOOG ranks 6th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Revenues are expected to be $72.83 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, there has been an upward revision of 0.3% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Alphabet metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\nAnalysts expect 'Revenues- Google properties' to come in at $57.74 billion. The estimate points to a change of +11.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenues- Google Cloud' stands at $10.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +29.7% from the prior-year quarter.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenues- YouTube ads' will likely reach $8.86 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +11.4% year over year.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenues- Google advertising' should come in at $65.22 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +9.4%.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenues- Google Search & other' reaching $48.84 billion. The estimate points to a change of +10.9% from the year-ago quarter.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenues- Google Network' should arrive at $7.43 billion. The estimate points to a change of -3.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenues- EMEA' to reach $24.42 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.8%.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- United States' will reach $40.21 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +10.6% year over year.\nStory Continues\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenues- Other Americas (Canada and Latin America)' at $7.45 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +63.6%.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenues- APAC' will reach $14.06 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7.1% from the prior-year quarter.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Total TAC (traffic acquisition costs)' will reach $13.41 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $12.64 billion in the same quarter last year.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Headcount (Number of employees)' of 180,974. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 182,381 in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for Alphabet here>>>\n\nOver the past month, Alphabet shares have recorded returns of +0.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.5% change.

          "whole_article": "Microsoft recently struck a deal to restart of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. Google partnered with small modular reactor developer Kairos to build 500MW of generation capacity. Amazon bought stock in another SMR developer, X-energy. Big Oil loves nuclear. This could change the course of the energy transition.\nUntil quite recently, Big Tech was fully dedicated to the energy transition in its original form, envisaging a massive buildout of wind and solar capacity to replace gas and coal as sources of electricity. Then the AI race began, and Big Tech discovered something it should have known all along: it needed a lot of electricity that was available around the clock. Wind and solar couldn\u2019t cut it. So Big Tech turned to nuclear.\n\u201cNuclear plants are the only energy sources that can consistently deliver on that promise,\u201d Constellation Energy\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez said in comments on the Microsoft news, referring to the promise of abundant electricity supply with a low emissions footprint.\n\u201cThis agreement is a key part of our effort to commercialise and scale the advanced energy technologies we need to reach our net zero and 24/7 carbon-free energy goals and ensure that more communities benefit from clean and affordable power in the future,\u201d Google\u2019s senior director for energy and climate Michael Terell said in comments on the deal with Kairos Power.\nThe tech industry appears to have taken its time in realizing that clean power is not enough for their business ends, and they need power that is both clean and available around the clock\u2014and batteries cannot make wind and solar round-the-clock power sources.\nRelated: Strict Oil Sanctions Enforcement Could Cripple IRGC's Power\n\u201cThese large investments show the tech industry does not feel renewables and batteries can provide enough stable or cost-effective power and nuclear will be needed,\u201d the chair of the American Nuclear Society\u2019s International Council and chief executive of nuclear fuel producer Lightbridge Corporation told the FT last week. Indeed, it was high time someone acknowledged the shortcomings of the default energy sources of transition advocates who have not yet felt directly the need for reliable, in addition to non-hydrocarbon, electricity.\nIn fairness, Big Tech\u2019s big bet on nuclear will take a while to take shape. For example, Microsoft may have agreed with Constellation Energy to restart Three Mile Island, but the restart depends on permits yet to be granted by the relevant authorities\u2014and it is not a done deal in light of anti-nuclear sentiments among the public, Reuters reports.\nStory Continues\nSmall modular reaction technology has not been tested at a commercial scale yet, and the one project that tried to test it ultimately failed, with developer NuScale losing its deal with a Utah utility after it turned out the electricity its reactors would be generating was going to be a lot more expensive than original planned.\nYet, Big Tech has deep pockets and massive electricity needs that are only going to get even more massive in the coming years as the AI race heats up and data centers multiply. Indeed, various forecasts are naming data center proliferation as the top reason for a considerable future increase in U.S. electricity consumption after more than a decade of flat demand. Per Barclays, data centers alone will come to account for 9% of total U.S. demand for electricity by 2030. That would be up from just 3.5%. Per Wood Mac, total electricity demand in the U.S. could swell by up to 15% in the next five years. And it won\u2019t be wind and solar covering this demand if Big Tech is any judge.\nThe nuclear bet could be a disaster for wind and solar, and not just because nuclear is a direct rival for the love of some huge consumers of energy. That bet could mortally wound wind and solar because of carbon credits.\nRight now, Big Tech majors are the biggest clients of companies engaged in the generation of electricity from wind and solar installations, for which generation these companies also receive so-called carbon credits. They are free to sell these credits to companies that want to reduce their emission footprint accumulated from their use of hydrocarbon sources of electricity for lack of comparable non-hydrocarbon alternatives. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are big consumers of carbon credits. But if those reactors get built, demand for carbon credits will take a plunge\u2014and it will never return.\nThis is a problem for wind and solar generators because those carbon credits are an important source of income. That source of income could become even more important as negative prices due to overproduction become more frequent. Yet Big Tech with its nuclear plans could put an end to this lucrative carbon credit trade because nuclear generation is zero-emission generation.\nGranted, this will take years to happen. There will be challenges as small modular reactor technology proves itself in the field. There will be failures and delays. But with Big GTech\u2019s money and its very urgent need for energy, chances are that nuclear will be making a major comeback. In the meantime, gas and even coal are guaranteed some stable demand growth from the data center world.\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nHarbour Energy Joins North Sea Oil Exodus Ahead Of Tax Hikes\nGold Surges to New Highs Amidst 'Trump Trade' Momentum\nIs The West Prepared To Deal With Potential Iranian Sabotage Of The Oil Market?\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\nView Comments"

He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best FAANG Stock To Buy According to Analysts?\nImage by Tawanda Razika from Pixabay\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nAnalyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 16.5%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology giant that was originally not part of the FAANG stocks due to its mature business model. However, as the company ventured into new technologies and AI, it does represent a breakthrough stock that can influence the future.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is part of the list because of its strategic investments, positioning it as a leader in AI. On September 23, Gil Luria, D.A. Davidson\u2019s managing director, appeared on Yahoo Finance where he talked about MSFT\u2019s lead in the tech and AI business. He suggests that the company was involved with OpenAI for a long time, giving them a headstart. Additionally, the company knew ChatGPT was coming before anyone else. Similarly, a year and a half ago, the company launched commercial products related to artificial intelligence. However, he does acknowledge that Amazon and Google have been catching up to MSFT, slowly diminishing the lead.\nAs Luria highlighted, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has usually been the first to jump on crucial trends and identify market shifts. Similarly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was among the first mega-cap companies to pour capital into nuclear energy. On September 20, the company signed a deal to reopen Three Mile Island, the site of one of the worst nuclear accidents in the US, to power and advance its AI technologies.\nOn the AI front, the company closed deals with startups and technology companies to run their workloads on Microsoft Azure, its cloud platform. On October 10, the company revealed several breakthrough AI capabilities in healthcare that offer medical imaging, clinical records management, and genomics. Previously on October 3, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed a partnership with Rezolve AI to develop innovative AI-backed online retail solutions.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a long-standing company with immensely strong fundamentals. This coupled with its investments in AI and data make it one of the best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Last year, generative AI was the talk of the town at the annual HLTH conference in Vegas. It was a breakthrough the health tech industry folks needed and held the promise of everything from virtually diagnosing patients to conducting surgeries to finding disease cures.\nThis year, key industry players are adopting a more measured tone.\nTwo themes emerged at this year's HLTH, hosted at the Venetian Expo. The first is to help automate mundane tasks to avoid the \"crisis level\" of burnout. The second is slowing down the response time of AI and its underlying large language models (LLMs).\nThe latter is a concept being adopted by the tech industry at large, known as \"the reasoning phase.\" As Sequoia Capital said in a recent blog, \"It\u2019s not enough for [language] models to simply know things \u2014 they need to pause, evaluate and reason through decisions in real time.\"\nGary Lynch, Verizon's (VZ) global practice leader of healthcare and life sciences, noted the first theme: the need to solve existing problems.\n\"When you walk the [conference] floor, you see a lot of these new, interesting clinical applications. But we really have to help our hospital partners with the operational efficiencies or we're never going to get to remote surgeries,\" Lynch said.\nDoes AI mean less paperwork for doctors? (Getty Creative) \u00b7 Tom Werner via Getty Images\nCompanies such as Verizon and Nvidia (NVDA) are keys to the foundation that the technology needs to be built on, while companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) offer a base \u2014 like cloud computing and paid access to their AI tools \u2014 to create solutions that could revolutionize the industry. They all had a presence at HLTH this year and spoke to Yahoo Finance about the progress made in the industry.\nThe idea of automating tasks isn't new, but the technology is finally in a place where it is now a reality, experts told Yahoo Finance at the conference.\n\"Over the last year and a half, a lot of these new platforms ... all these capabilities didn't exist,\" said Umesh Rustogi, Microsoft health and life sciences data platform general manager.\nThe most prominent example is AI \u2014 or ambient\u2014 scribes, which listen to and transcribe patient visits and then identify relevant information, like reasons for the visit and what the doctor advised or prescribed, to add to a patient's electronic health record. (Companies like Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN) have launched these products in the past year, resulting, some experts say, in hours of physician time saved.)\nTampa General Hospital CEO John Couris said the scribes have helped improve the quality of patient visits while also helping reduce the burden on physicians after hours. \"They're working at 7, 8 o'clock at night, when they're at their kids' baseball game, or they're working at 11, 12, or 1 in the morning doing notes. That's not sustainable, it's not right,\" Couris said.\nStory Continues\nThere are other solutions on the horizon, according to Verizon's Lynch.\n\"I'll give you an example: asset tracking. A nurse spends an hour of his or her day just looking for stuff. So we're building a solution where a nurse can grab their phone and say, 'Where's the nearest wheelchair? Where's the nearest IV pump?'\" he said.\nThe ideal solution would be one that integrates into existing systems, rather than create more disparate systems \u2014 known as point solutions \u2014 for hospitals to install and track, Lynch said.\nThere is broad agreement that healthcare needs to be changed in major ways, said Greg Corrado, senior research director at Google AI.\nAI may finally be delivering on its promises to health care providers. (Getty Creative) \u00b7 JohnnyGreig via Getty Images\nBut it won't be easy, and no one company can do it. Instead it might take more collaboration between tech companies and hospitals.\n\"What matters most is that we don't work in this sector like 7-year-olds playing soccer... [where] everybody's on the ball, and they're missing the bigger opportunity,\" he said.\nThat being said, AI is finally fulfilling the promise of digital health for providers.\n\"AI is certainly still the big buzzword. Everyone's got AI in their booth,\" Verizon's Lynch said.\nBut it isn't going to be as simple as plug and play, Google's Corrado said.\n\"I don't think that it's going to work very well to just imagine that we can do everything the way that we've been doing it in medicine the last 50 years, and we're just going to add AI,\" he said.\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Microsoft Software Retail Boxes , Isolated, Windows 8 Pro,\nRadu Bercan / Shutterstock.com\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nKeyBanc\u2019s third-quarter 2024 survey of value-added resellers (VARs) has noted a rise in IT budget expectations.\nStory Continues\n\u201cFor 2024, IT budgets saw a slight growth in expectations, but the bigger shift was in 2025, where budgets are now expected to grow by 4.4%, up from 3.2% just 90 days ago,\u201d said KeyBanc analysts, led by Jackson Ader, in a detailed report to investors.\nBased on this survey, the firm gave bullish ratings to several stocks, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft\u2019s target was increased to $505 from $490.\nDA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company\u2019s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum. Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA\u2019s, according to Luria.\nFollowing a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft\u2019s dependence on NVIDIA. Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins. The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities.\nThe concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1.\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cGenerative AI\u2019s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called \u2018inference\u2019). Some of the latest trends worry us.\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category \u2013 nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google\u2019s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\u201cWe Are Just at the Beginning of the AI Buildout\u201d\nEach of the big tech stocks has revealed its plans to invest $50 to $100 billion in GPU compute, evidence that Artificial intelligence may be the biggest theme right now. On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) has recently closed crucial partnerships, added innovations to its Falcon Platform, and expanded its CrowdStrike Marketplace to meet the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions.\nDespite the July 19 incident, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been resilient and showcased transparency and accountability to its customers. However, the company must sustain its efforts towards making customers happy.\u00a0On August 28, Fatima Boolani, Citi US software equity research co-head, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss CRWD following the global outage.\u00a0She shares that CRWD management has a lot of tasks especially when it comes to rebuilding its trust among investors and managing the impact of their business impact. She adds that the company has an appetite and regaining consumer confidence should remain the primary focus. Boolani argued that since there is a lack of talent in cybersecurity, AI can potentially fill the gap, that CRWD is in the crosshairs of in a positive way.\nAs Boolani said, the market currently lacks talent in cybersecurity, giving CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) an edge and putting it ahead of its competitors. 69 hedge funds were bullish on the stock as of Q2 2024, according to our Insider Monkey database.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\"\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

By integrating AI-native endpoint security from the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae cybersecurity platform and Fortinet\u2019s FortiGate next-generation firewalls (NGFW), customers and partners gain the flexibility, visibility and security across networks, applications and endpoints to stop breaches.\nBest-of-Breed Device and Network Security\nThe speed and sophistication of modern threats requires a multi-layer approach to security, integrating cutting-edge technologies to mitigate risk across an expanding attack surface. With traditional tooling, security teams often face challenges such as limited visibility and delayed detection and response. The CrowdStrike and Fortinet partnership provides rich telemetry across endpoint and network, enabling fast and accurate AI-powered threat protection and response, while streamlining security operations with a single, unified view.\nThe Falcon platform revolutionized cybersecurity through an AI-native and adversary intelligence approach. Replacing antivirus and a host of other legacy point products has led to the market adopting the Falcon platform as the industry standard for endpoint security among other modules. Tested in multiple third-party assessments, the Falcon platform delivers industry-leading protection efficacy, enterprise scalability and deployment ease.\nFortinet\u2019s FortiGate NGFWs are available in multiple form factors, including hardware, software and as-a-Service. Fortinet\u2019s hardware utilizes proprietary purpose-built ASICs, yielding on average 17x faster firewall performance and are up to 90 percent more power efficient than the competition. The addition of Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard AI-powered Security Services offers organizations the highest threat-protection performance on the market today.\nThe seamless, bidirectional integration of CrowdStrike and Fortinet optimizes network and endpoint security, streamlines operations and accelerates detection and response to elusive threats across the entire enterprise environment. Customers and partners gain context-rich insights into network traffic, user activity and device posture, further strengthening their ability to mitigate security risks with consistent, real-time protection and responses against the latest and most sophisticated threats.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike and Fortinet are jointly committed to supporting a broad, adaptable and open cybersecurity ecosystem, providing customers and partners with the flexibility to build a tailored best-of-breed security strategy.\nTwo of the Industry\u2019s Most Validated Leaders Partner\n\"Two of cybersecurity's leading companies partnering, each with a world-class channel ecosystem, creates a powerful combination that benefits everyone involved,\" said Jay McBain, chief analyst at Canalys. \"The CrowdStrike and Fortinet partnership is a win for customers, who gain access to a multi-layer network and endpoint security, and a win for partners, who now have even greater opportunities to deliver value and drive growth.\"\nEarlier this year, CrowdStrike was named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP) for the fifth consecutive time.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Taiwan Semiconductor, Netflix, and Other Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's list.\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently expressed concern that some investors are overlooking potential market opportunities by fixating on the Federal Reserve's next moves regarding interest rates. He emphasized that, over the years, many in the investment community have become overly reliant on the Fed\u2019s actions rather than focusing on individual companies and their profitability.\n\u201cEveryone who\u2019s obsessed with the Fed\u2019s next foray is basically investing with blinders on, and as a result, they\u2019re missing out on some of the greatest moves I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Moves coming from the most unlikely of stocks. And I don't want to see you ignoring these opportunities anymore.\u201d\nCramer said that he is an admirer of Fed Chair Jay Powell, but he recognizes the limits of the Fed's influence. He noted that while Powell wields significant power, he cannot dictate the performance of high-quality companies that are less affected by economic cycles. According to Cramer, when a company is not tied to the business cycle, it is less susceptible to the whims of the Fed. However, many traders still seem oblivious to this reality.\n\u201c... I needed to say something because over the past couple of decades, so many people in this business have become creatures of the Fed, not of companies and the profits that they make. Unless the Fed's happy\u2026 unless it has its pound of flesh, these Fed watchers won't pull the trigger and buy stocks, even stocks of companies have almost nothing whatsoever to do with our central bank and are doing really well.\u201d\nHe highlighted that fear of the Fed often extends to stocks that appear pricey based on earnings multiples, particularly when investors worry that the Fed might have to abandon rate cuts to combat inflation. This fear, he noted, can drive investors away from promising sectors, like semiconductors. While Cramer acknowledges the importance of being aware of the Fed\u2019s actions, he insists that it should not become an obsession. He believes that although the Fed has considerable influence, it is not all-powerful.\nHe clarified that he does not claim the stock market will never decline during periods of Fed easing, but he maintains that there are limits to the Fed's impact.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying the stock market will never go down when the Fed\u2019s easing\u2026 I am saying there are limits to what the Fed impacts. And I swear by the managers who know a lot about business, and who don\u2019t cower when Jay Powell grabs the mic to talk about the pace of rate cuts.\u201d\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 17. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCramer recently mentioned that his Charitable Trust initiated a position in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) and said:\n\u201c... I chose technology and financials. The former, CrowdStrike, is a high flyer that sells for 85 times earnings. That's supposedly the kiss of death if you're worried about what you'll hear from the Fed heads when they come on television and speak at some austere civic organization\u2026\u201d\nCrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) offers cybersecurity solutions, serving clients both domestically and globally. The company\u2019s unified platform provides comprehensive, cloud-based protection for endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data. In July, a significant IT outage because of a glitch within its software led to considerable disruption across various sectors. However, the company\u2019s swift response played a crucial role in managing the situation.\nThe company took immediate responsibility and quickly rolled out a fix. The proactive approach demonstrated a commitment to maintaining the integrity of its software and prioritizing long-term reputation over short-term consequences.\nAt the Fal.Con conference in September, CEO George Kurtz highlighted CrowdStrike Holdings' (NASDAQ:CRWD) resilience in the wake of the incident. He reported a remarkable 98% gross spending retention rate. Furthermore, he noted that the company\u2019s pipeline generation had rebounded to levels seen prior to the outage, suggesting that the incident did not significantly hinder its business operations. Furthermore, the company\u2019s leadership has previously stated an ambitious target of reaching $10 billion in annual recurring revenue in a few years.\nOverall CRWD ranks 4th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other promising tech stocks.\nNASDAQ is Poised for Long-Term Returns\nBig tech is expected to outperform in the coming months. On October 2, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer's Head of Technical Analysis, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis and explain why investors must consider high-growth companies.\nWald highlights that market breadth is expected to remain high supporting extended highs throughout the end of 2024. In addition to that, he expects the bull cycle to remain intact and believes the trend will continue in 2025. During the late summer, the market saw a change in the high beta versus low volatility ratio stocks. It was seen that high-beta stocks could not keep up with high dividend-paying and lower-volatility names.\nGiven the rotational nature of the market, Wald expects higher beta names to make a strong comeback and reclaim their leadership position. Wald suggests that investors should consider investing in higher growth companies, as the Nasdaq and Russel 100 are expected to lead again. Trends show that the mag seven is growing and climbing, as the market conditions continue to settle.\nViewing Tech Stocks on Valuations Alone is Wrong, Strategist Says\nTechnology stocks have more room to run. On October 14, Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the technology market outlook and revealed his favorite picks.\nEthridge suggests that judging stocks based on their valuations alone is a big mistake, especially in the current market cycle which is heavily influenced by the AI boom. Looking at the broader perspective, he believes there are a lot of positive opportunities among the magnificent seven and outside of it.\nHe adds that companies among the mega tech have been pouring billions into generating large language models and the likes of it. He also suggests that most of this technology is yet to be understood and therefore the true value we can derive from these technologies is yet to come. These companies also have a lot of intrinsic value and there is more to be realized soon.\nNow that we have studied the technology market outlook, let's take a look at the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. You can also read our piece on the most promising AI stocks according to analysts.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising tech stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment as of Q2 2024.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that ranks 10th on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. The company provides a range of security products including identity management, threat intelligence, and threat detection.\nThe company has 29,000 clients in multiple sectors including healthcare, retail, technology, and the government, reflecting its strong position in the market. Its AI native cybersecurity platform, Falcon is its primary product, growing at 80% year-over-year, in FQ2 2025. Despite the July 19 incident, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been resilient and showcased transparency and accountability to its customers. In the past 40 days, the company closed crucial partnerships, added innovations to its Falcon Platform, and expanded its CrowdStrike Marketplace to meet the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions.\nOn August 29, Eric Heath, KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his stance on CRWD. He suggested that despite its global outage in July, the long-term opportunity CRWD offers remains intact. He also added that the company is taking corrective action to avoid such incidents in the future and suggested the company has grown since the incident and will continue to do so.\nAs our reliance on software increases so does the need for cybersecurity, which makes CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) an important stakeholder now and in the coming years. That said, according to our Insider Monkey database, 69 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the close of Q2 2024.\nOverall CRWD ranks 10th on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +11.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -12.9% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.1%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.26 indicates a change of +16.8% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CrowdStrike is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $982.24 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25%. The $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +27.5% and +22.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On October 1, Aniket Shah, Jefferies\u2019 global head of sustainability and transition strategy, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss his stance on nuclear energy making a comeback amid the AI boom.\nShah shares that the nuclear energy boom is not surprising. Looking back, the United States signed significant partnerships to boost the supply of nuclear energy years ago, indicating that the value this sector holds is not unknown or recent.\nHe adds that the big tech companies are going to be primary catalysts and will influence the entire market. These companies will invest millions and billions in nuclear energy, making the transition easier for other companies to follow. According to Shah, some key investment areas would be small modular reactors and nuclear fusion.\nShah also acknowledged that the United States held a bipartisan view of the nuclear boom, explaining why regulations and acts in favor of nuclear energy are being passed at notoriously high speeds. While the building blocks of nuclear energy are coming together, Shah remains concerned over the execution. He highlights that the United States does not have enough skilled labor and resources to make the nuclear energy boom a reality and must work extremely hard to make it happen.\nNuclear Energy is Poised for Growth Amid AI Boom\nOne of the most opportunistic investment themes in 2024 is AI, the other is electrification, and both require a lot of power. The surge in power demand is in turn driving utility stocks. On October 4, Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI managing director, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss how utilities could benefit from AI-driven power demand.\nChopra highlights the biggest catalyst for companies like Vistra and Constellation Energy is data centers\u2019 needs for a 24/7 source of clean energy. Therefore, nuclear companies must grab the opportunity and enter into long-term contracts to lock in future growth as soon as possible.\nThere are multiple projects in the pipeline in the United States, that add up to roughly 1.5 gigawatts of energy, positioning nuclear plants as the next big thing in energy. On the flip side, balancing supply and demand will be a key challenge for companies.\nStory Continues\nDespite the challenges, he believes that the market is well-positioned for growth in utilities. Utilities have not seen demand growth in the past decade, but things are finally changing for the sector. Overall, with inflation going down, the sector may experience significant tailwinds. Chopra also emphasized that growth in this sector will yield results in five to seven years.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for the next decade, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity.

Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nBroadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. The company expects about $12 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2024, which means 20% of its total revenue will come from AI and counting.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks with consistent growth to buy.\nCurrently, financial markets are experiencing a mix of optimism and caution as investors react to changing economic conditions. Many are closely watching trends and data that could impact future growth and stability.\nTom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently shared his insights on the current market trends during an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 14. He acknowledged that he underestimated the strength of the market, noting that it has been surprisingly resilient despite expectations of volatility leading up to the 2024 election. Lee highlighted that there is a significant amount of cash\u2014about $6 trillion\u2014sitting on the sidelines, which has contributed to the market\u2019s stability. He observed that many investors had anticipated a recession, but instead, companies have shown strong earnings and resilience.\nLee also mentioned that the Federal Reserve is likely to adopt a supportive stance as inflation data continues to trend toward their 2% target. He believes that regardless of who wins the upcoming election, stocks are likely to perform well in the following year. Lee pointed out that markets tend to thrive on visibility and certainty, suggesting that if one candidate appears to be gaining an advantage, it could lead to a more favorable trading environment before the election. Overall, he remains optimistic about the market\u2019s outlook.\nS&P 500 and Dow Reach New Heights Ahead of Election Season\nOn October 18, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached new record highs, marking six consecutive weeks of gains for these major indices. As reported by CNBC, the S&P 500 rose by 0.40%, closing at 5,864.67, while the Dow rose by 0.09% and added 36.86 points to close at 43,275.91. The Nasdaq also performed well, increasing 0.63% to close at 18,489.55. This marks the longest winning streak of the year for both the Dow and S&P 500, with notable increases in their overall performance.\nAs earnings season progresses, over 70 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their results, with about 75% of those companies surpassing expectations. Despite potential market volatility leading up to the upcoming election, some analysts believe that stocks may continue to rise through November.\nRob Williams, a chief investment strategist at Sage Advisory, noted that this trend is unusual for an election year, where markets typically hesitate before improving post-election. He suggested that investors might be optimistic about a possible victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose policies are seen as more favorable for businesses in terms of regulations and taxes.\nStory Continues\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 30 stocks.\nNext, we focused on identifying stocks that had demonstrated consistent growth. From the initial list, we narrowed our choices to stocks that have grown their revenue positively over the past 5 years. We further refined our selection to include only those that had positive revenue growth each year in their last five reported annual revenues.\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the revenue CAGR over the past five years, and Macrotrends, which offered information on historical annual revenue data. Finally, we have ranked the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy below in ascending order based on their five-year revenue CAGR.\nAdditionally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds as of Q2 of 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company\u2019s focus on urban, commuter-friendly developments positions it well to capture long-term growth in the Washington D.C. market.\n\nComstock's asset-light, debt-free model, combined with access to a $10 million credit facility, provides ample financial flexibility for future developments. Its diversified tenant base and strong occupancy rates reduce vacancy risk. However, the company faces concentration risk with heavy reliance on key developments. A structural shift toward remote work also poses challenges to its office leasing performance.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Comstock here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Roche Holding AG (RHHBY), American Express Co.

This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.18% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.8%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.27%.\nShares of the chipmaker witnessed a gain of 5.14% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 6.6% and outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 4.46%.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Broadcom Inc. in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.39, reflecting a 25.23% increase from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $14.06 billion, indicating a 51.29% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nAVGO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.82 per share and revenue of $51.58 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.95% and +44.01%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Broadcom Inc. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.12% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Currently, Broadcom Inc. is carrying a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nInvestors should also note Broadcom Inc.'s current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 37.29. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 34.31, which means Broadcom Inc. is trading at a premium to the group.\nAlso, we should mention that AVGO has a PEG ratio of 2.27. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Electronics - Semiconductors industry was having an average PEG ratio of 3.81.\nStory Continues\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 100, placing it within the top 40% of over 250 industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nEnsure to harness Zacks.com to stay updated with all these stock-shifting metrics, among others, in the next trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nPositive sentiment is prevailing in the market after strong bank earnings and increasing hopes of a soft landing. Ryan Detrick, Carson Group chief market strategist, said while talking during a recent program on CNBC that he sees more runway for the current bull market.\n\u201cThis is a bull market. Now we\u2019re in the third year of a bull market. My friend Sam Stovall said once you get to 65 years old, the odds of getting to 85 are really, really high. Bull markets work that way. Going back 50 years, there\u2019s five other bull markets that made it into their third year, like this one is right now. The worst any of them went was another three years. A five-year total. The average was eight years. I\u2019m not saying we have another six years of a bull market but what we\u2019re saying is this is an economy that keeps surprising to the upside.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nHowever, the analyst said large-cap tech stocks are \u201cpricey.\u201d He believes small- and mid-cap stocks are cheap and labeled financials and industrials as fairly valued.\nThere are some top AI stocks that are seeing insider selling activity. In this article, we take a look at those stocks and analyze their fundamentals and market sentiment. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAre Insiders Selling Broadcom (AVGO) Amid Recent Stock Decline?\nelectronics-6055226_1280\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nOn September 24, 2024, Broadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0President and CEO Hock E. Tan\u00a0sold\u00a0150,000 shares at $172.94 per share, reducing his ownership by 10% to 1,289,440 shares. The sale was valued at approximately $25.94 million. The stock is down 3.3% since this transaction.\nOn September 19, 2024, Broadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0President of the Semiconductor Solutions Group Charlie B. Kawwas sold 25,200 shares at $168.27 per share, reducing his ownership by 3% to 838,470 shares. The transaction was valued at approximately $4.24 million.\nIn its last reported results, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) beat estimates on both EPS and revenue, but guidance failed to impress the Street, resulting in a share price decline. However, Jefferies said the dip was a buying opportunity.\nStory Continues\n\u201cGuidance came in a bit lighter than expected, but management has been messaging lumpiness in AI revenue and growth is set to reaccelerate in 4Q,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis, in a note. \u201cThe cyclical correction in non-AI revenue is in-line with peers, and our view is the long-term trend in AI still favors an industry shift to custom ASICs, where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) remains well-positioned. Factor in the added benefit of the VMware acquisition running ahead of schedule on both revenue and earnings, and it\u2019s easy to look past one minor bump in the road.\u201d\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. The company expects about $12 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2024, which means 20% of its total revenue will come from AI and counting.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nColumbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\nBroadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) also performed well during the quarter, as the company reported better-than-expected earnings, with upside from demand related to AI. This long-term holding is strongly positioned to benefit from continued AI demand, with AI sales in the quarter up 400% over the prior year. Overall, AI-related revenue accounted for 30% of total revenue in 2024 and is on pace to represent a majority of the company\u2019s revenue within two to three years.\nOverall, AVGO ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Insiders are Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Should you buy the semiconductor stocks right now or is it too late to get in?\nSemiconductors: Too Hot to Handle?\nThe semiconductor stocks, which includes more than just the chips, have been on a tear the last 18 months. Over the summer, the stocks took a break and fell back. But some, like NVIDIA, are now back at all-time highs.\nThis earnings season may push them even higher.\nTracey looked at 5 of the biggest names in the industry.\nAre they too expensive to buy right now or is the growth just so strong you MUST own them?\n5 Semiconductor Stocks: Should You Buy Them Now?\n1. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\nNVIDIA has been a top stock all year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 184.2% year-to-date, easily outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 23%. But it\u2019s been rocky the past 3 months, with big sell-offs. However, thanks to a surge in October, NVIDIA shares are up 15% over that time while the S&P 500 is up just 4.2%.\nEarnings look spectacular. Earnings are expected to rise 116% in fiscal 2025 and another 32.8% in fiscal 2026.\nWhile NVIDIA may seem expensive with a forward P/E of 48, it has a PEG ratio of just 1.16. A PEG under 1.0 indicates a company has both value and growth. NVIDIA\u2019s PEG is nearly that low.\nShould investors still buy NVIDIA right now?\n2. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD\nAdvanced Micro Devices has lagged in 2024. While shares of Advanced Micro Devices are up 48.6% over the last year, year-to-date they\u2019re up just 12.8%. Over the last 3 months, Advanced Micro Devices is down 4.9% while the S&P 500 is up 4.2%.\nEarnings are expected to jump 26.8% in 2024 and another 54.6% in 2025. You won\u2019t get Advanced Micro Devices cheaply, though. It trades with a forward P/E of 46. However, it\u2019s PEG ratio is just 1.6, which is low.\nStory Continues\nIs this a buying opportunity in Advanced Micro Devices?\n3. Broadcom Inc. AVGO\nBroadcom shares have been testing new all-time highs again in 2024. Broadcom is up 67.3% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 23.3%. Over the last 3 months, it is outperforming as well, up 13.4% compared to 4.2% for the S&P 500.\nEarnings are expected to rise 14% in fiscal 2024 and another 27% in fiscal 2025. Broadcom\u2019s P/E is a little more reasonable, at 36.7x. It has a PEG ratio of 2.2, however. That\u2019s higher than NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices.\nShould Broadcom be on your short list?\n4. Lam Research Corp. LRCX\nLam Research is the only one of these 5 stocks that is underperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date. Shares of Lam Research are down 2.4% year-to-date. Over the last 3 months, the performance has been dismal. Shares are down 26.7% during that time.\nYet earnings are expected to rise 8.7% in fiscal 2025 and another 32.6% in fiscal 2026. Lam Research has attractive valuations with a forward P/E of just 22.8 and a PEG ratio of 1.69.\nIs this share weakness a buying opportunity in Lam Research?\n5. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM\nTaiwan Semiconductor just reported earnings and beat again. It also sees strong demand for AI chips for the next several years.\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor have spiked on the earnings news and are up 19.1% over the last 3 months. However, they have been on the move higher all year and are now up 102.7% year-to-date.\nEarnings are expected to rise 24.5% in 2024 and another 28.4% in 2025. Remarkably, the stock is still cheap even with the huge move higher in the shares. Taiwan Semiconductor trades with a forward P/E of 29.1 but a PEG of just 1.1.\nShould Taiwan Semiconductor be on your short list?\nWhat else do you need to know about the semiconductor stocks?\nTune into this week\u2019s video podcast to find out.\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AVGO in Zacks Insider Trader portfolio.]\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other profitable stocks.\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 14,\u00a0Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop.\nHe also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market.\nRegarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform.\nTom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data.\nLee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction.\nRegarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins.\nStory Continues\nWhile some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Our list is sorted in ascending order of the 10-year net income growth rates.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 smallcap and largecap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n10-Year Net Income CAGR: 32.74%\nTTM Net Income: $5.09 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company produces chips for networking, broadband, enterprise storage, and wireless communication for industries such as telecommunications, and data centers.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for AI semiconductors.

The company\u2019s AI-specific chip designs are customized to meet the unique workload demands of hyperscale cloud providers, allowing the company to cater to their precise specifications.\nBroadcom\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) acquisition of VMware, in late 2023, has significantly boosted its infrastructure software revenue, with a 200% year-over-year increase, contributing $3.8 billion from VMware in Q3. The integration of VMware has driven a 32% quarter-on-quarter increase in the annualized booking value for VMware Cloud Foundation.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is well-positioned to lead the AI semiconductor market, with AI contributing a growing share of its revenues. The company is expected to grow its earnings by 13.27% this year, and its leadership in AI-specific semiconductors, custom chip designs, and strong position within the AI ecosystem solidify its role as a key industry player, driving long-term growth and market leadership.\nOverall AVGO ranks 6th on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other IoT stocks.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network connecting physical objects to the internet. Industries are embracing IoT technologies for applications like smart manufacturing and supply chain management. Enterprise IoT spending is expected to slow down in the second half of this year due to economic concerns which will affect corporate spending in general. However, corporate spending on IoT will rebound in 2025. The global market for IoT is expected to grow at a rate of 24.3% annually between 2024 and 2032. In 2032, it is expected to reach a value of $4,062.34 billion.\nThe rise of smart homes, buildings, and manufacturing, along with advancements in smart infrastructure, is driving significant growth in the IoT market. Moreover, smart city initiatives are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing population and expansion of cities. Consumers are adopting smart city solutions, including smart utility meters, transportation, waste management, grids, and air quality controllers.\nIoT adoption is also growing rapidly in other sectors, particularly healthcare. The global IoT in healthcare market is projected to expand significantly and reach $952.3 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%. IoT is a major force behind healthcare's digital transformation, revolutionizing the way medical data is collected, analyzed, and used. This is leading to better patient care, greater operational efficiencies, and innovative treatments.\nIoT is also seeing increased adoption in warehouse management. The global IoT warehouse management market is projected to grow from $14.8 billion in 2023 to $57.2 billion by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 14.5% over the next decade. This growth is driven by the need for better inventory management, increased automation, and improved operational efficiency in logistics and supply chain operations.\nRead Also: 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy\nIn terms of market segmentation by technologies, WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular IoT make up 80% of the global IoT market. Wi-Fi accounts for 31% of all IoT connections. On the other hand, Bluetooth is used by 25% of connected IoT devices, and cellular IoT, including 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, accounts for nearly 21% of global IoT connections.\nA key trend in the IoT market for 2024 is the integration of AI technologies, including generative AI and edge AI, into IoT devices. Edge AI, in particular, is transforming the IoT landscape. By allowing IoT devices to process and store data locally, edge AI reduces lag and allows real-time responses. Incorporating AI into IoT devices within industries offers numerous benefits, including improved operational efficiency, safety, and decision-making. It plays an important role in predictive maintenance and supply chain management.\nStory Continues\nThe future of IoT looks promising. Businesses and investors can expect significant returns as the technology continues to evolve. Keeping this context in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the best IoT stocks to buy now.\nOur Methodology\nTo create our list of the 10 best IoT stocks to buy, we focused on companies that offer IoT solutions or products, including firms involved in manufacturing IoT devices and hardware. The companies have been shortlisted based on hedge fund sentiment, sourced from our database of over 900 hedge funds. The best IoT stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wired and wireless communication solutions including IoT applications. The company offers a wide range of system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions that enable voice, video, data, and multimedia connectivity in various environments, including homes, offices, and mobile devices. It also offers solutions for end-to-end monitoring across the IoT ecosystem which includes gateways, APIs, networks, apps, & infrastructures.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported strong Q3 FY2024 results with revenue up 47% to $13.1 billion, driven by AI semiconductor solutions and VMware. Meanwhile, EBITDA increased 42% to $8.2 billion. The company expects Q4 FY2024 revenue of $14 billion and EBITDA margin of 64%.\nWith the company's solid position in the growing tech sector and its diverse range of products, analysts see Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as one of the best IoT stocks to buy. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has received an average Buy rating.\nHere\u2019s what Baron Funds said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 6th on our list of the best IoT stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other promising tech stocks.\nNASDAQ is Poised for Long-Term Returns\nBig tech is expected to outperform in the coming months. On October 2, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer's Head of Technical Analysis, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis and explain why investors must consider high-growth companies.\nWald highlights that market breadth is expected to remain high supporting extended highs throughout the end of 2024. In addition to that, he expects the bull cycle to remain intact and believes the trend will continue in 2025. During the late summer, the market saw a change in the high beta versus low volatility ratio stocks. It was seen that high-beta stocks could not keep up with high dividend-paying and lower-volatility names.\nGiven the rotational nature of the market, Wald expects higher beta names to make a strong comeback and reclaim their leadership position. Wald suggests that investors should consider investing in higher growth companies, as the Nasdaq and Russel 100 are expected to lead again. Trends show that the mag seven is growing and climbing, as the market conditions continue to settle.\nViewing Tech Stocks on Valuations Alone is Wrong, Strategist Says\nTechnology stocks have more room to run. On October 14, Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the technology market outlook and revealed his favorite picks.\nEthridge suggests that judging stocks based on their valuations alone is a big mistake, especially in the current market cycle which is heavily influenced by the AI boom. Looking at the broader perspective, he believes there are a lot of positive opportunities among the magnificent seven and outside of it.\nHe adds that companies among the mega tech have been pouring billions into generating large language models and the likes of it. He also suggests that most of this technology is yet to be understood and therefore the true value we can derive from these technologies is yet to come. These companies also have a lot of intrinsic value and there is more to be realized soon.\nNow that we have studied the technology market outlook, let's take a look at the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. You can also read our piece on the most promising AI stocks according to analysts.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising tech stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment as of Q2 2024.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks fifth on our list of the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds. The semiconductor company designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor software infrastructure products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters.\nThis year, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) launched two breakthrough technologies for artificial intelligence infrastructure, the industry's first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. Previously in August, the company launched Rally Anywhere, an on-premise version of its enterprise agility platform, that will allow businesses to plan, prioritize, manage, and track activities at every level in the organization.\nOn September 6, Daniel Newman, Futurum Group CEO appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he talked about AVGO's position in the AI race. He shares that the company's AI business is performing well and AVGO owns the technology to solve some complicated networking use cases. Newman shares that AVGO is priced well and has the conditions to rotate back over the next few quarters,\nOverall, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is leading the race for AI infrastructure and holds promise for the future. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion.\nOverall AVGO ranks 5th on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks with lowest short interest to buy.\nA report from S3 Partners revealed that the rally in Chinese stocks as a result of stimulus measures cost traders who were betting against the US-listed shares ~$6.9 billion in mark-to-market losses. Benchmark CSI 300 index saw an increase of more than ~22% over the past month. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon index went up by over ~34% during the same period. Much of these increases were seen off the back of policy-easing measures.\nS3 Partners went on to say that, before this market rally, short sellers continued to build their positions profitably in the falling market. However, after the rebound, the short selling in the group slowed. Before China announced the stimulus plans, shorting the Chinese stocks was a popular strategy, with several market players going underweight in the sector.\nShort Selling in Q2 2024\nS3 Partners reported that short interest in the US/Canada markets went up by $57.9 billion, or 5.1%, to $1.20 trillion in Q2 2024. The increase comprised $73.9 billion of new short selling, which was partially offset by a\u00a0$16.0 billion fall in the mark-to-market value of shares shorted.\u00a0During the quarter, the sectors that saw the largest increase in short selling were the IT, Industrials, and Communication Services sectors. On the other hand, the Energy sector was the only sector that saw a decrease in shares shorted (short covering).\nShort Sellers Reduced Their Positions in This Sector\nS&P Global reported that short sellers decided to pull back their bets against consumer staples stocks on the US exchanges during the summer months. This comes amidst the general increase in overall short interest throughout equities. Recent data suggests that the short interest in the consumer staples sector declined to 3.87% at the end of August from 4.16% at the end of May. The decline in short interest against consumer staples stocks might be due to the decline in inflation.\nOn the other hand, short interest in the industrial sector went up by 21 bps from the end of May to the end of August, rose 20 basis points in the healthcare sector, and jumped 19 basis points in the real estate sector, as per the company. With the expectations of further rate cuts, market experts opine that the consumer staples sector might see sustained demand. The consumer spending resulted in solid Q2 2024 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 3% (annualized), approximately double the rate of Q1 growth, as per the US Bank.\nStory Continues\nAfter the rate cut in September, market strategists recommended going long on consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. This is because these sectors are expected to\u00a0receive a boost as declining mortgage rates might benefit spending, reported Reuters.\nTherefore, with the expectations of lower inflation and interest rates, there can be some revival in consumer confidence. This should result in increased spending on staple goods, which might lead to improved performance in the consumer staple sector. As per Evercore, among the S&P 500 sectors, consumer staples and consumer discretionary have seen the best average performance, with both sectors gaining ~14% a year after the rate cut.\nOur Methodology\nTo list 8 Stocks with Lowest Short Interest to Buy, we used a Finviz screener to extract the list of stocks having the\u00a0lowest short interest. Next, we narrowed down our list to the following 8 stocks having short interest of less than 2%. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the descending of their short interest.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been tagged as a key player in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution because it continues to leverage its expertise in custom silicon and networking solutions in a bid to capture a\u00a0significant share of the rapidly expanding market.\u00a0The company\u2019s focus on AI should act as a primary driver of its growth strategy.\u00a0Moving forward, its fundamentals are expected to be supported by strong demand for its AI accelerators and Ethernet solutions.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s success in AI should continue to be aided by its ability to secure and expand relationships with major tech giants. \u00a0In AI custom compute, the company is engaged in designing custom accelerators for large consumer-internet AI companies (like Google and Meta), who are developing large AI clusters in order to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s capability to quickly develop and bring to production custom solutions for well-established technology companies exhibits technological leadership and agility. Piper Sandler raised its target price on the shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) from $165.00 to $200.00, giving an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on 13th June.\nClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its third-quarter 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of the stocks with lowest short interest to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nS&P 500 to Reach 6,000 by Year-End Amid AI Boom and Earnings Growth\nJoining CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December.\nAs of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates.\nS&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors.\nArtificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nStrategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAt the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market\u2019s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI.\n\"We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,\u201d the note states. \u201cHowever, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure.\"\nAccording to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories.\nIt is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to \u201cbeat and raise\u201d expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology leader that develops, manufactures, and globally supplies a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. The company has had a strong FQ3 2024. It reported revenues rising 47% to $13.1 billion, fueled by strong demand for AI semiconductor solutions and VMware.\nOn October 14, 2024, Mizuho Securities adjusted its outlook for Broadcom Limited (NASDAQ:AVGO). It raised its price target to $220 from the previous $190 while maintaining an Outperform rating. Analysts at Mizuho have revised their price target upwards on the back of the company\u2019s potential revenue from its collaboration with OpenAI on custom AI chips.\nMizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh believes that the company\u2019s current stock price isn\u2019t fully reflective of its AI potential. In particular, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s silicon business, which includes application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), enables customers to develop specialized solutions tailored to their needs. The analysis reveals that the partnership could potentially unlock more than $16 billion opportunity for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). In addition, the ASIC market is expected to exceed $56 billion in the coming years, which makes it a large opportunity.\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nIf you've ever watched a horse race, you know how exciting it is to see a dark horse beat one of the prerace favorites to finish in the money. Much of the excitement is wrapped up in realizing how much money smart bets on the surprise horse will pay. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) stockholders probably feel the same sensation because the company just knocked Tesla out of the S&P 500 Magnificent Seven.\nThe S&P 500 Magnificent Seven is a group of seven tech giants with the highest value in terms of market cap. Magnificent Seven members usually also have a significant market share in their sector. The combined performance of these stocks is seen by many as an indicator of how well the tech sector is performing writ large. Since tech has become such a powerful economic driver, being a Magnificent Seven member has tremendous cache.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\nThis is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\nPowell\u2019s moves don\u2019t have to doom your high yields. You can still make great returns in private credit. Find out how.\nCompanies wear the Magnificent Seven as a badge of honor, elevating their visibility with investors. All these things generally positively affect share value, which is why it's always a big deal whenever a new member joins the club. Broadcom, which produces hardware and software for the computer industry, has benefited from AI's emergence and surged in value.\nAccording to a recent article in Fortune, Broadcom's market cap hit $803 billion in early October, putting it just above Tesla's valuation (at the time) of $786 billion. Since then, Broadcom's market cap has surged to nearly $820 billion, largely on the strength of Broadcom's bustling business selling AI chips, which Fortune estimates will go from $12.1 billion this year to $16.9 billion next year.\nTrending: Investing in private credit can outperform publicly-traded REITs, and you only need $100 to get started.\nBroadcom stock was trading at around $88 in mid-October of last year, but it surged to $175.98 and it's even paying a 1.16% dividend yield. By contrast, Tesla's (Nasdaq: TSLA) current market cap has fallen to approximately $699 billion, putting it further behind Broadcom\u2019s spot in the Magnificent Seven. So, does this mean you should load up on Broadcom and dump Tesla?\nStory Continues\nThe answer to that question depends on many different variables, chief among them your investment goals and strategy. Owning shares of a Magnificent Seven stock can be lucrative, but it's no guarantee of wealth or performance. Additionally, Magnificent Seven membership is not permanent. Elon Musk is always prone to develop an innovation that drives Tesla's market cap past $1 trillion.\nIt's also always possible for a company that no one expected, like Broadcom, to catch fire and become an even newer addition to the Magnificent Seven. Investing in Magnificent Seven stocks can certainly be a winning strategy, but so can thinking outside the box and looking for companies positioned to become new members. An even wiser play might be diversifying your portfolio by purchasing shares in Mag Seven members and potential new entries.\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\nArrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform, offers a Private Credit Fund. This fund provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target of 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand. The defense logistics agency works with ServiceNow assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project. Bangkok de Brazil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation.\nThe Veterans Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the Veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI powered solutions to improve its colleague experience.\nAfter rolling out now assist globally, EY works with ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks to deliver faster resolutions for enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life saving mission.\nMercedes Benz work to its ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

Overall, this was a strong quarter.\nIs now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million.\nAlso, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 39.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $959.64 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,034.\nStory Continues\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Current remaining performance obligation, a measure of booked sales, increased 26% in the period ending Sept. 30. Both exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company makes applications that help companies organize and automate their personnel and information technology operations. Like its peers, ServiceNow is baking generative AI features into its products and offers a pricier tier with those tools.\nThe company\u2019s main generative AI assistant product, Now Assist, is the fastest-growing in company history, Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott said in an interview. The average contract premium for users of Now Assist is 30%, he added.\nThe shares hit a record high Thursday in New York, jumping about 6%. Investors were initially unimpressed with the results, with the stock trading down Wednesday evening. The shares had increased 28% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close. That\u2019s more than twice the rally seen in the iShares Expanded Software ETF, which is often used as a sector benchmark.\nThe results \u201cvalidate the company\u2019s rare standing in enterprise software,\u201d wrote Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup. He cited strong execution in a tough environment for tech spending and early monetization of generative AI.\nIn recent weeks, ServiceNow and software peers like Salesforce Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have begun emphasizing AI \u201cagents\u201d that can complete tasks without user supervision. Some customers are already trying ServiceNow\u2019s agents, which will be released more broadly next month, McDermott said. Once the agents are fully rolled out, they\u2019ll be priced differently from other products, McDermott added.\nFor the current quarter ending in December, ServiceNow projected subscription revenue of about $2.88 billion, just ahead of analyst estimates. The company expects near-term bookings to rise 21.5%.\nThis bookings guidance was effectively \u201cgood, but not great,\u201d Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note. He added that the company tends to issue conservative forecasts for the fourth quarter.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also announced the hiring of a leader from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Cloud for a prominent role. Amit Zavery will fill titles vacated earlier this year by CJ Desai as president, chief product officer and chief operating officer. Zavery will focus on product and engineering, McDermott said. His first-year compensation is targeted at about $2 million, with a $3 million signing bonus, according to a filing.\nDesai left the company in July after a complaint about a government contract and the hiring of a former US Army technology leader.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 97\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0April 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cUS-based software company,ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW), provided another strong result, continuing its long and consistent track record of 20%-plus revenue growth combined with healthy profitability. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year to $2.5 billion and free cash flow grew 47% year-on-year to $1.2 billion. The company\u2019s core operating metrics were also impressive with remaining performance obligations growing 26% year-on-year to $17.7 billion (i.e. roughly 2x 2023 revenue) and renewal rates holding steady at 98%. Performance was evenly spread across segments, products, and geographies, with notable strength in the US federal government. The company now boasts 1,933 customers generating in excess of $1 million in Annual Contract Value (ACV), which is pleasing to see as it implies multiple solutions are involved and that the company\u2019s platform model is increasingly resonating with customers. In our view, ServiceNow is one the highest quality software businesses globally as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it a compelling opportunity.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Touting the feature as \u201cthe new apps,\u201d Microsoft hailed its ability to simplify enterprise tasks, saying initial pilots showed a 90% reduction in lead times and a 30% reduction in administrative work.\n\u2022 USD\n(CRM)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n\u201cThe impact of this is tremendous,\u201d said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, speaking in London. He added, \u201cWe now have at-scale evidence of how these tools are fundamentally changing, \u2026 increasing value, and reducing waste.\u201d\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at the company's annual conference for software developers on May 6, 2019, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe announcement came just weeks after Salesforce announced the buildout of its own autonomous agents through the Agentforce platform, underscoring the AI-driven opportunity companies see in enterprise.\nHailed by Salesforce as the third wave in the AI revolution, customized agents enable companies to move beyond traditional chatbots that answer to preprogrammed responses to digital assistants that can reason, tackle multiple tasks at the same time, and make judgments based on a broader set of data.\nSalesforce AI CEO Clara Shih said the use cases are especially abundant in customer relations management, where agents can handle everything from product returns to crafting sales pitches.\n\u201cIt goes from being a single step prescribing, almost micromanaging what the AI should do versus asking the agent to figure out what it needs to do,\u201d said Shih in an interview with Yahoo Finance (video above).\nMicrosoft, Salesforce tout digital assistants as the future\nOther companies have touted their own specialized use cases for AI agents.\nCloud software provider ServiceNow (NOW) has announced plans to integrate AI agents into its human resources and IT platform. Dating app Grindr is working on an AI agent wingman that would seek out relationship prospects and help set up dates. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) helps clients develop their own agents for internal use, including legal work.\nAnd in a recent podcast interview, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang envisioned a future where 100 million AI agents would be deployed within the company.\n\u201cOur inbox is going to be full of directories of AIs that we work with,\u201d he said. \u201cAIs will recruit other AIs to solve problems. AIs will be in Slack channels with each other and with humans.\u201d\nStory Continues\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks onstage with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff during Salesforce's Dreamforce on Sept. 17, 2024, in San Francisco, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \u00b7 Justin Sullivan via Getty Images\nHowever, the battle over autonomous agents has pit Salesforce and Microsoft against each other in particular, in part because the companies have clashed publicly but also because of the trove of enterprise data both have access to. CEO Marc Benioff has repeatedly likened Microsoft\u2019s Copilot to Clippy, its doomed Office assistant from the 1990s, once listed as one of Time\u2019s 50 worst inventions.\nAt its Dreamforce event last month, Shih doubled down on the criticism, without naming Microsoft directly, while touting the Agentforce platform.\n\u201cThis is the difference between a DIY science project versus a real enterprise-grade agent you can confidently deploy into production,\u201d Shih said. She added that Salesforce agents showed 33% greater accuracy and \u201ctwo times greater relevance\u201d than competitors, according to customer benchmarks.\nEarlier this week, Microsoft said agent deployment in companies like McKinsey & Company and UK-based Pets at Home have already been shown to cut down on time spent processing time-consuming work, including data entry.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nWith the wider release of Agentforce set for Oct. 29, Shih emphasized that these agents are not meant to replace human workers but assist them so that \u201chumans can start at higher level.\u201d\nShih expects Salesforce\u2019s advantage to grow as the battle for digital assistants heats up because of its ability to connect individual clients\u2019 data through Data Cloud and the safety layers in place for Agentforce.\nShe said human interaction with digital assistants will \u201cgrow exponentially.\u201d\n\u201cI think it's similar to asking the question maybe in 1998 of, in the future, how many other interactions will be through the internet or some sort of digital medium,\u201d Shih said. \u201cI very much believe that agents will play that role in the future. Agents will become the apps that all of us interface with.\u201d\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"
