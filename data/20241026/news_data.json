          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about.\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech.\nCramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted.\n\u201c... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.\u201d\nCramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day\u2019s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn\u2019t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts.\n\u201cSee, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.\u201d\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\nHe addressed the \u201calleged earnings disappointment,\u201d clarifying that he chose the term \u201calleged\u201d because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts.\nStory Continues\nHe reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment.\nConcluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked:\n\u201cBut the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nDiscussing Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Cramer remarked on its products and advertising business. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\u201cRates don't matter all that much to Microsoft or Meta or Google. Neither they nor their clients need to borrow large sums of money so the bond markets are irrelevant to them\u2026 You go to Meta, which also has an amazing balance sheet and extraordinary demand for its products. Their AI Ray-Bans are a huge hit, but that's barely a drop in the ocean because they can make so much money from the targeted advertising business and they will.\u201d\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a prominent technology company dedicated to creating products that enable users to connect and share across various devices. The company's financial performance has been strong, largely fueled by the ongoing transition to digital advertising. As the global digital advertising market is projected to grow from $366 billion in 2022 to over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to take advantage of this significant expansion.\nUser growth has played a crucial role in its success. In the second quarter, the number of individuals engaging with Meta\u2019s suite of social media platforms increased by 7%, reaching 3.27 billion and the ad revenue reached a whopping $38.3 billion.\nAdditionally, Meta (NASDAQ:META) is advancing its AI initiatives, currently with the development of Llama 4. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has indicated that this upcoming model could set a new standard for the industry when it launches next year. The company is also working to deploy 600,000 GPUs by the end of 2024, which shows a commitment to its long-term AI goals. The company has a strong balance sheet as it reported cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $58.08 billion, alongside a free cash flow of $10.90 billion, as of June 30.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Mark Zuckerberg and Meta are carving out a somewhat unique path in the artificial intelligence arms race by going all in open-source AI. Wall Street has fallen in love with Meta\u2019s winning combination of AI growth, powered by its strong balance sheet, and the steady expansion of its core businesses\u201441 of the 48 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are \u201cStrong Buys.\u201d\nMeta shares have surged 60% YTD and 345% in the last two years as part of a market and Tech sector-crushing run over the last decade.

Yet, Amazon stock\u2019s 25% YTD climb lags far behind Meta and other mega-cap technology stocks. AMZN is only up 130% off its lows and it failed to break out meaningfully above its 2021 peaks back in July.\nAmazon trades 21% below its average Zacks price target and it appears to be finding support around its 21-week moving average and its pervious highs. Amazon stock looks ready to possibly break out of its recent holding pattern if it is able to provide upbeat guidance.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOn the valuation front, Amazon trades 95% below its highs and at over a 50% discount to its 10-year median at 32.9X forward 12-month earnings.

On top of that, Amazon runs the world\u2019s largest cloud-computing business and its digital advertising segment is surging.\nThe strength of its higher-margin AWS and ad segments, along with a commitment to efficiency, are driving\u00a0Amazon's\u00a0earnings growth.

          "whole_article": "Next week, three of the biggest names in tech are set to report earnings, and investors will be watching closely. Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL) remain stalwarts of this market, and their quarterly earning reports not only affect their stock prices but also the broader market.\nDuring this year we have seen an interesting divergence in performance among these stocks, although even the worst performer, Alphabet, has still put up a decent return. Meta Platforms has been the clear outperformer year-to-date (YTD) more than tripling the returns of the others and Apple has slightly underperformed the market.\nThe near-term outlooks for these companies are also varied, although frankly, their business supremacy is still evident, and the long-term outlooks are still very bright in my opinion. Let\u2019s dive deeper into the details below.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta Platforms: Strong Outlook for the Stock\nMeta Platforms has been one of the best performing stocks in the market since the 2022 bear market. In terms of large cap stocks, only Nvidia has been better. Over the last two years META stock has rallied an incredible 346%. But that strong performance shouldn\u2019t shake investors\u2019 confidence, because it seems likely that the stock will continue to perform well.\nMETA enjoys numerous bullish catalysts that should make the stock a must watch. Currently, it enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.83%. Earnings are forecast to grow at an impressive 19.15% annually over the next three to five years, while the company also has a reasonable valuation of 26.5x forward earnings, just above the market average.\nLooking at META\u2019s stock chart, I also see a compelling technical setup. We can see just a few weeks ago the stock broke out from a clear bull flag, which sent it to new record highs. Today, there is a very similar pattern building. If the stock can break out above the $580 level, it should send it again to new highs. However, the market may wait until the earnings report to make the move.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nAlphabet: Cheapest Stock Among the Group\nAlthough Alphabet stock has struggled this year when compared to Apple, Meta and the broad market, it remains one of the premier assets in the market. Its entrenched business model and growth catalysts, combined with a relatively cheap valuation, make it a must watch stock as well. GOOGL also enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.\nStory Continues\nThe growth catalysts are, I think, very exciting and surprisingly overlooked by most market participants. Self-driving cars is one of the hottest topics out there today, and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo seems to be quietly winning the race. The self-driving technology has already been deployed in several cities across the country, completing some 100,000 rides per week by partnering with Uber Technologies (UBER). It also seems that Waymo\u2019s technology, which uses a suite of sensors, rather than camera\u2019s, is a superior approach. This approach will also give it a business advantage as it may be able to be implemented through software, rather than having to develop entire vehicles.\nWhat is crazy to me is that even with these factors, GOOGL trades at a forward earnings multiple of 21.3x, below the market average and its 10-year median of 25.8x. It also forecasts earnings to grow 17.2% annually over the next three to five years. Finally, its Zacks Earnings ESP is 0.4%, meaning it is expected to beat earnings estimates slightly at the next report.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple: Steady Growth, But AI Could Push the Stock Higher\nApple, of course one of the great stocks and companies of the world, has a slightly worse near-term outlook than the other two. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating and a worrying Zacks Earnings ESP of -17.7%. It also has the richest valuation at 30.6x forward earnings, and the lowest earnings growth projections, at 12.7% annual growth over the next three to five years.\nHowever, you should never count this stock out. Because Apple\u2019s products are so widely used, its foray into AI may become the most effective and widely used option out there. Apple Intelligence will enhance user experiences in areas like Siri, camera capabilities, health monitoring, and app functionalities, making its devices even smarter and more intuitive. I believe every incremental improvement in its products further increases our reliance on the product, deepens its moat and improves selling points.\nEspecially notable is the technical setup in AAPL stock. Although we have seen the price action trade in a sideways and volatile manner over the last four months, it has formed a very large and compelling bull flag. I would not be surprised if Apple surprised investors at its upcoming earnings and blasted higher through the breakout level. However, investors should be cautious here, as we noted the risks which could easily send the stock through the support level as well.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy AAPL, GOOGL and META Shares?\nWhile each of these tech giants faces unique challenges, their long-term growth prospects remain strong. Meta\u2019s robust earnings growth and favorable technical setup make it an intriguing opportunity, especially if it breaks out above key levels. Alphabet stands out for its relatively low valuation and the potential of Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology to drive future growth. Apple, despite near-term concerns, could see upside if its AI initiatives boost user engagement and enhance product capabilities.\nIt is always hard to say if investors should buy a stock before earnings, because the results are difficult to predict, and the stocks can be extremely volatile. Nonetheless, each of these stocks offers compelling long-term opportunity and can fit into nearly any investors portfolio.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Quote\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\nStrong Advertising to Aid META\u2019s Q3 Results\nMETA is riding on strong advertising revenue growth prospects. In the second quarter of 2024, advertising revenues increased 21.7% year over year to $38.33 billion, accounting for 97.9% of revenues. At constant currency, advertising revenues increased 23% year over year.\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 advertising revenues are expected to benefit from strong spending by advertisers as they leverage its growing AI prowess.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2024 advertising revenues is currently pegged at $39.38 billion, suggesting 17.04% year-over-year growth.\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 offerings \u2014 WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook \u2014 currently reach more than three billion people daily. Their staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 10% year over year in the second quarter of 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market, apart from Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google and YouTube.\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads. Effective usage of AI has been helping the company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst.\n\nHowever, rising expenses related to investments in developing more advanced models and AI services are expected to keep margins under pressure. The Reality Labs business continues to burn cash, which doesn\u2019t bode well for META\u2019s near-term prospects.\nMETA Shares Outperform Sector, Industry\nMETA shares have gained 60.4% year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 25.3% and the Zacks Internet Software Industry\u2019s 21.3%.\n\nMeta Platforms shares have also outperformed most of its \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d peers, including Apple AAPL, Alphabet, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft and Tesla YTD. NVIDIA is the only Magnificent 7 stock that has outperformed META shares over the same timeframe.\n\nApple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla shares have returned 19.8%, 16.5%, 22.7%, 13% and 4.9%, respectively. NVIDIA shares have appreciated 183.6% YTD.\nStory Continues\nYear-to-Date Performance Chart\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta Platforms stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, META is trading at 7.96X, higher than the broader sector\u2019s 6.14X and the industry\u2019s 2.67X.\nPrice/Sales (P/S) Ratio\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMETA Leverages AI to Boost Growth\nAI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.2 billion daily users. Meta Platforms has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook.\n\nMETA\u2019s growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth.\n\nAn expanded portfolio with the launch of a cheaper Quest 3S headset, Orion Augmented Reality glasses, new AI features for Ray-Ban Meta glasses and new multimodal features for Meta AI is a noteworthy development.\n\nThe cheaper Quest 3S offers the same mixed reality experience and fast performance as the Meta Quest 3. META also dropped the price of the Quest 3 512 GB version. These developments are expected to improve META\u2019s competitive prowess against Apple\u2019s AR device, Vision Pro.\n\nExpanding integrations with Spotify and Amazon Music, as well as new partnerships with Audible and iHeart, are expected to enhance the experience for Ray-Ban Meta AR glass users.\n\nDespite concerns over the monetization of its AI services in the near term and extending regulatory concerns, META\u2019s growth prospects are huge, driven by the growing adoption of its services. A Growth Score of B reflects this enormous opportunity for investors.\nConclusion\nMETA\u2019s use of AI bodes well for its near-term and long-term prospects. Despite a stretched valuation and growing regulatory concerns, we believe Meta Platforms\u2019 robust service offerings make the stock too attractive to ignore.\n\nMeta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting that investors should start accumulating the stock now.

Underlying replacement cost profit is the metric that BP uses as its version of net income.\nRead more: NatWest profits surge by 25% in third quarter\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell and Danni Hewson, who is the platform\u2019s head of financial analysis, said that this headline figure is their benchmark for what to expect in the third quarter, as well as the $3.3bn that BP generated in the July-to-September period last year.\nThey said that investors will also be looking at the mix of profits from BP\u2019s different business segments, before deductions including tax and finance costs are taken out, to give that overall underlying replacement cost profit figure.\nStory continues\nIn the previous quarter, BP\u2019s oil production arm made a profit of $3.1bn, while gas generated $1.4bn and its downstream customers and products operations made $1.1bn.\nCapital expenditure will be another metric in focus, with BP budgeting for $16bn in capex this year, which AJ Bell\u2019s Mould and Hewson said represented a \u201cbig drop\u201d from last year.\nThey said that the focus on the health of the company\u2019s cash flow and balance sheet was important, as these can \u201cfacilitate cash returns to shareholders\u201d.\nBoth BP and fellow oil major Shell are \u201crebuilding their dividends after the cuts of 2020\u201d, they pointed out. BP has a quarterly dividend of $0.08, though this is still lower than its peak payout of $0.105.\nBP announced a further $1.75bn in share repurchases for the second quarter and committed to another $3.5bn in buybacks in the second half of the year.\n\u2022 USD\n(BP.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Thursday 31 October\nShell's shares are down 6.5% on a one-year basis.\nIn its trading update giving a glimpse into what it expects for the third quarter, Shell said it expected indicative refining margins to fall to $5.5 a barrel, down from $7.7 in the second quarter. This would represent a 30% fall in refining margins.\nIn terms of headline profits, the focus for Shell is on its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (or EBITDA) figure. The oil major generated adjusted EBITDA of $16.8bn in the second quarter, which was down from the previous three months. In Q3 last year, Shell posted adjusted EBITDA of $16.3bn.\nRead more: UK consumer confidence slips ahead of autumn budget as concerns rise over global outlook\n\u201cAt Shell, gas was again a bigger earner than oil production in the second quarter,\u201d said AJ Bell\u2019s Mould and Hewson.\nOn capex, Shell\u2019s target of between $22bn and $25bn is far below its $40bn peak in 2013, they said.\nWhile Shell didn\u2019t provide guidance on its net debt in its recent update, this figure stood at \u00a338.3bn as of the end of the second quarter, falling by $2.2bn on the previous three months.\nShell\u2019s quarterly dividend was back up to $0.34 per share, though this was once again lower than a high of $0.47.\nIn its second quarter results, the oil major also announced a further $3.5bn share buyback programme for the following three months.\n\u2022 USD\n(SHEL.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nUber (UBER) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Thursday 31 October\nShares in Uber ticked lower following reports last week that the company was eyeing a potential takeover offer for Expedia.\nThe Financial Times reported that Uber had \"explored a possible bid\" for travel website.\nUber had reportedly approached advisers in recent months, though no formal approach was said to have been made to Expedia, nor are there currently any discussions around the matter.\nThe ride-hailing company's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi led Expedia from 2005 to 2017 and still remains a non-executive director on the company's board.\nIn another interview with the Financial Times, Khosrowshahi said: \u201cAnywhere you want to go in your city and anything that you want to get, we want to empower you to do so.\u201d\nRead more: What households should expect from Rachel Reeves' budget\nThis signalled the CEO's aim of Uber having a broader reach, beyond its origins in ride-hailing and comes as competition in that space heats up.\nOn Wednesday, Tesla (TSLA) announced that it expected to roll out autonomous ride-hailing in California and Texas in 202, which weighed on the shares of Uber and rival Lyft (LYFT).\nUber's third quarter results could provide a boost to its share price, given the stock's jump after its second-quarter update in August.\nThe company reported 16% year-over-year revenue growth, posting $10.70bn in revenue for its second quarter against estimates of $10.58bn. Earnings per share of $0.47 also came in ahead of an expected $0.39. Uber also reported gross bookings of $40bn, up 19% year-on-year.\nFor the third quarter, Uber guided to gross booking of between $40.25bn and $41.75bn, which represent growth of between 18% and 23% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to come in at $1.58bn to $1.68bn, would equate to a year-on-year increase of 45% to 54%.\n\u2022 USD\n(UBER)\nFollow\nView quote details\nHSBC (HSBA.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Tuesday 29 October\nFollowing on from quarterly reports by three of the UK's big banks \u2014 Lloyds (LLOY.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and NatWest (NWG.L) \u2014 it is now the turn of Europe's largest lender HSBC.\nThis week, the bank's new CEO Georges Elhedery, unveiled an overhaul of the bank's structure, dividing it into four businesses.\nIn an announcement outlining the changes, HSBC said this was aimed at reducing the \"duplication of processes and decision making\" in the business.\nElhedery said: \"The new structure will result in a simpler, more dynamic, and agile organisation as we focus on executing against our strategic priorities, which remain unchanged.\"\nIn addition, HSBC announced that it appointed Pam Kaur as group chief financial officer (CFO). Kaur, who joined HSBC in 2013 and is currently group chief risk and compliance officer, is the first woman to hold the role of CFO in the bank's 159-year history.\nRead more: Record number of millionaires to leave UK amid tax increase fears\nThe bank reported pre-tax profit of $21.56bn in the first half of year, which was stable compared with the same period last year.\nMeanwhile, revenue was up 1% to $37.3bn, versus the same period in the first half of 2023.\nHSBC also announced a share buyback programme of up to $3bn, which it expected to complete within three months. The bank also approved a second interim dividend of $0.10 per share.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter, consensus estimates from brokers expect HSBC to report profit before tax of $7.6bn, according to figures provided by the bank.\nBrokers are also anticipating net interest income, which refers to the gap between what it pays out to savers and borrowers in interest, to come in at $8.15bn for the quarter.\n\u2022 USD\n(HSBA.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nIntel (INTC) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Thursday 31 October\nShares in Intel had slid nearly 55% year-to-date, with the company facing a series of struggles this year.\nIn the second quarter, Intel posted second-quarter revenues of $12.8bn, down 1% year-on-year.\nThe company also reported an earnings per share loss of $0.38, with it anticipating a loss of $0.24 in the third quarter. Intel also forecasted revenues to be between $12.5bn and $13.5bn for the quarter.\nOn the back of the results, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger outlined \"significant actions to reduce\" costs in the business.\nAs part of its goal of delivering $10bn in cost savings in 2025, Gelsinger said in a note to employees that the company would be looking to cut around 15,000 roles, or 15% of its workforce.\n\"Our costs are too high, our margins are too low,\" he said. \"We need bolder actions to address both \u2013 particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.\"\nRead more: Lloyds profits flat but beat estimates\nIn addition to reducing operational costs, Intel had also decided to suspend its dividend beginning in the third quarter.\nAJ Bell's Mould and Hewson said the shares now trade their lowest level in more than decade and are no higher than where they stood in 1997. This was \"when Intel was the undisputed leader in microprocessors (way ahead of AMD (AMD)) and was a key part of the Wintel (Windows-Intel) hegemony that cemented its own and Microsoft\u2019s dominant positions in the desktop and personal computing markets,\" they said.\n\"Since then, Intel has failed to crack the smartphone market, struggled to penetrate foundry and threaten Taiwanese dominance and seen AMD start to make inroads into its market share in the field of AI, despite December 2023\u2019s launch of the Core Ultra processor,\" they explained.\nGoing into the third quarter results, they said that given \"expectations for both this quarter and the next one are already low...it may not take much to surprise on the upside\".\n\u2022 USD\n(INTC)\nFollow\nView quote details\nOther companies reporting next week include:\nMonday 28 October\nPhilips PHG (PHG)\nWaste Management (WM)\nFord (F)\nON Semiconductor (ON)\nF5 (FFIV)\nAmkor (AMKR)\nRambus (RMBS)\nTuesday 29 October\nYouGov (YOU.L)\nC&C (CCR.L)\nPearson (PSON.L)\nElementis (ELM.L)\nNovartis (NVS)\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\nSaint-Gobain (SGO.PA)\nAdidas (ADDYY)\nFerrovial (FER)\nASM International (ASMIY)\nUPM-Kymmene (UPMKF)\nMoncler (MOV.F)\nDavide Campari Milano (CPR.MI)\nLufthansa (LHA.DE)\nVisa (V)\nAMD (AMD)\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\nPfizer (PFE)\nStryker (SYK)\nMondelez (MDLZ)\nPaypal (PYPL)\nChipotle (CMG)\nRoyal Caribbean (RCL)\nElectronic Arts (EA)\nSnap (SNAP)\nQorvo (QRVO)\nCaesar\u2019s Entertainment (CZR)\nWednesday 30 October\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\nStandard Chartered (STAN.L)\nNext (NXT.L)\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\nComputacentre (CCC.L)\nSchneider (SBGSF)\nAirbus (AIR.PA)\nUBS (UBS)\nAXA (CS.PA)\nVolkswagen (VOW.DE)\nBASF (BAS.DE)\nWolters Kluwer (WOSB.DE)\nCapGemini (CGEMY)\nSKF (SKFG)\nTod\u2019s (TODGF)\nEli Lilly (LLY)\nAbbvie (ABBV)\nCaterpillar (CAT)\nAmgen (AMGN)\nStarbucks (SBUX)\nKLA (KLAC)\nAirbnb (ABNB)\nDoordash (DASH)\nCoinbase Global (COIN)\nKraft Heinz (KHC)\nHess (HESM)\nGE Healthcare (GEHC)\neBay (EBAY)\nRockwell (ROK)\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD)\nZimmer Biomet (ZBH)\nWolfspeed (WOLF)\nThursday 31 October\nSpectris (SXS.L)\nHaleon (HLN.L)\nSmith & Nephew (SN.L)\nCoca-Cola HBC (CCH.L)\nJapan Tobacco (2914.T)\nFujitsu (6702.T)\nPanasonic (6752.T)\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\nICBC (1398.HK)\nAgricultural Bank of China (601288.SS)\nChina Construction Bank (601939.SS)\nBank of China (518890.SS)\nBYD (BYD)\nFoxconn (601138.SS)\nCosco Shipping (2866.HK)\nTotalEnergies (TTE)\nAnheuser-Busch InBev (ABIB.XC)\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\nIntesa SanPaolo (IITSF)\nBBVA (BBVA)\nING (ING)\nUniversal Music (UMG.AS)\nStellantis (STLA)\nSTMicroelectronics (SGM.F)\nAP M\u00f8ller-Maersk (MAERSK-B.CO)\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (GLE.PA)\nCarlsberg (CARL-B.CO)\nRepsol (REP.MC)\nMastercard (MA)\nMerck (MRK)\nLinde (LIN)\nComcast (CMCSA)\nConocoPhillips (COP)\nBristol-Meyers Squibb (BMY)\nEst\u00e9e Lauder (EL)\nRoblox (RBLX)\nKellanova (K)\nBall (BALL)\nNorwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)\nUS Steel (X)\nSpirit Aerosystems (SPR)\nFriday 1 November\nMacquarie (MQG.AX)\nMitsubishi (8058.T)\nTDK (6762.T)\nExxonMobil (XOM)\nChevron (CVX)\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nTesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company\u2019s quarterly results with a flurry of buying.\nA 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d counterparts \u2014 and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began.\nThat means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there\u2019s one chart that encompasses 2024\u2019s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out.\nFor example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic \u2014 significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week\u2019s gains.\nZooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla\u2019s membership in this informal \u2014 but important \u2014 cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year.\nPerhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark \u2014 who\u2019s above it and who\u2019s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors.\nNvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies \u2014 30% of the index \u2014 that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market\u2019s broadening and rotation.\nSince the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek\u2019s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven.\n\u201cIf one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cOur own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.\u201d\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about.\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech.\nCramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted.\n\u201c... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.\u201d\nCramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day\u2019s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn\u2019t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts.\n\u201cSee, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.\u201d\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\nHe addressed the \u201calleged earnings disappointment,\u201d clarifying that he chose the term \u201calleged\u201d because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts.\nStory Continues\nHe reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment.\nConcluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked:\n\u201cBut the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nCramer mentioned that Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock did not see highs that some of its peers did. He also commented on the latest news about iPhone sales. He said:\n\u201cSee today we've got some negative news about iPhone sales. Not enough to make me wanna sell, but enough to ding the stock. And that wasn't just analyst reports, you also got a number from Verizon that didn't jive with the thesis that Apple iPhones are selling well\u2026 I would own, not trade Apple.\u201d\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), widely recognized for its groundbreaking iPhone, has solidified its reputation as one of the most respected companies in history. Currently, the company is approaching a crucial upgrade cycle, largely driven by innovations in artificial intelligence. However, recent market reactions indicate some caution. Following the third-quarter results from Verizon, the company\u2019s shares experienced a decline.\nAnalyst Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson highlighted Verizon\u2019s low upgrade rate of 3.0% for retail postpaid connections, a drop from 3.4% in the same quarter the previous year when the last iPhone was launched.\nMoffett pointed out that with only two weeks of iPhone 16 sales included in Verizon\u2019s Q3 data, it is premature to conclude that the upcoming Apple cycle will be smaller than last year. Nonetheless, he noted that this was not an encouraging start. In a similar vein, AT&T CEO John Stankey remarked during his company\u2019s earnings call that initial iPhone sales figures were slightly down compared to the previous year.\nOn October 23, according to TipRanks, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that recent surveys revealed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has reduced its orders for the iPhone 16 by approximately 10 million units for the fourth quarter of 2024 through the first half of 2025. Most of these reductions affected the non-Pro models, leading to a new production estimate of 84 million units for the second half of 2024, down from around 88 million.\nConsequently, total iPhone production forecasts for the upcoming quarters have also been adjusted, now projected at about 80 million, 45 million, and 39 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, the first quarter of 2025, and the second quarter of 2025, respectively. While some investors are hopeful that advancements in Apple Intelligence could significantly increase iPhone shipments in the near future, Kuo believes that the recent order reductions indicate such optimistic expectations may not be realized in the immediate future.\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n2024 has been a big year for AI breakthroughs, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Generative AI has arguably been the biggest trend, with McKinsey estimating that it could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries annually, based on 63 use cases they analyzed. Back in 2022, when OpenAI launched its free web app, ChatGPT, few could have predicted the scale of the AI revolution that would follow. Major tech giants have since followed suit, revealing their own chatbot-based assistants, AI-enabled phones, and much more.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and\u00a020 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\nAs AI continues to revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries to new heights, today\u2019s headlines reveal just how impactful these advancements can be. The question of the hour is, with all of these big AI breakthroughs, are regulators finally catching up with developers working on their next big AI projects? Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The company leverages AI to enhance functionality, user experience, and security across its products.\nOn Wednesday, October 23, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) released a beta version of its iPhone operating system, iOS 18.2. This version includes a large number of Apple Intelligence features, with the much-awaited ChatGPT integration. Investors are hopeful that these AI features will help fuel iPhone upgrades since they are only available on the newer devices. The iOS 18.2 preview features new capabilities for users to customize text rewrites by Apple Intelligence, Genmoji for generating new emoji, Image Playground as an AI image generator, Visual Intelligence, and integration with ChatGPT. According to Apple, the official public release of the Apple Intelligence features will be next week as part of the official iOS 18.1 release.\nWedgewood Partners, an investment management company, highlighted stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), in the third quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what they state regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance as investors continued to favorably discount the recent unveiling of its AI strategy. As we have noted in the past, the Company has been at the forefront of proprietary semiconductor computer processor development for well over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. Apple\u2019s AI value proposition should compel consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss.

Earnings are forecast to grow at an impressive 19.15% annually over the next three to five years, while the company also has a reasonable valuation of 26.5x forward earnings, just above the market average.\nLooking at META\u2019s stock chart, I also see a compelling technical setup. We can see just a few weeks ago the stock broke out from a clear bull flag, which sent it to new record highs. Today, there is a very similar pattern building. If the stock can break out above the $580 level, it should send it again to new highs. However, the market may wait until the earnings report to make the move.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nAlphabet: Cheapest Stock Among the Group\nAlthough Alphabet stock has struggled this year when compared to Apple, Meta and the broad market, it remains one of the premier assets in the market. Its entrenched business model and growth catalysts, combined with a relatively cheap valuation, make it a must watch stock as well. GOOGL also enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.\nStory Continues\nThe growth catalysts are, I think, very exciting and surprisingly overlooked by most market participants. Self-driving cars is one of the hottest topics out there today, and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo seems to be quietly winning the race. The self-driving technology has already been deployed in several cities across the country, completing some 100,000 rides per week by partnering with Uber Technologies (UBER). It also seems that Waymo\u2019s technology, which uses a suite of sensors, rather than camera\u2019s, is a superior approach. This approach will also give it a business advantage as it may be able to be implemented through software, rather than having to develop entire vehicles.\nWhat is crazy to me is that even with these factors, GOOGL trades at a forward earnings multiple of 21.3x, below the market average and its 10-year median of 25.8x. It also forecasts earnings to grow 17.2% annually over the next three to five years. Finally, its Zacks Earnings ESP is 0.4%, meaning it is expected to beat earnings estimates slightly at the next report.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple: Steady Growth, But AI Could Push the Stock Higher\nApple, of course one of the great stocks and companies of the world, has a slightly worse near-term outlook than the other two. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating and a worrying Zacks Earnings ESP of -17.7%. It also has the richest valuation at 30.6x forward earnings, and the lowest earnings growth projections, at 12.7% annual growth over the next three to five years.\nHowever, you should never count this stock out. Because Apple\u2019s products are so widely used, its foray into AI may become the most effective and widely used option out there. Apple Intelligence will enhance user experiences in areas like Siri, camera capabilities, health monitoring, and app functionalities, making its devices even smarter and more intuitive. I believe every incremental improvement in its products further increases our reliance on the product, deepens its moat and improves selling points.\nEspecially notable is the technical setup in AAPL stock. Although we have seen the price action trade in a sideways and volatile manner over the last four months, it has formed a very large and compelling bull flag. I would not be surprised if Apple surprised investors at its upcoming earnings and blasted higher through the breakout level. However, investors should be cautious here, as we noted the risks which could easily send the stock through the support level as well.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy AAPL, GOOGL and META Shares?\nWhile each of these tech giants faces unique challenges, their long-term growth prospects remain strong. Meta\u2019s robust earnings growth and favorable technical setup make it an intriguing opportunity, especially if it breaks out above key levels. Alphabet stands out for its relatively low valuation and the potential of Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology to drive future growth. Apple, despite near-term concerns, could see upside if its AI initiatives boost user engagement and enhance product capabilities.\nIt is always hard to say if investors should buy a stock before earnings, because the results are difficult to predict, and the stocks can be extremely volatile. Nonetheless, each of these stocks offers compelling long-term opportunity and can fit into nearly any investors portfolio.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., seeking to make further inroads in health care, tested an app this year to help people with prediabetes manage their food intake and make lifestyle changes, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nOman Sees an Urban Future Distinct From Dubai and Abu Dhabi\nThe company tested the service on select employees earlier this year, part of its broader push into blood-sugar features, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is secret. Though Apple doesn\u2019t have plans to release the app, the company may eventually integrate the technology into future health products, including a noninvasive glucose tracker that it\u2019s been developing for more than a decade.\nThe employees involved in the test needed to validate that they were prediabetic with a blood test. That means they don\u2019t currently have diabetes but may be at risk of developing the Type 2 version of the disease. As part of the test, they actively monitored their blood sugar via various devices available on the market and then logged glucose-level changes in response to food intake.\nThe idea behind the system is to show consumers how certain foods can affect blood sugar \u2014 with the hope of inspiring changes that could ward off diabetes. For instance, if users logged that they ate pasta for lunch and that their blood sugar spiked, they could be told to stop eating the pasta or switch to protein.\nThe study was intended to explore the possible uses for blood-sugar data and what tools the company could potentially create for consumers. For now, though, the app test has been paused to let Apple focus on other health features. A company spokesperson declined to comment.\nMakers of devices that treat conditions associated with diabetes slid after the report was published Friday, though they soon rebounded. Insulet Corp., which makes insulin pumps, fell as much as 4.7%. Glucose monitor maker Dexcom Inc. dropped as much as 5.3% before bouncing back, and Tandem Diabetes Care Inc. slid as much as 3.4%. Apple, meanwhile, rose about 1% to $232.45.\nThe work indicates that glucose tracking and food logging could be two important areas of expansion for Apple in the future. The company\u2019s current health app lacks features for logging meals, a contrast with rival services. The research could also lead to Apple integrating third-party glucose tracking more deeply into its offerings.\nStory Continues\nThe research wasn\u2019t directly tied to Apple\u2019s longstanding effort to build a no-prick glucose monitor, but it could ultimately help inform how the company handles that project. The noninvasive checker is one of Apple\u2019s most ambitious health initiatives. The idea is to analyze a person\u2019s blood without pricking the skin \u2014 a potentially groundbreaking advance in the fight against diabetes.\nApple often uses employee studies to get health features ready for public launches. It took a similar tack with its hearing aid and sleep apnea detection features for AirPods and the Apple Watch. The Cupertino, California-based company has multiple labs on its campus for testing health features.\nThe glucose studies were highly secretive \u2014 even compared with Apple\u2019s previous projects \u2014 and employees required specific vetting from managers before they could partake in the program. Several medical and nondisclosure agreements were also required to participate.\nToday, glucose-testing systems typically require a blood sample, often through a finger prick. There also are small shoulder-worn patches from Abbott Laboratories and Dexcom that are less cumbersome \u2014 though they still require insertion into the skin.\nAbout 15 years ago, Apple set out to create something less invasive. The project \u2014 dubbed E5 \u2014 was so under-the-radar at the start that Apple created a subsidiary dubbed Avolonte Health LLC to operate it. That unit was eventually moved to Apple\u2019s hardware technologies group and is now run by a deputy to the company\u2019s head of silicon chips.\nLast year, Bloomberg News reported that Apple had made headway on the project and believed it was finally on track to eventually commercialize the technology. But an actual product is still years away. Before the company can shrink down the sensor enough to fit in a smartwatch, it is working on an iPhone-sized prototype. And even with that format, Apple has run into challenges with miniaturization and overheating.\nThe system uses lasers to shoot light into the skin and determine how much glucose is in the blood. Though Apple hopes to eventually provide specific blood-sugar readings, the initial version will likely be designed to just notify users if they may be prediabetic.\nApple is taking a similar strategy with new sleep apnea notifications, which can tell smartwatch wearers if they may have the condition. An upcoming hypertension detection feature will work in much the same way.\n--With assistance from Angel Adegbesan.\n(Updates with more on share reaction in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nTesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company\u2019s quarterly results with a flurry of buying.\nA 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d counterparts \u2014 and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began.\nThat means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there\u2019s one chart that encompasses 2024\u2019s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out.\nFor example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic \u2014 significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week\u2019s gains.\nZooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla\u2019s membership in this informal \u2014 but important \u2014 cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year.\nPerhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark \u2014 who\u2019s above it and who\u2019s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors.\nNvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies \u2014 30% of the index \u2014 that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market\u2019s broadening and rotation.\nSince the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek\u2019s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven.\n\u201cIf one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cOur own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.\u201d\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about.\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech.\nCramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted.\n\u201c... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.\u201d\nCramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day\u2019s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn\u2019t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts.\n\u201cSee, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.\u201d\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\nHe addressed the \u201calleged earnings disappointment,\u201d clarifying that he chose the term \u201calleged\u201d because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts.\nStory Continues\nHe reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment.\nConcluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked:\n\u201cBut the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nCramer mentioned investors' fluctuating sentiments about Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) earnings. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\u201cHow about Amazon, which is closing on its all-time high again, just over 10 points from here. Even as its last quarter was hated, suddenly though, Amazon's loved for its consistency, long-term consistency I guess.\u201d\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a renowned global technology company specializing in online retail, advertising, and subscription services. Despite its prominent position in the market, the company faced challenges following its second-quarter results in late July, with shares in response to weaker-than-expected revenue growth of 10%.\nWhile Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to show strong performance with a 19% increase in sales, contributing $26.3 billion, this growth was not sufficient to offset a modest 7% rise in international revenue and a 9% gain in its domestic e-commerce sector. Recent optimism surrounding the stock should be noted and it can largely be attributed to the ongoing success of its AWS platform, which serves as a driver of the company's overall profitability.\nOn October 22, The Fly reported that BMO Capital kept an Outperform rating and $230 price target on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The firm increased its forecast for Q3 AWS Cloud growth to 20% from 19%. Additionally, BMO has raised its FY24 earnings per share estimate for the company by 4 cents to $4.53 and its FY25 estimate by 3 cents to $5.30. The firm anticipates potential acceleration for the company, driven by the normalization of optimization efforts in the latter half of 2024 and the ongoing adoption of Bedrock.\nHowever, BMO also cautions that the consumer trade-down effect is a significant variable for the second half of the year, noting a mixed outlook where strong back-to-school spending may be offset by declines in beauty, electronics, and home goods.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "In the battle for America's shoppers, Walmart (WMT) is still dominating Target (TGT).\nThe world's biggest retailer continues to gain high-income shoppers in the face of sticky inflation while it expands its membership and advertising revenue. It's maintained its edge in value, offering grocery prices that are about 10% to 12% cheaper for an average basket of food, per Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane.\n\"The Walmart thesis is they're really among the biggest and best retailers out there,\" Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman told Yahoo Finance over the phone. The company is \"well positioned when times are tough, they're well positioned when things are getting better.\"\nWalmart has done \"a very good job going after a more affluent consumer and keep retaining their core customer\" of lower- to middle-income consumers, Feldman added.\nGroceries make up 60% of US sales for Walmart but just 20% to 25% of Target's sales, per Morningstar analyst Noah Rohr.\nGo inside the fascinating leadership journey of Target CEO Brian Cornell\nTarget has been trying to turn the tide, announcing a plan in May to cut prices on 5,000 goods, which Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes said \"brought a positive momentum to foot traffic for Target.\"\nThis week, Target announced another price cut on 2,000 items ahead of the holiday.\n\"We believe that additional pricing cuts could spur additional traffic as we enter the crucial Holiday shopping season. Overall, we view this announcement as positive for Target's top-line and comparable sales ahead,\" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe wrote in a note to clients.\nWalmart isn't just competing with Target, but also supermarket chains, drug stores, and discount stores. In the latest quarter, its US same-store sales were up 4.3%, while Target's declined 2.0%.\nInvestors have awarded the results. Walmart's stock is up 52% in 2024, compared to Target's 5% gain and the S&P 500's 23% gain.\nWalmart's edge in the food aisles continues to help counter soft sales in categories like toys, apparel, and electronics. \"Discretionary has been down for the last 10 quarters,\" McShane said, with some signs of recovery at both retailers. In 2025, discretionary goods spending is expected to grow, which could be a boost for Target, said McShane.\nWhen it comes to branching into other high-margin businesses, like memberships, e-commerce, and retail advertising, Walmart also took a head start.\nThe company launched its Amazon (AMZN) Prime competitor, Walmart+, in 2020 for $98 per year. Target only started its Target Circle 360 program this March for $99 a year. Both include same-day delivery, though Target has a $35 minimum.\nStory Continues\nWalmart+ touts additional perks, like savings on Paramount+ subscriptions, 25% off Burger King digital orders, $0.10 off a gallon of gas at over 13,000 stations, pickup for returns at customers' homes, and even free tire repair.\n\"What really happened with Target Circle is they didn't do a lot with Target Circle during the COVID years where they were over-performing everybody,\" Ohmes said. \"They really had to get beyond COVID ... beyond the inventory issues they had in 2022, and that led to the clearance issues they had in 2023.\"\nNow Target is trying to invest more aggressively in its loyalty rewards and paid memberships. It's offering Circle members an extra 30 days for returns, plus same-day orders from dozens of retailers through the Shipt Marketplace.\nLast quarter, Walmart US saw its e-commerce sales jump 3%, boosted by store pickups and delivery.\n\"Pickup is growing faster than our in-store or club sales, and delivery is growing even faster than pickup. Delivery accuracy and speed continue to improve,\" CEO Doug McMillon said on the earnings call.\nTarget saw its digital sales jump 8.7% year over year. CEO Brian Cornell said its Drive Up and Target Circle 360 programs both grew sales in the low teens. He added that same-day services now make up two-thirds of its digital sales, with most customers opting for Drive Up, which brought in $2 billion in sales in Q2.\nWalmart Connect, the company's advertising business, has also been blooming. Its US revenue grew 30% year over year, with advertising sales by online marketplace sellers up nearly 50%.\nTarget is trying to develop its own offering, Target Roundel. Cornell said it \"continues to experience rapid growth based on the joint value it creates for both our guests and our vendors,\" with double-digit revenue growth. It's expected to grow in the \"high teens\" for the full fiscal year, after \"more than 20% growth in 2023.\"\nNeither retailer has shared exact revenue figures for its ads business. For reference, Amazon's ad unit boasted a 20% revenue growth year over year last quarter, bringing $12.77 billion in Q2.\nWalmart's e-commerce marketplace is \"getting very close to being profitable\" at Walmart, said McShane.\n\"There's more buy-in from the investor base [in] the alternative revenue streams that Walmart's been going after... that they are faster-growing and higher-margin businesses that should drive better profitability for the company longer term,\" McShane said.\n\"Walmart's had a great year and they've been outperforming ... From a fundamental standpoint, all is going so well for them from a stock perspective. Plus, it doesn't look like we're done ... With the setup for this holiday season, everybody's searching for value.

Generative AI has arguably been the biggest trend, with McKinsey estimating that it could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries annually, based on 63 use cases they analyzed. Back in 2022, when OpenAI launched its free web app, ChatGPT, few could have predicted the scale of the AI revolution that would follow. Major tech giants have since followed suit, revealing their own chatbot-based assistants, AI-enabled phones, and much more.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and\u00a020 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\nAs AI continues to revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries to new heights, today\u2019s headlines reveal just how impactful these advancements can be. The question of the hour is, with all of these big AI breakthroughs, are regulators finally catching up with developers working on their next big AI projects? Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American technology company offering e-commerce, cloud computing, and other services, including digital streaming and artificial intelligence solutions. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses artificial intelligence for everything from reinventing shopping experiences to optimizing supply chain, and more with generative AI powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nOn Tuesday, October 22, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) backed Anthropic announced that it has reached a new artificial intelligence milestone for the company. Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that aims to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. The company has released an upgraded version of its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. The model can understand and interact with any desktop app via a new \u201cComputer Use\u201d API, now in open beta. It can imitate keystrokes, button clicks, and mouse gestures, just like a human.\n\u201cWe trained Claude to see what\u2019s happening on a screen and then use the software tools available to carry out tasks. When a developer tasks Claude with using a piece of computer software and gives it the necessary access, Claude looks at screenshots of what\u2019s visible to the user, then counts how many pixels vertically or horizontally it needs to move a cursor in order to click in the correct place.\u201d\nThe feature was released in public beta on Tuesday, and it is expected that it will be open to consumers and enterprise clients over the next few months.\n\u201cWe want Claude to be able to actually assist people with all sorts of different kinds of work, and we think the chatbot setup is fairly limited because you can ask a question and [get] context but it stops there\u201d.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Netflix's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n51% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders\nInsiders have sold recently\nIf you want to know who really controls Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nAnd as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 9.7% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 87%.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Netflix.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Netflix\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Netflix?\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nNetflix already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Netflix's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Netflix. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nStory Continues\nInsider Ownership Of Netflix\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur information suggests that Netflix, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.9b worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nNext Steps:\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Netflix better, we need to consider many other factors.\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The company reported revenue growth of 2.8% QoQ and 15% YoY, with revenue beating estimates by $57 million. GAAP EPS also exceeded expectations at $5.40, while subscriber numbers surged to 282.7 million, outpacing estimates by 4 million. The net income margin reached an impressive 24.1%, up 450 basis points compared to the same quarter last year, signaling operational efficiency despite competitive pressures.\nDespite facing stiff competition from peers like Disney and Amazon Prime, Netflix\u2019s Q3 results have displayed its ability to maintain its competitive edge. Netflix's strategy of expanding beyond traditional streaming, into areas like live events, gaming, advertising, and international markets, has broadened its total addressable market. The platform's ability to secure high-profile events, such as the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match and NFL games, exemplifies its ability to capture large, engaged audiences.\nNetflix\u2019s approach to flexible pricing models has also been key to sustaining growth. In some regions, such as Japan, the U.S., and Spain, prices have been raised, while in other markets, the company has introduced lower-priced, ad-supported plans. These ad-supported tiers now account for over 50% of new sign-ups, offering a solution for price-sensitive consumers while allowing Netflix to monetize a broader audience. However, the introduction of ad-supported plans also reflects underlying consumer weakness, highlighting the company's need to balance affordability with profitability.\nThe ad platform, still in its early stages, offers significant long-term potential. Despite growing competition in the digital advertising space, Netflix's unmatched audience engagement provides a unique value proposition to advertisers. As companies increasingly invest in digital ads, Netflix stands out by offering premium placements in highly anticipated content, positioning itself as a future leader in this lucrative market. With strong user engagement, the company can command high CPMs, giving it a competitive edge over other platforms.\nStory Continues\nInternational expansion remains another key opportunity for Netflix. Revenue growth of 16% YoY in both the U.S. and Canada and EMEA markets, alongside 19% growth in Asia Pacific and 9% in LATAM, demonstrates Netflix's ability to scale globally, although volatility remains in emerging markets.\nBasically, the bullish thesis on Netflix stems from the fact that the company is diversifying its revenue streams and expanding its total addressable market (TAM).

Many are closely watching trends and data that could impact future growth and stability.\nTom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently shared his insights on the current market trends during an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 14. He acknowledged that he underestimated the strength of the market, noting that it has been surprisingly resilient despite expectations of volatility leading up to the 2024 election. Lee highlighted that there is a significant amount of cash\u2014about $6 trillion\u2014sitting on the sidelines, which has contributed to the market\u2019s stability. He observed that many investors had anticipated a recession, but instead, companies have shown strong earnings and resilience.\nLee also mentioned that the Federal Reserve is likely to adopt a supportive stance as inflation data continues to trend toward their 2% target. He believes that regardless of who wins the upcoming election, stocks are likely to perform well in the following year. Lee pointed out that markets tend to thrive on visibility and certainty, suggesting that if one candidate appears to be gaining an advantage, it could lead to a more favorable trading environment before the election. Overall, he remains optimistic about the market\u2019s outlook.\nS&P 500 and Dow Reach New Heights Ahead of Election Season\nOn October 18, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached new record highs, marking six consecutive weeks of gains for these major indices. As reported by CNBC, the S&P 500 rose by 0.40%, closing at 5,864.67, while the Dow rose by 0.09% and added 36.86 points to close at 43,275.91. The Nasdaq also performed well, increasing 0.63% to close at 18,489.55. This marks the longest winning streak of the year for both the Dow and S&P 500, with notable increases in their overall performance.\nAs earnings season progresses, over 70 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their results, with about 75% of those companies surpassing expectations. Despite potential market volatility leading up to the upcoming election, some analysts believe that stocks may continue to rise through November.\nRob Williams, a chief investment strategist at Sage Advisory, noted that this trend is unusual for an election year, where markets typically hesitate before improving post-election. He suggested that investors might be optimistic about a possible victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose policies are seen as more favorable for businesses in terms of regulations and taxes.\nStory Continues\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 30 stocks.\nNext, we focused on identifying stocks that had demonstrated consistent growth.

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nTesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company\u2019s quarterly results with a flurry of buying.\nA 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d counterparts \u2014 and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began.\nThat means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there\u2019s one chart that encompasses 2024\u2019s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out.\nFor example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic \u2014 significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week\u2019s gains.\nZooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla\u2019s membership in this informal \u2014 but important \u2014 cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year.\nPerhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark \u2014 who\u2019s above it and who\u2019s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors.\nNvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies \u2014 30% of the index \u2014 that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market\u2019s broadening and rotation.\nSince the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek\u2019s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven.\n\u201cIf one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cOur own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.\u201d\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

          "whole_article": "The AI and data solutions provider Palantir Technologies (PLTR), is scheduled to report its Q3 earnings on November 4, aiming to sustain its impressive growth trajectory this year. Although momentum in the AI sector remains strong, I have concerns about Palantir\u2019s ability to sustain its rally. Specifically, the company relies heavily on positive annual guidance updates to demonstrate that demand for its software is still robust, which may pose a risk if future updates fall short. Therefore, I believe a neutral stance may be prudent for Palantir ahead of the Q3 report.\nFurthermore, although Palantir\u2019s AI growth story is still in its early stages and its fundamentals may ultimately justify its current share price in the coming years, I believe that investors who have purchased shares at these valuations ahead of the Q3 report may be paying overly optimistic multiples.\nReviewing Palantir\u2019s Performance in 2024\nBefore delving into the reasons for my skepticism regarding Palantir\u2019s ability to sustain the impressive bullish momentum, it\u2019s important to highlight the factors contributing to its remarkable triple-digit growth in market value over the past twelve months.\nIn the last two quarters, Palantir reported revenue growth of 20.8% in Q1 and 27.1% in Q2, with gross profits increasing by 24% and 28%, respectively. This led to a gross profit margin of 81%, surpassing Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) margin of 75%. Much of this success can be attributed to the expansion of its commercial sector, particularly its AI-powered Foundry and AIP platforms, which grew 55% year-over-year in Q2, compared to a 24% increase in government contracts. CEO Alex Karp noted an \u2018unrelenting wave of demand\u2019 for production-ready AI systems, emphasizing Palantir\u2019s unique ability to meet that demand.\nOver the past two quarters, Palantir has consistently raised its full-year guidance, primarily driven by strong commercial revenue growth, with yearly growth rate estimates increasing from 45% in Q1 to 47% in Q2. The company also revised its total revenue projections, raising its full-year 2024 estimate from $2.677 to $2.689 billion in Q1 to $2.742 to $2.750 billion in Q2. Additionally, it adjusted its income from operations guidance to $966 to $974 million, up from the Q1 forecast of $868 to $880 million.\nPalantir\u2019s Q3 Will Likely Hinge on Guidance Updates\nWhile it\u2019s hard to argue against Palantir\u2019s strong performance in the first half of the year, I believe that moving forward, just hitting top estimates won\u2019t be enough to sustain its bullish momentum. With expectations already sky-high for Q3, Palantir faces added pressure. Although I expect the company to surpass those estimates, in my view, an upward revision of its full-year guidance will be essential to maintain the stock\u2019s momentum.\nStory Continues\nThe company provided Q3 revenue guidance of $697 million to $701 million, with Wall Street favoring the high end. All 16 analysts covering the stock have revised their estimates upward, resulting in a consensus of $703.4 million, which would represent a 26% annual growth rate.\nAdditionally, with adjusted net income guidance of $233 million to $237 million for Q3\u2014suggesting a potential annual increase of 46% at the upper end\u2014Wall Street is forecasting an EPS consensus of $0.09, reflecting a 29.8% annual increase. All analysts have also raised their EPS estimates in the past three months.\nAs Palantir\u2019s growth story is centered around the massive demand for AI, which is still in its early stages, there is a strong belief that the company will continue to revise its annual guidance upward to better reflect its growth prospects. I think whether this quarter is a hit or a miss will largely hinge on any updates to that full-year guidance. This is because the current projections do not seem sufficient to fully justify Palantir\u2019s lofty valuations, a topic I will explore further.\nPLTR\u2019s Exaggerated Valuation Multiples Increase Pressure\nOne of the primary reasons for my skepticism regarding Palantir\u2019s ability to sustain its bullish momentum after the Q3 results is the extremely high valuation multiples at which the company trades.\nCurrently, Palantir is valued at metrics such as 35 times its forward sales, 120 times its forward earnings, and 135 times its cash flows. This valuation makes Nvidia\u2014arguably the biggest leader in AI\u2014appear relatively discounted by comparison despite being considered an expensive stock and despite Nvidia\u2019s higher growth projections for both revenue and earnings.\nThe situation is exacerbated by growth estimates that do not seem robust enough to justify such stretched multiples. Palantir\u2019s revenue is projected to grow at a forward rate of 20.4%, surpassing the sector median of 6%. For 2025, revenue is expected to grow by approximately 21.2%, followed by 20% through 2026. EPS growth is forecasted at 42.3% in 2024 with an expected EPS of $0.36, and a more moderate 21.4% in 2025, reaching an estimated $0.43. By 2026, EPS could reach $0.52, indicating growth rates of 42%, 21%, and approximately 19% over the three-year period.\nWhere Palantir\u2019s Bulls May Justify Current Prices\nA key bullish argument for Palantir\u2019s valuation is its improved free cash flow, which rose from a negative $308.9 million in 2020 to a projected range of $800 million to $1 billion, according to the company\u2019s guidance. At the midpoint of this guidance, free cash flow is roughly three times higher than Wall Street\u2019s net income consensus of $297 million, based on EPS projections. This indicates that Palantir is becoming more profitable and generating enough cash to sustain and expand its operations.\nSometimes, a business can actually be a better investment at a higher price when there\u2019s more clarity regarding management and the path to profitability, especially for those in the early stages of growth. In Palantir\u2019s case, each quarter has provided more insight, with expectations consistently being revised upward. This is why, despite the stock\u2019s stretched valuation metrics, an upward revision of the annual guidance could still lead to a significant increase in the share price.\nPalantir\u2019s Insider Selling Raises Concerns\nA troubling sign is that even Palantir\u2019s management\u2014who know the company best\u2014are selling shares rather than buying at these prices.\nCEO Alex Karp sold approximately 8.7 million Palantir shares worth over $300 million under a trading plan, while co-founder Peter Thiel also initiated a trading plan to sell shares valued at $28.5 million, totaling nearly $1 billion. Of course, there are various reasons insiders sell their shares, but it\u2019s hard to believe they would be selling now if they anticipated continued rapid stock growth in the short to medium term.\nUsing the TipRanks Insider Transactions tool, we can see that insiders are selling a larger quantity of PLTR stock compared to what is being bought.\nIs PLTR A Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\nAt TipRanks, analysts rate PTLR stock as a Hold, with six out of 16 analysts issuing neutral recommendations, another six providing bearish ratings, and only four offering bullish outlooks. The average PLTR price target is $27.67, indicating a downside potential of 36.21%.\nSee more PLTR analyst ratings\nKey Takeaway\nI rate Palantir as a Hold ahead of its Q3 earnings report. While the company has made solid progress this year, I\u2019m concerned that its triple-digit growth and high valuation multiples could hinder its performance in the upcoming quarter, potentially dampening the bullish momentum.\nGiven the significant hype surrounding the stock, simply meeting the upper end of estimates won\u2019t suffice. An upward revision of guidance is necessary to convincingly show how its growth story justifies the staggering triple-digit earnings and cash flow valuation multiples.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about.\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech.\nCramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted.\n\u201c... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.\u201d\nCramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day\u2019s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn\u2019t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts.\n\u201cSee, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.\u201d\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\nHe addressed the \u201calleged earnings disappointment,\u201d clarifying that he chose the term \u201calleged\u201d because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts.\nStory Continues\nHe reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment.\nConcluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked:\n\u201cBut the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nCramer mentioned that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock did not see the same gains as some of its Mag 7 peers on Tuesday and went on to talk about Huang\u2019s \u201csovereign AI\u201d idea.\n\u201cNVIDIA didn't get much love either, but CEO Jensen Huang is headed to India for a fireside chat at an AI conference. Hey, maybe he'll announce a giant sovereign state contract, something he's been hinting at. I would own, not trade\u2026 Nvidia.\u201d\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has established a commanding presence in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, significantly driven by its A100 and H100 chipsets. These products have been key contributors to the company's remarkable revenue and profit growth in recent years. With the introduction of the new Blackwell series GPUs, the company is positioned to strengthen its product lineup even further. CEO Jensen Huang has expressed enthusiasm regarding the overwhelming demand for Blackwell, highlighting the eagerness among many to engage with this innovative technology.\nSovereign AI refers to a nation's ability to develop artificial intelligence utilizing its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks. It highlights a country's control over its data and the AI it generates.\nDuring a speech at the World Government Summit in Dubai in June, Huang emphasized the necessity for countries to develop their own artificial intelligence infrastructure to fully harness economic potential while preserving cultural identity. He remarked that NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is working to democratize access to AI, enabling rapid advancements in AI computing. Huang stated, \u201cThe rest of it is really up to you to take initiative, activate your industry, build the infrastructure, as fast as you can.\u201d\nIn October, Huang joined the King of Denmark to unveil the nation\u2019s largest sovereign AI supercomputer, aimed at facilitating advancements in areas such as quantum computing, clean energy, and biotechnology. Named Gefion, after a figure from Danish mythology, this supercomputer is powered by 1,528 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and employs NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking for connectivity.\nAt a recent NVIDIA AI Summit, Huang also commended India's progress in artificial intelligence. He noted that over 2,000 AI companies in India are currently part of NVIDIA's incubation program, alongside more than 100,000 developers trained in AI.\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a is an American multinational corporation and technology company engineering the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future. The company has been the main beneficiary of the AI boom, with its advanced Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) that specialize in supercomputing capabilities supporting generative AI training. Back in March, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced its most powerful Blackwell chips, capable of processing trillion-parameter AI models up to 30 times faster and using one-fourth of power. The chips were supposed to be shipped in the second quarter but were delayed, impacting major tech customers in the process. On Wednesday, October 23, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that there was a design flaw with its latest Blackwell AI chips that led to production and shipping delays. The design flaw has now been fixed. The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor, to resolve the holdup.\n\u201cIt was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low. It was 100% Nvidia\u2019s fault.\u201d\nAs per Huang, the complexity of the project contributed to the setback, since there were new chips that needed to be designed and put into production simultaneously. Taiwan Semiconductor helped recover from the yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell. The CEO says that the chips will now ship in the fourth quarter.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nTesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company\u2019s quarterly results with a flurry of buying.\nA 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d counterparts \u2014 and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began.\nThat means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there\u2019s one chart that encompasses 2024\u2019s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out.\nFor example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic \u2014 significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week\u2019s gains.\nZooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla\u2019s membership in this informal \u2014 but important \u2014 cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year.\nPerhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark \u2014 who\u2019s above it and who\u2019s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors.\nNvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies \u2014 30% of the index \u2014 that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market\u2019s broadening and rotation.\nSince the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek\u2019s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven.\n\u201cIf one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cOur own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.\u201d\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

However, I feel it\u2019s too early to invest in IBM for quantum potential, especially given the stock\u2019s valuation. I\u2019m neutral on this rather expensive stock.\nExamining IBM\u2019s Growth Amid AI Excitement\nIBM, founded in 1911, is a multinational technology corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York. Its positioning in the information technology segment predates pretty much all of its big tech peers, showcasing decades of leadership in hardware and enterprise solutions.\nIn light of this history,\u00a0the company\u2019s stock has risen significantly over the past 12 months\u2014over 70% at the time of writing\u2014largely fueled by excitement around artificial intelligence (AI), as investors have ploughed into stocks with exposure or potential exposure to AI.\nHowever,\u00a0IBM\u2019s performance had broadly impressed investors until the Q3 results released on October 23. For example, IBM\u2019s recurring revenue, represented by an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of $14.1 billion, grew by 9% year-over-year in Q2, outpacing overall revenue growth of 4%. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s software segment saw an 8% increase in revenue to $6.7 billion, indicating potential for future growth as it becomes a larger part of overall sales.\nMoreover,\u00a0these prospects are compounded by the hybrid cloud market, which is expected to grow significantly, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.4% from 2025 to 2033.\u00a0Yet, despite these positive indicators,\u00a0IBM\u2019s stock surge appears more driven by AI hype than by substantial changes in its fundamental business performance.\nIs IBM\u2019s AI Hype Overstated?\nPersonally, I\u2019m concerned that IBM\u2019s exposure to AI might be overstated. While IBM has reported growth in its generative AI business, with a book of business reaching over $2 billion since the launch of watsonx, this figure is small compared to its total trailing twelve-month revenue of $62.36 billion. The company\u2019s AI-related revenues represent a fraction of its overall business.\nMoreover, revenue growth certainly isn\u2019t groundbreaking. The 9% ARR year-over-year growth in Q2 was followed by just 1% growth in total revenue in Q3. This suggests that IBM is not yet positioned as a true software-centric company that could justify a higher valuation based solely on AI capabilities.\nStory Continues\nHowever, that\u2019s not to say IBM\u2019s AI advancements, including Granite 3.0 and Red Hat OpenShift AI, won\u2019t contribute to future growth, particularly in the consulting business. These technologies enhance IBM\u2019s capability to offer sophisticated AI solutions tailored to enterprise needs. By integrating these advancements into its consulting services, IBM can better support clients\u2019 digital transformation efforts and potentially leverage additional growth.\nWill IMB Lead in Quantum Computing?\nOne area I\u2019m particularly interested in is quantum computing. Quantum computing promises to unlock vast computing potential due to something called superposition \u2014 the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at one time. In short, it means that vast calculations can be computed in almost no time at all. The problem is, the technology isn\u2019t quite there yet.\nIn this context, IBM is well-positioned to become a dominant player in the quantum computing industry, having invested billions in research. The company is actively involved in significant quantum research projects, such as the Fermilab-led initiative, which focuses on developing superconducting quantum systems.\nMoreover, the global quantum computing market is expected to grow significantly, with projections indicating an increase from $1.21 billion in 2023 to $12.62 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.8%. This rapid pace of growth presents opportunities for companies that can master the technology and deliver commercially viable solutions.\nOn the other hand, IBM faces competition from a growing ecosystem of quantum investors, including players like Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Additionally, smaller companies, such as IonQ, are investing heavily in producing early quantum solutions.\nDoes this Justify IBM\u2019s Expensive Valuation?\nI\u2019m concerned that IBM is expensive relative to its expected growth. The stock currently trades at 22.8x forward earnings, representing a 4.8% discount to the information technology sector as a whole. However, IBM\u2019s expected earnings growth is below the industry average, with a CAGR of just 5.2% compared to the industry average of 14.8%.\nCollectively, this results in a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 4.43. Even when we account for the forward dividend yield of 2.9%, the stock still appears expensive. As such, IBM seems priced according to unrealized potential, whether in AI or quantum computing. Personally, I think this makes it a risky bet.\nIs IBM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nOn TipRanks, IBM comes in as a Hold based on five Buys, seven Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The\u00a0average IBM stock price target\u00a0is $227.38, implying an upside potential of 4%.\nSee more IBM analyst ratings\nThe Bottom Line on IBM Stock\nOn paper, IBM doesn\u2019t look like a great value. The company trades above its share price target, and its PEG ratio is quite off-putting, even when dividends are taken into account. There\u2019s, of course, potential in the highly exciting AI and quantum computing segments. However, I\u2019d argue that the price tag is currently too high to take the plunge and invest.\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about.\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech.\nCramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted.\n\u201c... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.\u201d\nCramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day\u2019s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn\u2019t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts.\n\u201cSee, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.\u201d\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\nHe addressed the \u201calleged earnings disappointment,\u201d clarifying that he chose the term \u201calleged\u201d because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts.\nStory Continues\nHe reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment.\nConcluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked:\n\u201cBut the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nCramer discussed how big companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remained largely unaffected by the events of the bond market and highlighted its advertising capabilities. Here\u2019s what Mad Money\u2019s host had to say:\n\u201cThey like Google for the same reason they like Amazon and Meta, targeted ads. Referenced again and again as a place to advertise pretty much anything.\u201d\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) serves as the holding company established following Google's restructuring in 2015, with Google recognized primarily for its leading search engine. The company benefits from strong network effects, as the value of its Google Search platform increases for all stakeholders, users, website publishers, and advertisers, as it expands.\nAccording to CEO Sundar Pichai, the introduction of generative AI features has led to greater engagement and satisfaction among users, particularly those aged 18 to 24. The innovation includes AI-driven tools aimed at optimizing advertising profits and automating the creation of media content and advertising campaigns.\nAs a major player in the digital advertising industry, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) sees substantial gains from its successful Google Search platform, which accounted for more than half of the company's $84.7 billion in revenue during the second quarter. Each of the primary operating segments contributed to these strong results, but the resurgence in advertising revenue had a significant impact after a challenging period in recent years. Google advertising rose by 11% year over year, which points to a recovery in its advertising business.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Tesla TSLA kicked off the Q3 reporting cycle for the Magnificent 7 companies in style, with significant gains on the margins front raising hopes that competitive pressures may have started to ease. Tesla\u2019s issues have always been unique, not providing any read-through to the five Mag 7 peers that are coming out with Q3 results this week.\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q3 earnings season, with more than 800 companies reporting results, including 168 S&P 500 members. Of the Mag 7 members, we have Alphabet GOOGL on Tuesday, October 29th, Meta META, and Microsoft MSFT on Wednesday, October 30th, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL on Thursday, October 31st.\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market\u2019s disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. But the stock is still the Mag 7 laggard this year, as the chart below shows.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla\u2019s margin gains are particularly notable in this quarterly release, but it is perhaps premature to assume that the margin pressures are now behind them. There is some talk that maybe a bigger proportion of this quarter\u2019s deliveries came from the high-margin Shanghai factory. Part of the gains may also have resulted from production tax credits related to Tesla\u2019s battery production.\nShould Tesla\u2019s Q3 margin gains prove durable, then we can reasonably expect extrapolation of the same into the coming quarters. The table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q3 net margins of 8.7% up from 5.8% in the preceding period and 7.9% in the year-earlier period.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet shares were down in response to the last earnings report on July 23rd even though the company had handily beaten consensus EPS and revenue estimates. If we look at the stock\u2019s performance since July 22nd, the day before the Q2 earnings release, Alphabet shares are down -9.3%, which compares to a +1.1% gain for the Zacks Tech sector and a\u00a0+3.9% gain for the S&P 500 index.\nGiven this performance despite strong results, we can reasonably opine that the market will remain unimpressed with this report as well unless management can make a compelling case for its ever-rising AI-centric spending plans. Investors\u2019 worries increased due to management\u2019s comment during the Q2 earnings call that the risk on the capex question was more about under-investing\u00a0than the alternative.\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Alphabet alone, as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. But the issue is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. This likely explains why Alphabet shares have lagged Microsoft and Amazon over the last three months, as the chart below shows.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +16.9% more earnings in Q3 relative to the same period last year on +13.3% higher revenues.\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n2024 has been a big year for AI breakthroughs, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Generative AI has arguably been the biggest trend, with McKinsey estimating that it could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries annually, based on 63 use cases they analyzed. Back in 2022, when OpenAI launched its free web app, ChatGPT, few could have predicted the scale of the AI revolution that would follow. Major tech giants have since followed suit, revealing their own chatbot-based assistants, AI-enabled phones, and much more.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and\u00a020 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\nAs AI continues to revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries to new heights, today\u2019s headlines reveal just how impactful these advancements can be. The question of the hour is, with all of these big AI breakthroughs, are regulators finally catching up with developers working on their next big AI projects? Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the company behind Google. Google offers a vast array of sophisticated artificial intelligence products, solutions, and applications on a trusted cloud platform, enabling businesses to build and implement AI algorithms and models. Its AI product lineup features consumer-focused solutions like Google One AI Premium and Gemini, alongside developer tools such as Gemini models.\nOn October 23, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s Google reported that Google DeepMind has developed a tool for identifying AI-generated text and that it is making it available open source. SynthID, the new tool, is a member of a larger family of watermarking tools for generative AI outputs. Watermarks are an important way of letting people determine whether something is AI-generated, allowing people to counter harms such as misinformation.\nThe new tool can be downloaded from the AI platform Hugging Face, or Google\u2019s updated Responsible GenAI Toolkit.\n\u201cWe\u2019re open-sourcing our SynthID Text watermarking tool. Available freely to developers and businesses, it will help them identify their AI-generated content.\u201d\nAccording to Google, SynthID Text will not compromise the quality, speed, or accuracy of text generation. It will even work on text that has been cropped, modified, or paraphrased. However, the company also reports that it has some limitations. For instance, SynthID Text doesn\u2019t perform well on short text, responses to factual questions, or text that has been rewritten or translated from another language. Considering such watermarking techniques are widely implemented, they can help counteract inaccurate AI detectors prevalent today.\n\u201cNow, other [generative] AI developers will be able to use this technology to help them detect whether text outputs have come from their own [large language models], making it easier for more developers to build AI responsibly\u201d.\nOverall GOOG ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Next week, three of the biggest names in tech are set to report earnings, and investors will be watching closely. Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL) remain stalwarts of this market, and their quarterly earning reports not only affect their stock prices but also the broader market.\nDuring this year we have seen an interesting divergence in performance among these stocks, although even the worst performer, Alphabet, has still put up a decent return. Meta Platforms has been the clear outperformer year-to-date (YTD) more than tripling the returns of the others and Apple has slightly underperformed the market.\nThe near-term outlooks for these companies are also varied, although frankly, their business supremacy is still evident, and the long-term outlooks are still very bright in my opinion. Let\u2019s dive deeper into the details below.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta Platforms: Strong Outlook for the Stock\nMeta Platforms has been one of the best performing stocks in the market since the 2022 bear market. In terms of large cap stocks, only Nvidia has been better. Over the last two years META stock has rallied an incredible 346%. But that strong performance shouldn\u2019t shake investors\u2019 confidence, because it seems likely that the stock will continue to perform well.\nMETA enjoys numerous bullish catalysts that should make the stock a must watch. Currently, it enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.83%. Earnings are forecast to grow at an impressive 19.15% annually over the next three to five years, while the company also has a reasonable valuation of 26.5x forward earnings, just above the market average.\nLooking at META\u2019s stock chart, I also see a compelling technical setup. We can see just a few weeks ago the stock broke out from a clear bull flag, which sent it to new record highs. Today, there is a very similar pattern building. If the stock can break out above the $580 level, it should send it again to new highs. However, the market may wait until the earnings report to make the move.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nAlphabet: Cheapest Stock Among the Group\nAlthough Alphabet stock has struggled this year when compared to Apple, Meta and the broad market, it remains one of the premier assets in the market. Its entrenched business model and growth catalysts, combined with a relatively cheap valuation, make it a must watch stock as well. GOOGL also enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.\nStory Continues\nThe growth catalysts are, I think, very exciting and surprisingly overlooked by most market participants. Self-driving cars is one of the hottest topics out there today, and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo seems to be quietly winning the race. The self-driving technology has already been deployed in several cities across the country, completing some 100,000 rides per week by partnering with Uber Technologies (UBER). It also seems that Waymo\u2019s technology, which uses a suite of sensors, rather than camera\u2019s, is a superior approach. This approach will also give it a business advantage as it may be able to be implemented through software, rather than having to develop entire vehicles.\nWhat is crazy to me is that even with these factors, GOOGL trades at a forward earnings multiple of 21.3x, below the market average and its 10-year median of 25.8x. It also forecasts earnings to grow 17.2% annually over the next three to five years. Finally, its Zacks Earnings ESP is 0.4%, meaning it is expected to beat earnings estimates slightly at the next report.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple: Steady Growth, But AI Could Push the Stock Higher\nApple, of course one of the great stocks and companies of the world, has a slightly worse near-term outlook than the other two. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating and a worrying Zacks Earnings ESP of -17.7%. It also has the richest valuation at 30.6x forward earnings, and the lowest earnings growth projections, at 12.7% annual growth over the next three to five years.\nHowever, you should never count this stock out. Because Apple\u2019s products are so widely used, its foray into AI may become the most effective and widely used option out there. Apple Intelligence will enhance user experiences in areas like Siri, camera capabilities, health monitoring, and app functionalities, making its devices even smarter and more intuitive. I believe every incremental improvement in its products further increases our reliance on the product, deepens its moat and improves selling points.\nEspecially notable is the technical setup in AAPL stock. Although we have seen the price action trade in a sideways and volatile manner over the last four months, it has formed a very large and compelling bull flag. I would not be surprised if Apple surprised investors at its upcoming earnings and blasted higher through the breakout level. However, investors should be cautious here, as we noted the risks which could easily send the stock through the support level as well.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy AAPL, GOOGL and META Shares?\nWhile each of these tech giants faces unique challenges, their long-term growth prospects remain strong. Meta\u2019s robust earnings growth and favorable technical setup make it an intriguing opportunity, especially if it breaks out above key levels. Alphabet stands out for its relatively low valuation and the potential of Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology to drive future growth. Apple, despite near-term concerns, could see upside if its AI initiatives boost user engagement and enhance product capabilities.\nIt is always hard to say if investors should buy a stock before earnings, because the results are difficult to predict, and the stocks can be extremely volatile. Nonetheless, each of these stocks offers compelling long-term opportunity and can fit into nearly any investors portfolio.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rowe Price Group and others, Waymo said in a statement on Friday.\nWaymo is one of a large pack of companies pursuing robotaxi services in the US. It runs a commercial ridehailing platform in San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles, where it charges fares for trips in self-driving cars. Waymo also recently partnered with Uber Technologies Inc. to offer rides through its app in new markets Austin and Atlanta, starting next year.\nEarlier this year, Alphabet pledged to invest as much as $5 billion over several years to help the startup build its autonomous driving technology. Waymo didn\u2019t specify how much of this round Alphabet accounted for. Waymo\u2019s valuation was not disclosed.\nAlphabet shares were up 1.5% to $165.10 at 11:14 a.m. Friday in New York.\nWaymo raised $2.25 billion in 2020, marking the first time it accepted outside investment. The funding was led by private equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, which also participated in the latest round. The company raised another $2.5 billion in 2021.\nBy taking outside capital, Alphabet is hedging its risk of going all-in on autonomous driving, an industry that will likely face regulatory hurdles as it grows. It also faces fierce competition with Tesla Inc. to dominate the growing multibillion-dollar market. Earlier this month, Tesla\u2019s stock fell as much as 10% after an event previewing its own robotaxis was poorly received.\n\u201cThe funding probably carries Waymo all the way to a public listing where it would join several other autonomous vehicle rivals,\u201d BloombergNEF analyst Andrew Grant said. Those rivals include the Chinese firms WeRide, which made its Nasdaq debut on Friday, and Pony AI Inc., which has filed for a US initial public offering.\nWaymo\u2019s current fleet of retrofitted Jaguar EVs will soon grow to include Hyundai Motor Co. EVs with built-in autonomous driving technology made at the Korean automaker\u2019s new plant in Georgia.\nWaymo cars provide more than 100,000 rides each week, according to the company.

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nTesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company\u2019s quarterly results with a flurry of buying.\nA 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d counterparts \u2014 and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began.\nThat means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there\u2019s one chart that encompasses 2024\u2019s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out.\nFor example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic \u2014 significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week\u2019s gains.\nZooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla\u2019s membership in this informal \u2014 but important \u2014 cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year.\nPerhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark \u2014 who\u2019s above it and who\u2019s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors.\nNvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies \u2014 30% of the index \u2014 that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market\u2019s broadening and rotation.\nSince the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek\u2019s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven.\n\u201cIf one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cOur own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.\u201d\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

          "whole_article": "IBM \u2014 International Business Machines Corporation \u2014 (IBM) stock has surged in 2024, outpacing the rest of the market and beating many of its sector peers. Investors appear buoyed by the company\u2019s potential in artificial intelligence (AI), but this \u201cpotential\u201d isn\u2019t currently reflected in earnings forecasts. Quantum computing represents another area of great potential, and one where IBM has invested heavily. However, I feel it\u2019s too early to invest in IBM for quantum potential, especially given the stock\u2019s valuation. I\u2019m neutral on this rather expensive stock.\nExamining IBM\u2019s Growth Amid AI Excitement\nIBM, founded in 1911, is a multinational technology corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York. Its positioning in the information technology segment predates pretty much all of its big tech peers, showcasing decades of leadership in hardware and enterprise solutions.\nIn light of this history,\u00a0the company\u2019s stock has risen significantly over the past 12 months\u2014over 70% at the time of writing\u2014largely fueled by excitement around artificial intelligence (AI), as investors have ploughed into stocks with exposure or potential exposure to AI.\nHowever,\u00a0IBM\u2019s performance had broadly impressed investors until the Q3 results released on October 23. For example, IBM\u2019s recurring revenue, represented by an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of $14.1 billion, grew by 9% year-over-year in Q2, outpacing overall revenue growth of 4%. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s software segment saw an 8% increase in revenue to $6.7 billion, indicating potential for future growth as it becomes a larger part of overall sales.\nMoreover,\u00a0these prospects are compounded by the hybrid cloud market, which is expected to grow significantly, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.4% from 2025 to 2033.\u00a0Yet, despite these positive indicators,\u00a0IBM\u2019s stock surge appears more driven by AI hype than by substantial changes in its fundamental business performance.\nIs IBM\u2019s AI Hype Overstated?\nPersonally, I\u2019m concerned that IBM\u2019s exposure to AI might be overstated. While IBM has reported growth in its generative AI business, with a book of business reaching over $2 billion since the launch of watsonx, this figure is small compared to its total trailing twelve-month revenue of $62.36 billion. The company\u2019s AI-related revenues represent a fraction of its overall business.\nMoreover, revenue growth certainly isn\u2019t groundbreaking. The 9% ARR year-over-year growth in Q2 was followed by just 1% growth in total revenue in Q3. This suggests that IBM is not yet positioned as a true software-centric company that could justify a higher valuation based solely on AI capabilities.\nStory Continues\nHowever, that\u2019s not to say IBM\u2019s AI advancements, including Granite 3.0 and Red Hat OpenShift AI, won\u2019t contribute to future growth, particularly in the consulting business. These technologies enhance IBM\u2019s capability to offer sophisticated AI solutions tailored to enterprise needs. By integrating these advancements into its consulting services, IBM can better support clients\u2019 digital transformation efforts and potentially leverage additional growth.\nWill IMB Lead in Quantum Computing?\nOne area I\u2019m particularly interested in is quantum computing. Quantum computing promises to unlock vast computing potential due to something called superposition \u2014 the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at one time. In short, it means that vast calculations can be computed in almost no time at all. The problem is, the technology isn\u2019t quite there yet.\nIn this context, IBM is well-positioned to become a dominant player in the quantum computing industry, having invested billions in research. The company is actively involved in significant quantum research projects, such as the Fermilab-led initiative, which focuses on developing superconducting quantum systems.\nMoreover, the global quantum computing market is expected to grow significantly, with projections indicating an increase from $1.21 billion in 2023 to $12.62 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.8%. This rapid pace of growth presents opportunities for companies that can master the technology and deliver commercially viable solutions.\nOn the other hand, IBM faces competition from a growing ecosystem of quantum investors, including players like Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Additionally, smaller companies, such as IonQ, are investing heavily in producing early quantum solutions.\nDoes this Justify IBM\u2019s Expensive Valuation?\nI\u2019m concerned that IBM is expensive relative to its expected growth. The stock currently trades at 22.8x forward earnings, representing a 4.8% discount to the information technology sector as a whole. However, IBM\u2019s expected earnings growth is below the industry average, with a CAGR of just 5.2% compared to the industry average of 14.8%.\nCollectively, this results in a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 4.43. Even when we account for the forward dividend yield of 2.9%, the stock still appears expensive. As such, IBM seems priced according to unrealized potential, whether in AI or quantum computing. Personally, I think this makes it a risky bet.\nIs IBM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nOn TipRanks, IBM comes in as a Hold based on five Buys, seven Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The\u00a0average IBM stock price target\u00a0is $227.38, implying an upside potential of 4%.\nSee more IBM analyst ratings\nThe Bottom Line on IBM Stock\nOn paper, IBM doesn\u2019t look like a great value. The company trades above its share price target, and its PEG ratio is quite off-putting, even when dividends are taken into account. There\u2019s, of course, potential in the highly exciting AI and quantum computing segments. However, I\u2019d argue that the price tag is currently too high to take the plunge and invest.\nView Comments"

But they contended that Thursday's event was similar to other Microsoft-sanctioned employee giving campaigns for people in need.\n\u201cWe have so many community members within Microsoft who have lost family, lost friends or loved ones,\u201d said Abdo Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist. \"But Microsoft really failed to have the space for us where we can come together and share our grief and honor the memories of people who can no longer speak for themselves.\"\nMicrosoft said Friday it has \u201cended the employment of some individuals in accordance with internal policy\u201d but declined to provide details.\nMohamed, who is from Egypt, said he now needs a new job in the next two months to transfer a work visa and avoid deportation.\nAnother fired worker, Hossam Nasr, said the purpose of the vigil was both \u201cto honor the victims of the Palestinian genocide in Gaza and to call attention to Microsoft\u2019s complicity in the genocide\u201d because of the use of its technology by the Israeli military.\nNasr said his firing was disclosed on social media by the watchdog group Stop Antisemitism more than an hour before he received the call from Microsoft. The group didn't immediately respond Friday to a request for comment on how it learned about the firing.\nThe same group had months earlier called on Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to take action against Nasr for his public stances on Israel.\nNasr, an Egyptian-raised 2021 graduate of Harvard University, is also a co-organizer of Harvard Alumni for Palestine.\nGoogle earlier this year fired more than 50 workers in the aftermath of protests over technology the company is supplying the Israeli government amid the Gaza war. The firings stemmed from internal turmoil and sit-in protests at Google offices centered on \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 for Google and Amazon to provide the Israeli government with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services.\nMicrosoft said in its statement Friday about the firings that it remains \u201cdedicated to maintaining a professional and respectful work environment.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about.\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech.\nCramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted.\n\u201c... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.\u201d\nCramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day\u2019s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn\u2019t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts.\n\u201cSee, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.\u201d\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\nHe addressed the \u201calleged earnings disappointment,\u201d clarifying that he chose the term \u201calleged\u201d because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts.\nStory Continues\nHe reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment.\nConcluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked:\n\u201cBut the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nCramer praised Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and pointed out the tech giant\u2019s solid balance sheet and customer base.\n\u201cRates don't matter all that much to Microsoft or Meta or Google. Neither they nor their clients need to borrow large sums of money so the bond markets are irrelevant to them\u2026 Microsoft started going up right at the opening bell. Here's a company with [an] amazing balance sheet, selling indispensable products to 100 millions of people around the world. People who pay on time regardless of how the economy's doing.\u201d\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) operates with a diversified business model that spans enterprise software, consumer applications, cloud services, gaming, social media, and hardware products. Its broad portfolio has contributed to significant financial success, as highlighted in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, which ended on June 30. During this period, the company reported revenue of $64.7 billion and operating income of $27.9 billion, reflecting a 15% increase in both metrics compared to the previous year.\nThe strong growth was because of several key factors, including heightened demand for Microsoft 365, the company's suite of office collaboration and productivity tools. Additionally, the revenue generated by Azure, its cloud computing platform, experienced impressive growth, further boosting overall performance. The company also noted a 9% increase in revenue from search and news advertising, illustrating its strength in the digital advertising space.\nFor the full fiscal year, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) achieved a significant milestone as cash flow from operations exceeded $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion. This financial strength allowed the company to return over $34 billion to shareholders throughout the fiscal year.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Generative AI has arguably been the biggest trend, with McKinsey estimating that it could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries annually, based on 63 use cases they analyzed. Back in 2022, when OpenAI launched its free web app, ChatGPT, few could have predicted the scale of the AI revolution that would follow. Major tech giants have since followed suit, revealing their own chatbot-based assistants, AI-enabled phones, and much more.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and\u00a020 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\nAs AI continues to revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries to new heights, today\u2019s headlines reveal just how impactful these advancements can be. The question of the hour is, with all of these big AI breakthroughs, are regulators finally catching up with developers working on their next big AI projects? Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The company's AI strategy is highlighted by its collaboration with OpenAI and the integration of AI technologies across platforms like Windows, Xbox, Microsoft 365, Teams, and Dynamics.\nOn October 22, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a new major collaboration with Open AI and the Lenfest Institute for Journalism. The collaboration between Lenfest, OpenAI, and Microsoft Corp. aims to help newsrooms explore and implement ways in which artificial intelligence can help drive business sustainability and innovation in local journalism through the Lenfest Institute AI Collaborative and Fellowship program.\nIn the first round of funding, several news organizations, including Chicago Public Media, Newsday, The Minnesota Star Tribune, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and The Seattle Times, will receive grants to hire AI fellows for two years. The fellowship will focus on enhancing business sustainability and integrating AI technologies within their respective organizations. It will also provide OpenAI and Microsoft Azure credits to help these publications experiment and develop tools to assist with local news. News like these may make it seem that AI is slowly replacing the role of journalists. However, AI can help the sector thrive.\n\u201cWhile nothing will replace the central role of reporters, we believe that AI technology can help in the research, investigation, distribution and monetization of important journalism. We\u2019re deeply invested in supporting smaller, independent publishers through initiatives like The Lenfest Institute AI Collaborative and Fellowship, ensuring they have access to the same cutting-edge tools and opportunities as larger organizations.

With Microsoft having invested nearly $14 billion in OpenAI since 2019, the question is how much of a piece of the pie Microsoft will get as OpenAI shifts gears from a nonprofit to a for-profit model.\nBoth companies have roped in the big guns \u2013 Microsoft teaming up with Morgan Stanley and OpenAI getting advice from Goldman Sachs \u2013 to hash out the details of this major negotiation.\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nThe tension goes beyond just dollars and cents. With CEO Satya Nadella at the helm, Microsoft is increasingly vocal about wanting more control, especially following recent turbulence in OpenAI's leadership.\nNadella has made it clear that Microsoft is monitoring OpenAI's governance and decision-making.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the department also would look into complaints about Delta customer service during the outage, including long waits for help and reports that unaccompanied minors were stranded at airports.\nIn its lawsuit, Delta claims that the outage occurred because CrowdStrike failed to test the update before rolling it out worldwide.\nDelta canceled about 7,000 flights over a five-day period during the peak summer vacation season.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n2024 has been a big year for AI breakthroughs, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Generative AI has arguably been the biggest trend, with McKinsey estimating that it could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries annually, based on 63 use cases they analyzed. Back in 2022, when OpenAI launched its free web app, ChatGPT, few could have predicted the scale of the AI revolution that would follow. Major tech giants have since followed suit, revealing their own chatbot-based assistants, AI-enabled phones, and much more.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and\u00a020 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\nAs AI continues to revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries to new heights, today\u2019s headlines reveal just how impactful these advancements can be. The question of the hour is, with all of these big AI breakthroughs, are regulators finally catching up with developers working on their next big AI projects? Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a global cybersecurity company that provides cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data. The company employs world-class AI and ML to detect and prevent modern threats with the speed and scale of the cloud.\nOn Tuesday, October 23, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) announced that it is partnering with Omnissa, a leading digital work platform company. The partnership aims to deliver real-time threat detection and automated remediation for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and physical desktop environments, all while improving upon customers\u2019 digital work experience and productivity. The partnership, forming amid rising worldwide security threats, aims to combine CrowdStrike's AI-based endpoint security with Fortinet's network firewall technology to handle cyber-attacks.\nWhile endpoint security helps safeguard individual devices such as computers and phones, network firewalls help regulate incoming and outgoing network traffic. The combination of the two elements helps bridge the gap through collaboration, offering a holistic approach to cybersecurity, and allowing organizations to detect and respond to threats more efficiently across their entire IT infrastructure. It is also a reflection of the growing trend in the cybersecurity industry to consolidate and integrate security tools.\nOverall CRWD ranks 9th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

It was for identity threat protection software intended for the US Internal Revenue Service, according to documents from both companies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nOman Sees an Urban Future Distinct From Dubai and Abu Dhabi\nBut the IRS never bought the software, according to records reviewed by Bloomberg News and people with knowledge of the situation.\nStill, Carahsoft has been making on-time payments on the $32 million to CrowdStrike, according to the cybersecurity firm. When asked for comment by Bloomberg News, both companies explained that they had a \u201cnon-cancellable order\u201d between them. They declined to say why that deal was struck without a purchase in place from the IRS. Shares of CrowdStrike fell as much as 2.7% after Bloomberg News reported about the deal.\nSome legal and accounting experts, who reviewed the arrangement at Bloomberg\u2019s request, said it raises red flags that merit scrutiny from regulators. The deal also raised concerns within CrowdStrike \u2014 according to people familiar with the matter and the company itself \u2013 and many specifics of the transaction remain unclear.\nDepending on how CrowdStrike accounted for the deal in financial statements \u2014 the company didn\u2019t explain those details \u2014 it was big enough that it could have made the difference between the company beating or missing Wall Street projections for the period. The day after CrowdStrike reported results for the record quarter, its shares rose 10%.\nJeremy Fielding, a spokesperson representing CrowdStrike, dismissed employees\u2019 concerns as baseless and the order\u2019s timing as insignificant. The Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm closes deals \u201cthroughout the quarter, starting the first day and often through the last day,\" he said.\nStory Continues\n\"The Carahsoft deal went through a separate and extensive review,\" he said, adding that it \"was given a clean bill of health.\" Fielding characterized the experts\u2019 comments as \u201cinaccurately speculating about a transaction that CrowdStrike confirmed fully met\u201d an accounting standard on revenue from contracts. CrowdStrike \u201cclosed and recognized\u201d the deal once Carahsoft placed the order, and its booking of the revenue is consistent with standard accounting principles, according to Thomas Clare and Elizabeth Locke, lawyers representing the cybersecurity company.\nA representative of Carahsoft, Mary Lange, said in an email, \u201cCarahsoft is a private company and we do not disclose financial information or customer details. That said, we placed a valid, non-cancellable order with CrowdStrike and stand by that transaction.\u201d The company declined to answer any other questions.\nThe IRS didn\u2019t answer detailed questions. The tax agency said in a statement that it doesn\u2019t hold any contracts with CrowdStrike directly and, in keeping with federal procurement rules, acquires its software and services through third-party vendors.\nNo IRS contract or payments matching the deal appear in the public government spending database USASPENDING.gov. The database excludes some information \u2014 for instance, material that could compromise national security. But the tax agency\u2019s purchases of CrowdStrike\u2019s products through vendors total less than $10 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.This story is based on records of the transaction and interviews with five people familiar with the matter, who requested that their names not be published because they aren\u2019t authorized to discuss it.\n\u201cIt raises an eyebrow,\u201d said Lawrence Cunningham, director of the University of Delaware\u2019s John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance.\n\u201cIt appears on its face to be uncompensated risk, and rational businesses don\u2019t usually accept uncompensated risk,\u201d Cunningham said, referring to Carahsoft\u2019s payments to CrowdStrike.\nCarahsoft declined to answer questions about whether it was taking a loss on the deal or if it found a way to recoup the money.\nIn recent months, separate issues at CrowdStrike and Carahsoft have drawn negative attention and government scrutiny.\nCrowdStrike, with annual revenues of more than $3 billion, sells security software to thousands of businesses and government agencies globally. But in July, a flawed update from the firm knocked out millions of Windows computers around the world, disrupting air travel, medical care, banks and other businesses. Executives have apologized repeatedly, including before members of Congress; the company\u2019s share price plummeted after the outage and hasn\u2019t fully recovered.\nCarahsoft is a dominant player among resellers and distributors that help technology companies navigate the complexities of selling to government agencies. In September, agents from the FBI and the US Department of Defense searched the company\u2019s Reston, Virginia, headquarters. Lange, the Carahsoft spokesperson, previously said the company was cooperating with the FBI probe and that it involved \u201can investigation into a company with which Carahsoft has done business in the past.\u201d The Justice Department is also conducting a civil probe of Carahsoft and software giant SAP SE for potential price fixing on government contracts. The German firm is cooperating with the civil probe, a spokesperson said. SAP Chief Financial Officer Dominik Asam told Bloomberg News that SAP had \u201cgotten written assurance from Carahsoft\u201d that the FBI search was \u201centirely unrelated\u201d to SAP and a US subsidiary.\nThere\u2019s no known link between CrowdStrike and either the civil investigation or search of Carahsoft\u2019s office. Fielding, the CrowdStrike representative, said neither investigation is connected to the cybersecurity company.A potential deal for the IRS dates to early 2023, when CrowdStrike sales representatives began talking with agency officials about buying an identity verification tool to help prevent fraud in a new program that lets people file their taxes directly with the government, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nWork continued on a potential deal in the following months, but by mid-October it had become clear to at least some CrowdStrike staff that the IRS wouldn\u2019t order the software before the company\u2019s quarter closed at the end of the month, the people said.\nNevertheless, on Halloween, Carahsoft ordered $32.25 million worth of subscription access to CrowdStrike\u2019s \u201cGovernment National Identity Threat Protection\u201d service for as many as 40 million users, according to records and two of the people. The order split the purchase into four $8 million payments, with the final payment due at the end of this October. The order indicates that Carahsoft should be billed for the CrowdStrike software and that it should be shipped to the IRS\u2019s Washington headquarters.\nThat day, CrowdStrike sent an automated email to dozens of staff, saying, \u201cOpportunity has been Closed Won for Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\u201d\nThe closing of the deal and Kurtz referring to it on the earnings call alarmed some staff who raised internal concerns that CrowdStrike was \u201cpre-booking\u201d a transaction that they viewed as incomplete because it was unclear whether the IRS would ever make the large purchase, according to three of the people. US regulators have in some cases sued and fined companies over alleged pre-booking, also known as channel stuffing, claiming they misled investors by improperly recognizing revenue to inflate their financial figures.\nFielding said it was \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d that there was any pre-booking.\nThat quarter, $32 million was enough to make the difference between CrowdStrike beating analysts\u2019 expectations on two key financial metrics \u2014 annual recurring revenue and net new annual recurring revenue \u2014 or falling short of them. CrowdStrike highlighted both metrics in the earnings announcement for the quarter, but the company declined to answer questions about whether the deal was recorded under them.\nAnnual recurring revenue is widely used by software companies to track income from subscriptions. CrowdStrike has consistently emphasized it with investors, writing in a 2019 regulatory filing that it \u201cis a key metric to measure our business.\u201d\nTheresa Gabaldon, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, said that for CrowdStrike to appropriately book the deal as revenue it would need to have not only received payment but also delivered the product. Neither CrowdStrike nor Carahsoft answered questions about what became of the subscription software.\n\u201cI characterize it as raising red flags,\u201d Gabaldon, who teaches securities regulation, law and accounting, said of the deal.\nWhatever happened, Carahsoft was among the companies that CrowdStrike feted at a June \u201cpartner symposium.\u201d There, Kurtz and other CrowdStrike staff mingled with guests at a luxury resort on the southern California coast. A video shows attendees enjoying drinks and live string music on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean and getting sushi-making lessons from a celebrity chef.\nAt the event, CrowdStrike named Carahsoft \u201cDistributor of the Year.\u201d\n--With assistance from Charles Gorrivan.\n(Updates with CrowdStrike share drop in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

It is clear the company will see increased scrutiny on deals, including the implementation of a new incentive program offering customers short-term discounts, free products, and billing flexibility, which will negatively impact bookings, revenue, and cash flow over the near term. However, we came away from our diligence believing CrowdStrike can retain its premium brand and likely emerges stronger over the next year and beyond.\"\nStory Continues\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

In this article, I will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to explain why, despite my bullish stance on both stocks, I believe Mastercard has a slight advantage heading into earnings day, making it the better buy.\nVisa\u2019s Fiscal Q3 Recap\nDespite Visa\u2019s underwhelming Q3 results reported in July, my long-term bullish thesis remains intact, even though the report raised some cautionary flags. Visa delivered an EPS of $2.42, which met estimates. However, the company reported revenue of $8.9 billion, slightly missing analysts\u2019 expectations of $8.924 billion. Still, this figure represents a 9.6% increase from the $8.12 billion reported a year earlier.\nGrowth was fueled by an increase in cards in circulation, rising from 4.1 billion to 4.5 billion, which boosted transactions and transaction volume. Visa processed 59.32 billion transactions during Q3, a 9.8% increase from 54.03 billion in the same period last year, resulting in a payments volume of $3.78 trillion for the quarter.\nDespite initial market pessimism following Visa\u2019s Q3 earnings call, the stock has risen by around 12% since then. This performance came despite three Wall Street analysts lowering their price targets, offset by one upgrade and two price target increases.\nHow Fiscal Q4 Is Shaping Up for Visa\nOne of my concerns about adopting an ultra-bullish stance ahead of Visa\u2019s earnings is the potential for Q4 to be weaker than anticipated. In its earnings call, Visa\u2019s management indicated that the outlook for upcoming quarters, including Q4, could be slightly softer due to external factors such as a hurricane affecting parts of Texas, a cyber outage from CrowdStrike (CRWD), and various macroeconomic pressures.\nManagement also stated that Q4 non-GAAP revenue should grow at a low double-digit rate, with a 10% growth translating to approximately $9.47 billion. Wall Street\u2019s consensus is slightly higher at $9.48 billion, reflecting 10.25% growth, despite 19 of 21 analysts revising estimates downward in the past three months. For EPS, Visa guided for high single-digit growth, with analysts expecting $2.58, implying 10.8% annual growth.\nBeyond topping analyst\u2019s expectations, a key focus for Visa\u2019s upcoming earnings will be its progress in \u201cvalue-added services\u201d (VAS), a significant growth driver. In Q3, Visa generated $2.2 billion from VAS, a 23% increase, positioning the company to exceed $8 billion in VAS revenue this year. This reflects Visa\u2019s efforts to diversify its revenue streams beyond traditional swipe fees and progress in this area is likely to positively influence the stock price\u2019s reaction.\nStory Continues\nIs V a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\nLooking at Wall Street consensus, 23 out of 28 bullish analysts rate Visa Stock a Strong Buy, with an\u00a0average price target of $314.09 implying a potential upside of 10.29%.\nSee more V stock analyst ratings\nMastercard\u2019s Q2 Recap\nShifting focus to Mastercard, the second-largest credit card company globally, I hold a slightly more bullish stance on the stock ahead of its earnings. Mastercard has performed well in 2024, with shares up 21%. The company\u2019s recent quarters indicate that it is benefiting from a resilient global economic environment, which is driving steady earnings growth.\nIn Q2, Mastercard reported revenues of $7 billion, marking an 11% year-over-year increase, which exceeded the $6.85 billion consensus. The company also posted adjusted diluted EPS of $3.59, a 24% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of $3.51. However, the most notable shortcoming in the report was purchase volume, which totaled $1.97 trillion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $2.01 trillion.\nWhat likely fueled the 17% rally in Mastercard\u2019s shares after its Q2 results was CEO Michael Miebach\u2019s statement that double-digit top and bottom-line growth was driven by \u201ccontinued healthy consumer spending.\u201d This was in contrast to Visa\u2019s management, which highlighted a slight moderation in spending within the lower consumer segment in the U.S. Consequently, seven Wall Street firms raised their target prices for Mastercard, with only one reducing their estimate.\nHow Q3 Is Shaping Up for Mastercard\nWhile I\u2019m leaning more bullish on Mastercard ahead of its earnings, it\u2019s important to note that growth expectations for the September quarter are quite similar to Visa\u2019s. Mastercard\u2019s Q3 guidance anticipates low double-digit growth in non-GAAP revenues, with Wall Street projecting $7.26 billion\u2014an 11.2% year-over-year increase. The company also expects operating expenses to rise by low double digits, aligning with consensus estimates of Q3 EPS at $3.74, reflecting a 10.5% year-over-year increase.\nAlthough the bar for top-line estimates is relatively high, with 17 out of 19 analysts raising their projections in the last three months, I believe there is minimal risk of Mastercard missing revenue expectations\u2014something it hasn\u2019t done since Q3 2020\u2014unlike Visa, which missed last quarter.\nMoreover, the recent Fed rate cut has likely supported both Mastercard and Visa shares by boosting card usage activity, which may be better reflected in Q3 results. Another significant factor that could drive Mastercard\u2019s stock higher is its international performance, with gross dollar volume (GDV) growing 9% year-over-year in Q2, compared to 6% growth in the U.S. This outpaced Visa\u2019s 5% growth in both the U.S. and internationally, potentially explaining Mastercard\u2019s outperformance relative to Visa throughout the year.\nIs MA a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\nThe Wall Street consensus on Mastercard is highly favorable, with 22 out of 26 analysts recommending a Buy, giving it a Strong Buy rating. The average price target of $537.54 implies a potential upside of 4.78%.\nSee more MA analyst ratings\nKey Takeaway\nWhile I have a long-term bullish outlook for both Visa and Mastercard, if I had to choose one as the better buy ahead of its earnings, I would lean toward Mastercard. Although this is a close call, I believe Mastercard has a stronger chance of exceeding estimates, given its recent earnings performance and the more confident narrative from its management regarding growth expectations amid macroeconomic challenges and on the international front.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings.

The company provides a range of security products including identity management, threat intelligence, and threat detection.\nThe company has 29,000 clients in multiple sectors including healthcare, retail, technology, and the government, reflecting its strong position in the market.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) has recently closed crucial partnerships, added innovations to its Falcon Platform, and expanded its CrowdStrike Marketplace to meet the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions.\nDespite the July 19 incident, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been resilient and showcased transparency and accountability to its customers. However, the company must sustain its efforts towards making customers happy.\u00a0On August 28, Fatima Boolani, Citi US software equity research co-head, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss CRWD following the global outage.\u00a0She shares that CRWD management has a lot of tasks especially when it comes to rebuilding its trust among investors and managing the impact of their business impact. She adds that the company has an appetite and regaining consumer confidence should remain the primary focus. Boolani argued that since there is a lack of talent in cybersecurity, AI can potentially fill the gap, that CRWD is in the crosshairs of in a positive way.\nAs Boolani said, the market currently lacks talent in cybersecurity, giving CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\"\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.

By integrating AI-native endpoint security from the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae cybersecurity platform and Fortinet\u2019s FortiGate next-generation firewalls (NGFW), customers and partners gain the flexibility, visibility and security across networks, applications and endpoints to stop breaches.\nBest-of-Breed Device and Network Security\nThe speed and sophistication of modern threats requires a multi-layer approach to security, integrating cutting-edge technologies to mitigate risk across an expanding attack surface.

The CrowdStrike and Fortinet partnership provides rich telemetry across endpoint and network, enabling fast and accurate AI-powered threat protection and response, while streamlining security operations with a single, unified view.\nThe Falcon platform revolutionized cybersecurity through an AI-native and adversary intelligence approach. Replacing antivirus and a host of other legacy point products has led to the market adopting the Falcon platform as the industry standard for endpoint security among other modules. Tested in multiple third-party assessments, the Falcon platform delivers industry-leading protection efficacy, enterprise scalability and deployment ease.\nFortinet\u2019s FortiGate NGFWs are available in multiple form factors, including hardware, software and as-a-Service. Fortinet\u2019s hardware utilizes proprietary purpose-built ASICs, yielding on average 17x faster firewall performance and are up to 90 percent more power efficient than the competition. The addition of Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard AI-powered Security Services offers organizations the highest threat-protection performance on the market today.\nThe seamless, bidirectional integration of CrowdStrike and Fortinet optimizes network and endpoint security, streamlines operations and accelerates detection and response to elusive threats across the entire enterprise environment. Customers and partners gain context-rich insights into network traffic, user activity and device posture, further strengthening their ability to mitigate security risks with consistent, real-time protection and responses against the latest and most sophisticated threats.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike and Fortinet are jointly committed to supporting a broad, adaptable and open cybersecurity ecosystem, providing customers and partners with the flexibility to build a tailored best-of-breed security strategy.\nTwo of the Industry\u2019s Most Validated Leaders Partner\n\"Two of cybersecurity's leading companies partnering, each with a world-class channel ecosystem, creates a powerful combination that benefits everyone involved,\" said Jay McBain, chief analyst at Canalys. \"The CrowdStrike and Fortinet partnership is a win for customers, who gain access to a multi-layer network and endpoint security, and a win for partners, who now have even greater opportunities to deliver value and drive growth.\"\nEarlier this year, CrowdStrike was named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP) for the fifth consecutive time.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\u201cWe Are Just at the Beginning of the AI Buildout\u201d\nEach of the big tech stocks has revealed its plans to invest $50 to $100 billion in GPU compute, evidence that Artificial intelligence may be the biggest theme right now. On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best FAANG Stock To Buy According to Analysts?\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nAnalyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 10.9%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters.\n2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies such as the industry\u2019s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. To keep its strategy active, on October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom\u2019s subsidiary, T-Systems. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider.\nOn June 13, Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, appeared in an Interview on Yahoo Finance where she shared her bullish stance on AVGO. Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man\u2019s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components.\nAs Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\"\nOverall AVGO ranks 4th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "We recently looked at Goldman Sachs\u2019 List Of Stocks That Hedge & Mutual Funds Love & Hate: 28 Stocks On The Mutual and Hedge Funds Radar. In this piece, we will look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) sits on the fund managers' radar.\nThe surge in interest surrounding artificial intelligence has meant that the stock market in 2024 has continued to surprise. Just like most Wall Street analysts were left scratching their heads after worries of a recession proved to be unfounded, this year, analysts have continued to revise their year end targets of the flagship S&P index multiple times. Take the example of investment bank Goldman Sachs. Its latest index year end target was released in October, and as of now, the bank believes that the index will close at 6,000 points by the end of this year.\nBefore the October target, the bank had upped its year end estimate to 5,600 points in June. This was based on optimism for big tech stocks and the rush surrounding AI that continued to fuel them. This had added 400 points to the previous target of 5,200 points which was released in February, and this in turn had added 100 points to the previous upward revision of 5,100 over the first Goldman Sachs S&P year end target of 4,700 points.\nSafe to say, the market has beaten expectations in 2024. Its recent value of 5,832 points leaves it just 2.8% shy of Goldman\u2019s latest 2024 estimate. The index is up by 23.6% year to date, and to see just how much its returns have been driven by artificial intelligence, consider the fact that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange\u2019s semiconductor stock index is up 27.8% year to date. AI, and particularly semiconductor stocks, continue to make their mark and the key question now is whether this performance will be sustained after the third quarter earnings season.\nThe Q2 season was nothing short of fireworks for some of the biggest AI names. Two firms in particular come to mind when we reminisce. The first is Wall Street\u2019s AI darling which is known for making the best AI GPUs in the world, and the second is the firm behind Windows OS that has invested billions of dollars in the AI upstart OpenAI.\u00a0 Both these stocks did well in the first half of 2024 but pared back some of their gains in H2. Starting from the GPU company, its stock is up 186% year to date. However, from the peak in June which had marked 181% in YTD gains back then, the shares are up by a modest 1.84%. For the software company, the shares peaked at 26% year to date returns before the Q2 earnings season, and since the peak, they are down 10.4%.\nStory Continues\nThe difference in their share price appreciation isn\u2019t surprising even though it might appear to be so. Simply put, the reason the GPU maker has posted stronger returns is its products are the immediate need of the AI industry. On the other hand, the software company\u2019s products are part of a later wave of AI which counts upon strong demand for AI products within the business world to enable it to turn a profit. Turning a profit is key since it has already invested billions of dollars into OpenAI.

Research from BofA covering their performance for the first quarter shows that 64% of actively managed large cap US mutual funds beat their benchmarks. This was a sizeable jump over 38% of funds beating the benchmarks last year, with the bank speculating that a broadening of equities performance was part of the reason driving the returns. A study from The Wall Street Journal adds to this. It looks at the performance of large cap growth funds during H1 2024 and shares that the Magnificent 7 stocks drove large cap growth funds to the top of the mutual fund pyramid. The survey looked at 1,218 funds to determine that just 15% were in the red, with the average 12 month return of all the surveyed funds being 16.5%.\nWhile on one end of the spectrum are the risk averse mutual funds, on the other, are hedge funds that chase alpha through leverage. This risk means that the funds can accumulate large losses that take years to recover from. This is the case for some of the funds, according to Goldman\u2019s latest industry report. It shows that Tiger Global, Whale Rock, and Third Point which fell 50%+, 45%, and 21.8% in 2022 still haven\u2019t recovered. In 2023, the three respective funds posted 28.5%, 18%, and 4.1%, while their performance through July was 10.7% and 10.9% for Tiger Global and Third Point and 18.9% through May for Whale Rock.\nIn fact, GS\u2019 data shows that roughly one third of long-short funds are yet to recover their 2022 losses, as they are joined by 31% of event driven funds and 45% of macro driven funds. However, some of the top performing funds in the first half were Bridgewater Associates and Citadel, which posted 14.1% and 13.7% in returns respectively. The top performer among hedge funds appears to be AQR Capital with its long/short fund delivering 16.3% in returns.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that hedge funds and mutual funds love and hate, we divided Goldman\u2019s Hedge Fund Trend Monitor and Mutual Fundamentals report into four categories. These categories are stocks that both avoid, stocks that both love, and stocks favored by one but avoided by the other. Stocks within these categories were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. To learn more about the number of top hedge fund investments in some of these stocks, you can check out Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 130\nCategory: Most popular with HFs and underweight among mutual funds\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a diversified hardware and software company. On the hardware front, it is primarily a semiconductor designer that sells chips such as modems, network controllers, and ASICs. Its network processors and ASICs expose Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to revenue from the AI industry on multiple fronts. The processors are used in data center connectivity and the firm benefits from the growth in data centers stemming from higher AI use. Additionally, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s ASIC division means that it is able to design and sell chips tailor made for custom use cases. These are important in the AI era as well, especially since the industry\u2019s mainstay GPUs from NVIDIA are in short supply and costly. Subsequently, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) can benefit from a growth in industry interest towards developing custom AI chips. On the software front, the firm benefits from high margin revenue through its cybersecurity division. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s fiscal Q3 saw software revenue jump by 300% due to its VMWare acquisition.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 15th on our list of stocks that fund managers love and hate according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery.

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -3.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.4% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.13 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for AVGO _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 14.3% below.\nAfter much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank\u2019s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\nWhile some processors and graphics chips stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nBroadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. The company expects about $12 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2024, which means 20% of its total revenue will come from AI and counting.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Many are closely watching trends and data that could impact future growth and stability.\nTom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently shared his insights on the current market trends during an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 14. He acknowledged that he underestimated the strength of the market, noting that it has been surprisingly resilient despite expectations of volatility leading up to the 2024 election. Lee highlighted that there is a significant amount of cash\u2014about $6 trillion\u2014sitting on the sidelines, which has contributed to the market\u2019s stability. He observed that many investors had anticipated a recession, but instead, companies have shown strong earnings and resilience.\nLee also mentioned that the Federal Reserve is likely to adopt a supportive stance as inflation data continues to trend toward their 2% target. He believes that regardless of who wins the upcoming election, stocks are likely to perform well in the following year. Lee pointed out that markets tend to thrive on visibility and certainty, suggesting that if one candidate appears to be gaining an advantage, it could lead to a more favorable trading environment before the election. Overall, he remains optimistic about the market\u2019s outlook.\nS&P 500 and Dow Reach New Heights Ahead of Election Season\nOn October 18, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached new record highs, marking six consecutive weeks of gains for these major indices. As reported by CNBC, the S&P 500 rose by 0.40%, closing at 5,864.67, while the Dow rose by 0.09% and added 36.86 points to close at 43,275.91. The Nasdaq also performed well, increasing 0.63% to close at 18,489.55. This marks the longest winning streak of the year for both the Dow and S&P 500, with notable increases in their overall performance.\nAs earnings season progresses, over 70 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their results, with about 75% of those companies surpassing expectations. Despite potential market volatility leading up to the upcoming election, some analysts believe that stocks may continue to rise through November.\nRob Williams, a chief investment strategist at Sage Advisory, noted that this trend is unusual for an election year, where markets typically hesitate before improving post-election. He suggested that investors might be optimistic about a possible victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose policies are seen as more favorable for businesses in terms of regulations and taxes.\nStory Continues\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 30 stocks.\nNext, we focused on identifying stocks that had demonstrated consistent growth. From the initial list, we narrowed our choices to stocks that have grown their revenue positively over the past 5 years. We further refined our selection to include only those that had positive revenue growth each year in their last five reported annual revenues.\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the revenue CAGR over the past five years, and Macrotrends, which offered information on historical annual revenue data. Finally, we have ranked the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy below in ascending order based on their five-year revenue CAGR.\nAdditionally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds as of Q2 of 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nThe Zacks analyst expect NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 46.4% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nShares of Microsoft have gained +11.9% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Software industry\u2019s gain of +13.3%. The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\n\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth. The Zacks analyst expect fiscal 2025 net sales to grow 12.8% from fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\n\nBroadcom\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the year-to-date period (+63.0% vs. +44.3%). The company is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. Its expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy.\n\nAVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\n\nShares of Comstock have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry over the year-to-date period (+143.9% vs. +26.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $106.61 million recorded strong revenue growth of 11% year over year, reaching $21.4 million in the first half of 2024.\n\nThis growth is driven by high demand for its premium, transit-oriented properties like The Hartford and Reston Metro Plaza, with fully leased spaces attracting high-profile tenants such as Google, Rolls-Royce, and GuidePoint Security. The company\u2019s focus on urban, commuter-friendly developments positions it well to capture long-term growth in the Washington D.C. market.\n\nComstock's asset-light, debt-free model, combined with access to a $10 million credit facility, provides ample financial flexibility for future developments. Its diversified tenant base and strong occupancy rates reduce vacancy risk. However, the company faces concentration risk with heavy reliance on key developments. A structural shift toward remote work also poses challenges to its office leasing performance.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Comstock here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Roche Holding AG (RHHBY), American Express Co. (AXP) and The Progressive Corp. (PGR).\n\nMark Vickery\nSenior Editor\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

          "whole_article": "In the latest market close, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) reached $179.99, with a +0.06% movement compared to the previous day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.18% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.8%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.27%.\nShares of the chipmaker witnessed a gain of 5.14% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 6.6% and outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 4.46%.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Broadcom Inc. in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.39, reflecting a 25.23% increase from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $14.06 billion, indicating a 51.29% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nAVGO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.82 per share and revenue of $51.58 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.95% and +44.01%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Broadcom Inc. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.12% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Currently, Broadcom Inc. is carrying a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nInvestors should also note Broadcom Inc.'s current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 37.29. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 34.31, which means Broadcom Inc. is trading at a premium to the group.\nAlso, we should mention that AVGO has a PEG ratio of 2.27. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Electronics - Semiconductors industry was having an average PEG ratio of 3.81.\nStory Continues\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 100, placing it within the top 40% of over 250 industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nEnsure to harness Zacks.com to stay updated with all these stock-shifting metrics, among others, in the next trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Darren. Good afternoon, everyone, I really appreciate you joining today. Because a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report, I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow is growth trajectory. First is elite level execution, with our Q3 results we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution.\nWe outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand. The defense logistics agency works with ServiceNow assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project. Bangkok de Brazil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation.\nThe Veterans Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the Veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI powered solutions to improve its colleague experience.\nAfter rolling out now assist globally, EY works with ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks to deliver faster resolutions for enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life saving mission.\nMercedes Benz work to its ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

Overall, this was a strong quarter.\nIs now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million.\nAlso, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 39.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $959.64 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,034.\nStory Continues\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

The company observed that showing sustainable development, the current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) increase of 23.5% exceeded its 22% expectation. The bank also said that strong customer resonance from ServiceNow's efforts in important areas is paying off.\nWarning!

Analyzers pointed out, nonetheless, a slowing down in cRPO growth relative to Q2 and suggested a possible slowing down in Q4. Still, they underlined ServiceNow's strong foundation for monetizing generative artificial intelligence solutions by 2025.\nFollowing in line, Stifel and RBC raised their price estimates to $990 and $1,045, respectively. Praising the company's platform strength, rising acceptance of ProPlus and Now Assist, and its recently launched Workflow Data Fabric, RBC called Q3 a \"Home Run Of A Quarter.\" Q3 results of ServiceNow and future direction highlight its strong position in important growth sectors, including government contracts and generative artificial intelligence, which analysts feel will propel momentum into 2025.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Yet, the raised full-year subscription revenue guidance to $10.66 billion and a substantial 36% increase in total remaining performance obligations indicate confidence in sustaining the growth trajectory. With multiple price target upgrades from BofA, RBC, and other top firms, investor sentiment remains strong, underpinned by ServiceNow's continued momentum in AI and digital transformation initiatives.\nLooking forward, the company is doubling down on global expansion, committing $1.5 billion to boost its UK operations and unveiling new data centers in Italy to meet rising demand. The appointment of Amit Zavery as CPO and COO, coupled with aggressive AI investments, signals ServiceNow's readiness to capitalize on the generative AI boom into 2025 and beyond.

Current remaining performance obligation, a measure of booked sales, increased 26% in the period ending Sept. 30. Both exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company makes applications that help companies organize and automate their personnel and information technology operations. Like its peers, ServiceNow is baking generative AI features into its products and offers a pricier tier with those tools.\nThe company\u2019s main generative AI assistant product, Now Assist, is the fastest-growing in company history, Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott said in an interview. The average contract premium for users of Now Assist is 30%, he added.\nThe shares hit a record high Thursday in New York, jumping about 6%. Investors were initially unimpressed with the results, with the stock trading down Wednesday evening. The shares had increased 28% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close. That\u2019s more than twice the rally seen in the iShares Expanded Software ETF, which is often used as a sector benchmark.\nThe results \u201cvalidate the company\u2019s rare standing in enterprise software,\u201d wrote Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup. He cited strong execution in a tough environment for tech spending and early monetization of generative AI.\nIn recent weeks, ServiceNow and software peers like Salesforce Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have begun emphasizing AI \u201cagents\u201d that can complete tasks without user supervision. Some customers are already trying ServiceNow\u2019s agents, which will be released more broadly next month, McDermott said. Once the agents are fully rolled out, they\u2019ll be priced differently from other products, McDermott added.\nFor the current quarter ending in December, ServiceNow projected subscription revenue of about $2.88 billion, just ahead of analyst estimates. The company expects near-term bookings to rise 21.5%.\nThis bookings guidance was effectively \u201cgood, but not great,\u201d Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note. He added that the company tends to issue conservative forecasts for the fourth quarter.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also announced the hiring of a leader from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Cloud for a prominent role. Amit Zavery will fill titles vacated earlier this year by CJ Desai as president, chief product officer and chief operating officer. Zavery will focus on product and engineering, McDermott said. His first-year compensation is targeted at about $2 million, with a $3 million signing bonus, according to a filing.\nDesai left the company in July after a complaint about a government contract and the hiring of a former US Army technology leader. He has since been tapped for a high-level executive role at Cloudflare Inc.\nLast month, Bloomberg reported that Carahsoft Technology Corp., a government-focused technology reseller, was under investigation alongside SAP SE for potentially conspiring to overcharge federal agencies.\nCarahsoft is also a major partner of ServiceNow\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re currently not involved in any issues related to Carahsoft and the US federal business,\u201d McDermott said when asked about the issue during a call with analysts Wednesday.\nProfit, excluding some items, was $3.72 per share, ahead of analyst estimates. The company saw a spike in large deals worth more than $5 million in annual contract value, it said.\nServiceNow hired more than 1,200 workers in the quarter. The company now has 25,743 employees. Much of the hiring is of quota-bearing sales representatives, which shows \u201cour confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Gina Mastantuono during the call.\n(Updates share reaction in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity.

Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news.

(NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0April 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cUS-based software company,ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW), provided another strong result, continuing its long and consistent track record of 20%-plus revenue growth combined with healthy profitability. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year to $2.5 billion and free cash flow grew 47% year-on-year to $1.2 billion. The company\u2019s core operating metrics were also impressive with remaining performance obligations growing 26% year-on-year to $17.7 billion (i.e. roughly 2x 2023 revenue) and renewal rates holding steady at 98%. Performance was evenly spread across segments, products, and geographies, with notable strength in the US federal government. The company now boasts 1,933 customers generating in excess of $1 million in Annual Contract Value (ACV), which is pleasing to see as it implies multiple solutions are involved and that the company\u2019s platform model is increasingly resonating with customers. In our view, ServiceNow is one the highest quality software businesses globally as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it a compelling opportunity.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Palantir Technologies (PLTR) helps clients develop their own agents for internal use, including legal work.\nAnd in a recent podcast interview, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang envisioned a future where 100 million AI agents would be deployed within the company.\n\u201cOur inbox is going to be full of directories of AIs that we work with,\u201d he said. \u201cAIs will recruit other AIs to solve problems. AIs will be in Slack channels with each other and with humans.\u201d\nStory Continues\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks onstage with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff during Salesforce's Dreamforce on Sept. 17, 2024, in San Francisco, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \u00b7 Justin Sullivan via Getty Images\nHowever, the battle over autonomous agents has pit Salesforce and Microsoft against each other in particular, in part because the companies have clashed publicly but also because of the trove of enterprise data both have access to. CEO Marc Benioff has repeatedly likened Microsoft\u2019s Copilot to Clippy, its doomed Office assistant from the 1990s, once listed as one of Time\u2019s 50 worst inventions.\nAt its Dreamforce event last month, Shih doubled down on the criticism, without naming Microsoft directly, while touting the Agentforce platform.\n\u201cThis is the difference between a DIY science project versus a real enterprise-grade agent you can confidently deploy into production,\u201d Shih said. She added that Salesforce agents showed 33% greater accuracy and \u201ctwo times greater relevance\u201d than competitors, according to customer benchmarks.\nEarlier this week, Microsoft said agent deployment in companies like McKinsey & Company and UK-based Pets at Home have already been shown to cut down on time spent processing time-consuming work, including data entry.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nWith the wider release of Agentforce set for Oct. 29, Shih emphasized that these agents are not meant to replace human workers but assist them so that \u201chumans can start at higher level.\u201d\nShih expects Salesforce\u2019s advantage to grow as the battle for digital assistants heats up because of its ability to connect individual clients\u2019 data through Data Cloud and the safety layers in place for Agentforce.\nShe said human interaction with digital assistants will \u201cgrow exponentially.\u201d\n\u201cI think it's similar to asking the question maybe in 1998 of, in the future, how many other interactions will be through the internet or some sort of digital medium,\u201d Shih said. \u201cI very much believe that agents will play that role in the future. Agents will become the apps that all of us interface with.\u201d\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"
