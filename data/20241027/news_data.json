          "whole_article": "US companies already dominate the global stock market when it comes to size. A new chart from JPMorgan Asset Management shows that's largely expected to continue. The firm attributes the boom to artificial intelligence.\nIn JPM's 2025 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions released on Monday, the team projected that US companies' market cap share of the total global equity market will fall from 64% currently to 60% in 2037. Still, as seen in the chart below, the US (in green) would maintain a large lead over the estimated second-largest share of the global equity market, China (in red).\nJPMorgan Asset Management's global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions Monica Issar told Yahoo Finance during a media roundtable on Monday that the US will continue to lead by market cap share as artificial intelligence benefits expand beyond a few large tech names that have dominated the market rally over the past year to companies in various industries.\nIssar gave two reasons for the prediction: revenue production and margin improvement. The first will come from the money pouring into AI benefiting companies outside of Big Tech. This plays out as tech companies buy AI chips from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), and, as they need more power, these AI operators are forced to spend with companies in the Utilities (XLU) and Energy (XLE) sectors.\nAs AI makes companies more efficient and eliminates the most simple work, eventually cutting down costs, US corporates should get a boost to profit margins.\n\"It's going to be the US predominantly, and then obviously Europe will follow, because you're starting to see some adoption there,\" Issar said.\nTo put the current US dominance in perspective, just Nvidia's (NVDA) market cap alone is larger than most other G7 countries, Apollo chief global economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k wrote in a research note on Thursday. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nTo be sure, Sl\u00f8k noted that this could be a risk to the market overall.\n\"Global equity markets, including retirement allocations to equities, are basically leveraged to Nvidia,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote. \"Let\u2019s hope the value of Nvidia doesn\u2019t decline significantly.\"\nOthers have a more sanguine view of the AI superpower's dominance, though. In a recent research note detailing why the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could average more than 10% annual returns over the next decade, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed to the US being at the forefront of AI adoption and well positioned to dominate amid the technology's \"global adoption.\"\nStory Continues\nColas wrote the odds that a non-US tech company will rise over the next decade and unseat the large tech companies currently driving the US market share like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are \"almost zero.\"\n\"The US continues to dominate global venture capital,\" Colas wrote. \"If a new US business does eventually threaten their preeminence, then it will certainly go public, be in the S&P 500, and drive future returns.\"\nThe national flag is installed for a campaign rally of former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outside of Christ Chapel in Zebulon, Georgia, on Oct. 23, 2024.

Both the S&P 500 and Dow snapped a six-week winning streak.\nEquities were unsettled by a rapid spike in yields as bets on rate cuts by the Federal Reserve unraveled on expectations of a stronger economic outlook.\nSource: Investing.com\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events as investors continue to assess the outlook for the economy, inflation, and rate cuts.\nMost important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s U.S. employment report for October, which is forecast to show the economy added 111,000 positions.

Profit estimates have been revised upward 23 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\nMeta is seen earning $5.27 per share, jumping 20.1% from EPS of $4.39 in the year-ago period. Revenue is forecast to increase 18% year-over-year to $40.3 billion as the social media giant benefits from favorable digital advertising trends and its strategic investments in artificial intelligence.\nThe company\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the fourth quarter will also beat consensus estimates as the social media company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base and fresh AI initiatives.\nMeta Platforms Stock Chart\nSource: Investing.com\nMETA stock - which rallied to a record high of $602.95 on October 7 - ended at $573.25 on Friday.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nIn a recent Tech Check program, CNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI\u2019s head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries. In the latest round of AI developments, an OpenAI spokesperson revealed that the company is reportedly planning to release its next frontier AI model, codenamed Orion, by December. This release is going to be in the form of a phased rollout, where it will gradually release the model to trusted partners before a broader rollout through ChatGPT. The upcoming frontier model release is quite crucial, considering that the company has recently raised $6.6 billion in funding at a $157 billion valuation. Moreover, investors anticipate more advanced models to maintain its leadership in the tech industry.\nRival Anthropic comes bearing their own set of breaking news. As reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide \u201cmathematically precise and reproducible answers\u201d by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThink of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data \u2014 cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result\u201d.\nDespite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly \u201challucinating\u201d. OpenAI may deem it to have near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy\u201d, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments. A University of Michigan researcher found hallucinations in 80% of the audio transcriptions he examined during a study of public meetings.\nSuch mistakes could have \u201creally grave consequences,\u201d particularly in hospital settings\u2026Nobody wants a misdiagnosis\u201d and that \u201cThere should be a higher bar.\u201d\nWith that, let's look at the 15 recent AI news that nobody should miss.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks \u2014 Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet.\nThe debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines.\nThat\u2019s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals.\nFreedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on \u201chopes and dreams\u201d than fundamentals.\n\u201cTesla had its moment in the sun \u2026 to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,\u201d Woods warned on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief.\nWhile CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm\u2019s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off.

For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022.\nBank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix\u2019s growing free cash flow as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nAs of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock.\nWhile Tesla\u2019s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix\u2019s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.\nSeana's week ahead checklist\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Whether they can reverse that trend will go a long way to determining if the rally in equities can keep going.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nThe five biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index by market capitalization \u2014 Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. \u2014 are projected to post average earnings growth of 19% in their third-quarter results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. While that would handily top the S&P 500\u2019s projected 4.3% increase, it also would represent their slowest collective expansion in six quarters, BI data shows.\nWhat\u2019s more, the gap between Big Tech and the rest of the market is expected to continue to narrow into 2025, by which time last year\u2019s roughly 35% quarterly earnings growth will be a distant memory. So the question for investors is what this means for these stocks, all of which have soared through the market\u2019s latest rally, and whether they can continue leading indexes higher.\n\u201cSentiment is a lot shakier than in past quarters, and the factors driving the market now feel more negative,\u201d said Andrew Choi, portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments in San Francisco. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the rally is over, but there are opportunities elsewhere, especially as we have these debates about Big Tech valuations, slower earnings momentum, and every story now has some element of controversy or debate that\u2019s weighing on sentiment.\u201d\nMarket Rotates\nFor most of the past two years, the tech giants have led the S&P 500 higher, fueled by relentlessly expanding profits and investors willing to keep paying higher multiples for those earnings. That\u2019s changed in recent months, however.\nSince peaking on July 10 following a 22% rally to start the year, the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, which is comprised of the five S&P behemoths as well as Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc., has fallen 2%. That lags every major sector in the S&P 500, with the utilities, real estate, financial and industrial groups jumping more than 10% and the broader index gaining 3.1% over the same span.\nAll of which has put Big Tech companies in a position they\u2019re unaccustomed to: stock market underdogs. They\u2019re facing greater scrutiny with valuations elevated and questions about when their heavy spending on artificial intelligence initiatives will pay off.\nStory Continues\n\u201cTech ceding its market leadership position could last through the end of the year, but that doesn\u2019t scare us off from owning them long term,\u201d said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a risk that earnings growth is decelerating, and valuations may be a little stretched. But they still bring so much growth to the table And there\u2019s still significant upside to earnings potential over the coming years.\u201d\nWhile Tesla has already posted better than expected third-quarter profits and an encouraging outlook, Big Tech earnings season really kicks off in earnest this week. Google-owner Alphabet reports on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, and Apple and Amazon on Thursday. Nvidia isn\u2019t expected to give results until late November.\nAn AI Future\nAll of this week\u2019s reporters come with their own issues. Microsoft faces concerns about its prospects in AI. Apple has seen early signs of tepid demand for its newest iPhones, although long-term optimism helped send the stock to a record last week. Amazon investors are worried about heavy capital spending eating into profits. And Alphabet has regulatory uncertainty as the US Justice Department investigates it for monopoly practices.\nAI will be a big focus for investors watching the earnings reports, particularly how much the companies are spending on expensive infrastructure. In the third quarter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms are projected to have poured $56 billion into capital expenditures, up 52% from the same period a year ago.\nInvestors generally buy the premise that the companies\u2019 AI investments represent the future of technology. But there\u2019s also little evidence of an immediate burst of profitability for companies like Microsoft, which has integrated AI features into its software products. Disappointment over the disparity between AI spending and outcomes marred an otherwise strong second-quarter earnings season. Now, it\u2019s raising concerns about future profit margins.\n\u201cTop-line gains are starting to get offset by surging AI-related capital spending,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper wrote in a research note. \u201cThat implies peak margins are likely in the past, at least for the near term.\u201d\nBig Tech\u2019s recent underperformance has coincided with souring sentiment from the so-called smart money on Wall Street. Hedge funds have been selling Magnificent Seven stocks over the past several months, and despite modest buying in October net long positions as a percentage of total US exposure are still around the lowest level since mid-2023, according to data from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage desk.\nValuation Conundrum\nDespite the slump in megacap stock prices, many of these companies are carrying valuations that are higher than historical averages. Apple is trading at 32 times estimated profits over the next 12 months, compared with an average of 20 times over the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft is priced at 33 times, compared with an average of 25.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at tech, are earnings really going to grow enough to keep pace with these multiples, or does some of the recent strength reflect a fear of missing out?\u201d said Clark Bellin, chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss the impact of momentum, but at some point the music could stop, and people need to keep their expectations in check this earnings season.\u201d\nTo be sure, Wall Street pros remain overwhelmingly bullish on Big Tech. Roughly 90% of the analysts covering Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia have buy ratings on the stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figures are 83% for Alphabet and 65% for Apple, while the average S&P 500 company sits at about 53%.\nThe reason for the optimism is fairly simple. For all the concerns, they continue to offer above average profit growth, exposure to AI, strong capital returns and less risk than other stock market sectors, according to Parnassus\u2019s Choi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find dominant businesses with this kind of earnings growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to like.\u201d\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about.\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech.\nCramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted.\n\u201c... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.\u201d\nCramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day\u2019s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn\u2019t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts.\n\u201cSee, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.\u201d\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\nHe addressed the \u201calleged earnings disappointment,\u201d clarifying that he chose the term \u201calleged\u201d because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts.\nStory Continues\nHe reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment.\nConcluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked:\n\u201cBut the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nDiscussing Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Cramer remarked on its products and advertising business. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\u201cRates don't matter all that much to Microsoft or Meta or Google. Neither they nor their clients need to borrow large sums of money so the bond markets are irrelevant to them\u2026 You go to Meta, which also has an amazing balance sheet and extraordinary demand for its products. Their AI Ray-Bans are a huge hit, but that's barely a drop in the ocean because they can make so much money from the targeted advertising business and they will.\u201d\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a prominent technology company dedicated to creating products that enable users to connect and share across various devices. The company's financial performance has been strong, largely fueled by the ongoing transition to digital advertising. As the global digital advertising market is projected to grow from $366 billion in 2022 to over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to take advantage of this significant expansion.\nUser growth has played a crucial role in its success. In the second quarter, the number of individuals engaging with Meta\u2019s suite of social media platforms increased by 7%, reaching 3.27 billion and the ad revenue reached a whopping $38.3 billion.\nAdditionally, Meta (NASDAQ:META) is advancing its AI initiatives, currently with the development of Llama 4. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has indicated that this upcoming model could set a new standard for the industry when it launches next year. The company is also working to deploy 600,000 GPUs by the end of 2024, which shows a commitment to its long-term AI goals. The company has a strong balance sheet as it reported cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $58.08 billion, alongside a free cash flow of $10.90 billion, as of June 30.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Mark Zuckerberg and Meta are carving out a somewhat unique path in the artificial intelligence arms race by going all in open-source AI.

          "whole_article": "Next week, three of the biggest names in tech are set to report earnings, and investors will be watching closely. Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL) remain stalwarts of this market, and their quarterly earning reports not only affect their stock prices but also the broader market.\nDuring this year we have seen an interesting divergence in performance among these stocks, although even the worst performer, Alphabet, has still put up a decent return. Meta Platforms has been the clear outperformer year-to-date (YTD) more than tripling the returns of the others and Apple has slightly underperformed the market.\nThe near-term outlooks for these companies are also varied, although frankly, their business supremacy is still evident, and the long-term outlooks are still very bright in my opinion. Let\u2019s dive deeper into the details below.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta Platforms: Strong Outlook for the Stock\nMeta Platforms has been one of the best performing stocks in the market since the 2022 bear market. In terms of large cap stocks, only Nvidia has been better. Over the last two years META stock has rallied an incredible 346%. But that strong performance shouldn\u2019t shake investors\u2019 confidence, because it seems likely that the stock will continue to perform well.\nMETA enjoys numerous bullish catalysts that should make the stock a must watch. Currently, it enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.83%. Earnings are forecast to grow at an impressive 19.15% annually over the next three to five years, while the company also has a reasonable valuation of 26.5x forward earnings, just above the market average.\nLooking at META\u2019s stock chart, I also see a compelling technical setup. We can see just a few weeks ago the stock broke out from a clear bull flag, which sent it to new record highs. Today, there is a very similar pattern building. If the stock can break out above the $580 level, it should send it again to new highs. However, the market may wait until the earnings report to make the move.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nAlphabet: Cheapest Stock Among the Group\nAlthough Alphabet stock has struggled this year when compared to Apple, Meta and the broad market, it remains one of the premier assets in the market. Its entrenched business model and growth catalysts, combined with a relatively cheap valuation, make it a must watch stock as well. GOOGL also enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.\nStory Continues\nThe growth catalysts are, I think, very exciting and surprisingly overlooked by most market participants. Self-driving cars is one of the hottest topics out there today, and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo seems to be quietly winning the race. The self-driving technology has already been deployed in several cities across the country, completing some 100,000 rides per week by partnering with Uber Technologies (UBER). It also seems that Waymo\u2019s technology, which uses a suite of sensors, rather than camera\u2019s, is a superior approach. This approach will also give it a business advantage as it may be able to be implemented through software, rather than having to develop entire vehicles.\nWhat is crazy to me is that even with these factors, GOOGL trades at a forward earnings multiple of 21.3x, below the market average and its 10-year median of 25.8x. It also forecasts earnings to grow 17.2% annually over the next three to five years. Finally, its Zacks Earnings ESP is 0.4%, meaning it is expected to beat earnings estimates slightly at the next report.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple: Steady Growth, But AI Could Push the Stock Higher\nApple, of course one of the great stocks and companies of the world, has a slightly worse near-term outlook than the other two. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating and a worrying Zacks Earnings ESP of -17.7%. It also has the richest valuation at 30.6x forward earnings, and the lowest earnings growth projections, at 12.7% annual growth over the next three to five years.\nHowever, you should never count this stock out. Because Apple\u2019s products are so widely used, its foray into AI may become the most effective and widely used option out there. Apple Intelligence will enhance user experiences in areas like Siri, camera capabilities, health monitoring, and app functionalities, making its devices even smarter and more intuitive. I believe every incremental improvement in its products further increases our reliance on the product, deepens its moat and improves selling points.\nEspecially notable is the technical setup in AAPL stock. Although we have seen the price action trade in a sideways and volatile manner over the last four months, it has formed a very large and compelling bull flag. I would not be surprised if Apple surprised investors at its upcoming earnings and blasted higher through the breakout level. However, investors should be cautious here, as we noted the risks which could easily send the stock through the support level as well.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy AAPL, GOOGL and META Shares?\nWhile each of these tech giants faces unique challenges, their long-term growth prospects remain strong. Meta\u2019s robust earnings growth and favorable technical setup make it an intriguing opportunity, especially if it breaks out above key levels. Alphabet stands out for its relatively low valuation and the potential of Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology to drive future growth. Apple, despite near-term concerns, could see upside if its AI initiatives boost user engagement and enhance product capabilities.\nIt is always hard to say if investors should buy a stock before earnings, because the results are difficult to predict, and the stocks can be extremely volatile. Nonetheless, each of these stocks offers compelling long-term opportunity and can fit into nearly any investors portfolio.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "US companies already dominate the global stock market when it comes to size. A new chart from JPMorgan Asset Management shows that's largely expected to continue. The firm attributes the boom to artificial intelligence.\nIn JPM's 2025 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions released on Monday, the team projected that US companies' market cap share of the total global equity market will fall from 64% currently to 60% in 2037. Still, as seen in the chart below, the US (in green) would maintain a large lead over the estimated second-largest share of the global equity market, China (in red).\nJPMorgan Asset Management's global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions Monica Issar told Yahoo Finance during a media roundtable on Monday that the US will continue to lead by market cap share as artificial intelligence benefits expand beyond a few large tech names that have dominated the market rally over the past year to companies in various industries.\nIssar gave two reasons for the prediction: revenue production and margin improvement. The first will come from the money pouring into AI benefiting companies outside of Big Tech. This plays out as tech companies buy AI chips from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), and, as they need more power, these AI operators are forced to spend with companies in the Utilities (XLU) and Energy (XLE) sectors.\nAs AI makes companies more efficient and eliminates the most simple work, eventually cutting down costs, US corporates should get a boost to profit margins.\n\"It's going to be the US predominantly, and then obviously Europe will follow, because you're starting to see some adoption there,\" Issar said.\nTo put the current US dominance in perspective, just Nvidia's (NVDA) market cap alone is larger than most other G7 countries, Apollo chief global economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k wrote in a research note on Thursday. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nTo be sure, Sl\u00f8k noted that this could be a risk to the market overall.\n\"Global equity markets, including retirement allocations to equities, are basically leveraged to Nvidia,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote. \"Let\u2019s hope the value of Nvidia doesn\u2019t decline significantly.\"\nOthers have a more sanguine view of the AI superpower's dominance, though. In a recent research note detailing why the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could average more than 10% annual returns over the next decade, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed to the US being at the forefront of AI adoption and well positioned to dominate amid the technology's \"global adoption.\"\nStory Continues\nColas wrote the odds that a non-US tech company will rise over the next decade and unseat the large tech companies currently driving the US market share like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are \"almost zero.\"\n\"The US continues to dominate global venture capital,\" Colas wrote. \"If a new US business does eventually threaten their preeminence, then it will certainly go public, be in the S&P 500, and drive future returns.\"\nThe national flag is installed for a campaign rally of former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outside of Christ Chapel in Zebulon, Georgia, on Oct. 23, 2024.

          "whole_article": "Tesla (TSLA) has work to do if it wants to remain among tech elites.\nDespite a surprising third quarter earnings report that sent the EV maker's stock surging \u2014 resulting in its biggest intraday jump in over a decade \u2014 Wall Street is once again reevaluating its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven.\nThe group\u2019s members \u2014 Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla \u2014 dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks \u2014 Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet.\nThe debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines.\nThat\u2019s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals.\nFreedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on \u201chopes and dreams\u201d than fundamentals.\n\u201cTesla had its moment in the sun \u2026 to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,\u201d Woods warned on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief.\nWhile CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm\u2019s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business \u2014 a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers.\n\u201cI've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen \u2026 We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,\u201d longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me.\nTesla\u2019s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group.\n\u2022 USD\n(TSLA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAs of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts.\nAs far as Tesla\u2019s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender.\nWealth Enhancement Group\u2019s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix \u201cmakes the most sense,\u201d as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance.\nStory Continues\nSince the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nPortfolio Wealth Advisors\u2019 Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a \u201ccash flow machine,\" and Netflix \u201cfits the bill.\u201d\n\u201cNetflix\u2019s free cash flow has been relentless \u2026 Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,\u201d Alvarado added.\nThe streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022.\nBank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix\u2019s growing free cash flow as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nAs of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock.\nWhile Tesla\u2019s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix\u2019s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.\nSeana's week ahead checklist\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Slowing profit growth is removing some of the invincibility surrounding the stock market\u2019s technology giants as they prepare to report earnings this week. Whether they can reverse that trend will go a long way to determining if the rally in equities can keep going.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nThe five biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index by market capitalization \u2014 Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. \u2014 are projected to post average earnings growth of 19% in their third-quarter results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. While that would handily top the S&P 500\u2019s projected 4.3% increase, it also would represent their slowest collective expansion in six quarters, BI data shows.\nWhat\u2019s more, the gap between Big Tech and the rest of the market is expected to continue to narrow into 2025, by which time last year\u2019s roughly 35% quarterly earnings growth will be a distant memory. So the question for investors is what this means for these stocks, all of which have soared through the market\u2019s latest rally, and whether they can continue leading indexes higher.\n\u201cSentiment is a lot shakier than in past quarters, and the factors driving the market now feel more negative,\u201d said Andrew Choi, portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments in San Francisco. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the rally is over, but there are opportunities elsewhere, especially as we have these debates about Big Tech valuations, slower earnings momentum, and every story now has some element of controversy or debate that\u2019s weighing on sentiment.\u201d\nMarket Rotates\nFor most of the past two years, the tech giants have led the S&P 500 higher, fueled by relentlessly expanding profits and investors willing to keep paying higher multiples for those earnings. That\u2019s changed in recent months, however.\nSince peaking on July 10 following a 22% rally to start the year, the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, which is comprised of the five S&P behemoths as well as Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc., has fallen 2%. That lags every major sector in the S&P 500, with the utilities, real estate, financial and industrial groups jumping more than 10% and the broader index gaining 3.1% over the same span.\nAll of which has put Big Tech companies in a position they\u2019re unaccustomed to: stock market underdogs. They\u2019re facing greater scrutiny with valuations elevated and questions about when their heavy spending on artificial intelligence initiatives will pay off.\nStory Continues\n\u201cTech ceding its market leadership position could last through the end of the year, but that doesn\u2019t scare us off from owning them long term,\u201d said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a risk that earnings growth is decelerating, and valuations may be a little stretched. But they still bring so much growth to the table And there\u2019s still significant upside to earnings potential over the coming years.\u201d\nWhile Tesla has already posted better than expected third-quarter profits and an encouraging outlook, Big Tech earnings season really kicks off in earnest this week. Google-owner Alphabet reports on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, and Apple and Amazon on Thursday. Nvidia isn\u2019t expected to give results until late November.\nAn AI Future\nAll of this week\u2019s reporters come with their own issues. Microsoft faces concerns about its prospects in AI. Apple has seen early signs of tepid demand for its newest iPhones, although long-term optimism helped send the stock to a record last week. Amazon investors are worried about heavy capital spending eating into profits. And Alphabet has regulatory uncertainty as the US Justice Department investigates it for monopoly practices.\nAI will be a big focus for investors watching the earnings reports, particularly how much the companies are spending on expensive infrastructure. In the third quarter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms are projected to have poured $56 billion into capital expenditures, up 52% from the same period a year ago.\nInvestors generally buy the premise that the companies\u2019 AI investments represent the future of technology. But there\u2019s also little evidence of an immediate burst of profitability for companies like Microsoft, which has integrated AI features into its software products. Disappointment over the disparity between AI spending and outcomes marred an otherwise strong second-quarter earnings season. Now, it\u2019s raising concerns about future profit margins.\n\u201cTop-line gains are starting to get offset by surging AI-related capital spending,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper wrote in a research note. \u201cThat implies peak margins are likely in the past, at least for the near term.\u201d\nBig Tech\u2019s recent underperformance has coincided with souring sentiment from the so-called smart money on Wall Street. Hedge funds have been selling Magnificent Seven stocks over the past several months, and despite modest buying in October net long positions as a percentage of total US exposure are still around the lowest level since mid-2023, according to data from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage desk.\nValuation Conundrum\nDespite the slump in megacap stock prices, many of these companies are carrying valuations that are higher than historical averages. Apple is trading at 32 times estimated profits over the next 12 months, compared with an average of 20 times over the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft is priced at 33 times, compared with an average of 25.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at tech, are earnings really going to grow enough to keep pace with these multiples, or does some of the recent strength reflect a fear of missing out?\u201d said Clark Bellin, chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss the impact of momentum, but at some point the music could stop, and people need to keep their expectations in check this earnings season.\u201d\nTo be sure, Wall Street pros remain overwhelmingly bullish on Big Tech. Roughly 90% of the analysts covering Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia have buy ratings on the stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figures are 83% for Alphabet and 65% for Apple, while the average S&P 500 company sits at about 53%.\nThe reason for the optimism is fairly simple. For all the concerns, they continue to offer above average profit growth, exposure to AI, strong capital returns and less risk than other stock market sectors, according to Parnassus\u2019s Choi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find dominant businesses with this kind of earnings growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to like.\u201d\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Apple's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 40% ownership\nInsiders have sold recently\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 60% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Apple.\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Apple. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Apple's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Apple. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.5% of the company stock.\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\nStory Continues\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$2.2b of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nWith a 37% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Apple. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nNext Steps:\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Apple that you should be aware of before investing here.\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nTesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company\u2019s quarterly results with a flurry of buying.\nA 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d counterparts \u2014 and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began.\nThat means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there\u2019s one chart that encompasses 2024\u2019s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out.\nFor example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic \u2014 significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week\u2019s gains.\nZooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla\u2019s membership in this informal \u2014 but important \u2014 cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year.\nPerhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark \u2014 who\u2019s above it and who\u2019s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors.\nNvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies \u2014 30% of the index \u2014 that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market\u2019s broadening and rotation.\nSince the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek\u2019s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven.\n\u201cIf one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cOur own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.\u201d\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about.\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech.\nCramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted.\n\u201c... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.\u201d\nCramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day\u2019s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn\u2019t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts.\n\u201cSee, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.\u201d\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\nHe addressed the \u201calleged earnings disappointment,\u201d clarifying that he chose the term \u201calleged\u201d because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts.\nStory Continues\nHe reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment.\nConcluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked:\n\u201cBut the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nCramer mentioned that Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock did not see highs that some of its peers did. He also commented on the latest news about iPhone sales. He said:\n\u201cSee today we've got some negative news about iPhone sales. Not enough to make me wanna sell, but enough to ding the stock. And that wasn't just analyst reports, you also got a number from Verizon that didn't jive with the thesis that Apple iPhones are selling well\u2026 I would own, not trade Apple.\u201d\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), widely recognized for its groundbreaking iPhone, has solidified its reputation as one of the most respected companies in history. Currently, the company is approaching a crucial upgrade cycle, largely driven by innovations in artificial intelligence. However, recent market reactions indicate some caution. Following the third-quarter results from Verizon, the company\u2019s shares experienced a decline.\nAnalyst Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson highlighted Verizon\u2019s low upgrade rate of 3.0% for retail postpaid connections, a drop from 3.4% in the same quarter the previous year when the last iPhone was launched.\nMoffett pointed out that with only two weeks of iPhone 16 sales included in Verizon\u2019s Q3 data, it is premature to conclude that the upcoming Apple cycle will be smaller than last year. Nonetheless, he noted that this was not an encouraging start. In a similar vein, AT&T CEO John Stankey remarked during his company\u2019s earnings call that initial iPhone sales figures were slightly down compared to the previous year.\nOn October 23, according to TipRanks, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that recent surveys revealed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has reduced its orders for the iPhone 16 by approximately 10 million units for the fourth quarter of 2024 through the first half of 2025. Most of these reductions affected the non-Pro models, leading to a new production estimate of 84 million units for the second half of 2024, down from around 88 million.\nConsequently, total iPhone production forecasts for the upcoming quarters have also been adjusted, now projected at about 80 million, 45 million, and 39 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, the first quarter of 2025, and the second quarter of 2025, respectively. While some investors are hopeful that advancements in Apple Intelligence could significantly increase iPhone shipments in the near future, Kuo believes that the recent order reductions indicate such optimistic expectations may not be realized in the immediate future.\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Sam Altman-backed nuclear power company Oklo (OKLO) has boomed on the stock market over the past month as investors look to nuclear energy as the next big AI trade.\nShares in the company, which is designing so-called small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), have surged nearly 140% over the past month on Big Tech\u2019s growing interest in nuclear power. SMRs are designed to produce cheaper, faster, greener energy than traditional nuclear facilities.\n\u2022 USD\n(OKLO)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAmazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) in mid-October announced substantial investments in SMR projects as they look to balance their climate goals with the growing energy demands of the data centers powering their various AI software. Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison announced in September that the company intends to build a data center powered by SMRs.\n\u201cA nuclear power renaissance is underway with nuclear increasingly viewed as a solution which solves both the increased need for baseload power and the need to decarbonize,\u201d wrote Craig-Hallum analyst Eric Stine in a recent note to investors. Baseload power refers to the day-to-day energy demand on an electrical grid.\nStine said Google and Amazon\u2019s investments are \u201ctruly just the beginning of a multi-decade megatrend.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs estimates that global data center power consumption will grow 160% by 2030, driven by demand from artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, separate data from the International Atomic Energy Agency shows nuclear power production in North America potentially doubling by 2050.\nStocks of other firms making similar tech to Oklo\u2019s, such as NuScale (SM\u0192R) and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE), also surged following news of Google's and Amazon's investments on Oct. 14 and Oct. 16, respectively, before paring gains this week.\n\u2022 USD\n(NNE)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n\u201cThe opportunity is so massive here in the market that there's going to be a good number of folks that are successful,\u201d Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte told Yahoo Finance.\nIn fact, the SMR market could grow to $300 billion by 2040, according to research cited by Citi analysts.\nToo many 'ifs'\nOklo went public in May through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, AltC Acquisition Corp., which Altman co-founded. In addition to Altman, Cathie Wood and Peter Thiel are on its list of investors.\nSam Altman owned a 2.6% stake in the company, according to a regulatory filing in June. He became chair of Oklo in 2024 after serving as its CEO for three years.\nSam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI as well as chairman of Oklo, speaks during the Italian Tech Week 2024. (Stefano Guidi/Getty Images) \u00b7 Stefano Guidi via Getty Images\nWhile Oklo was founded in 2013, well ahead of the AI boom, the energy needs of artificial intelligence have been a boon to the firm as it builds its client book, DeWitte said.\nStory Continues\n\u201cAI does make [up] the bulk of our order book that we've talked about,\u201d DeWitte said in an interview. That includes clients in the chip sector as well as data centers, he added. Publicly, the company has said it's working with hyperscalers Equinix and Prometheus Hyperscale. It has yet to disclose any deals with Big Tech firms.\nBut Wall Street analysts caution that the company and its competitors face regulatory and supply chain hurdles before they can produce anywhere near the amount of power needed to run artificial intelligence data centers.\nNuclear projects have been subject to stringent regulations in response to high-profile global nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011. On average, it takes the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission 80 months to approve nuclear plant construction in the US, compared to an average of 54 months in the UK, according to research cited by Canaccord Genuity.\nWhile a number of companies are developing SMRs \u2014 including Bill Gates\u2019 TerraPower \u2014 none have been deployed in the US to date, and long licensing processes mean profitability isn't exactly on the horizon.\nIn Oklo\u2019s first earnings report since going public on Aug. 13, the company reported a net loss of about $53 million for the first six months of the year, wider than the roughly $9 million loss it posted in the year-earlier period.\nMockup of Oklo\u2019s Aurora powerhouse. (Courtesy of Oklo, Illustration by Gensler) \u00b7 (Gensler)\nFuel is also an issue for companies in the space: Many SMRs, such as those of Oklo, NuScale, and TerraPower, require a specific type called high-assay low-enriched uranium, also known as HALEU, which is imported from Russia. There's little to no domestic supply since the West at large has avoided developing a HALEU supply chain. That's because enriched uranium is used in nuclear weapons, according to Canaccord Genuity.\n\u201cA developed Western HALEU supply chain is absent, particularly given efforts to limit enrichment due to concerns over proliferation,\u201d wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas in a note to investors early this year.\nCiting supply constraints and long and difficult licensing processes, Citi\u2019s Vikram Bagri recently reduced his price target on Oklo stock from $11 to $10.\n\u201cThere are too many \u2018ifs\u2019 in this process,\u201d Bagri said. \u201cThe new technology and new nuclear installs, it seems like, will happen only after 2030. After 2030, it remains to be seen who gets successful and how successful they get, how many nuclear reactors we see.\u201d\nBut Seaport analyst Jeffrey Campbell sees Oklo having advantages in the burgeoning market, pointing to its ability to use \u201cmuch cheaper\u201d recycled fuel.\nWhereas a traditional nuclear plant can take billions of dollars to build, Oklo has said the cost of bringing one of its SMRs online is a few hundred million dollars.\nFor his part, DeWitte is optimistic about the future of the market \u2014 and Oklo\u2019s place in it. DeWitte cited mounting bipartisan support to reduce regulatory hurdles and enhance the domestic supply of HALEU. He said Oklo is unique because the company is looking to own and operate its facilities and sell energy directly to customers, rather than the traditional model of licensing its technology to utilities. DeWitte believes this will enable the company to bring its reactors online faster.\nOklo CEO Jacob DeWitte, joined by Lynn Martin, NYSE group president, rings the Opening Bell after Oklo IPO. (Courtesy of Oklo) \u00b7 NYSE\n\u201cIn the world today, where this opportunity is so massive \u2014 diverse customers that need different things, want different things \u2026 you're going to see a diverse ecosystem evolve,\u201d he said.

          "whole_article": "US companies already dominate the global stock market when it comes to size. A new chart from JPMorgan Asset Management shows that's largely expected to continue. The firm attributes the boom to artificial intelligence.\nIn JPM's 2025 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions released on Monday, the team projected that US companies' market cap share of the total global equity market will fall from 64% currently to 60% in 2037. Still, as seen in the chart below, the US (in green) would maintain a large lead over the estimated second-largest share of the global equity market, China (in red).\nJPMorgan Asset Management's global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions Monica Issar told Yahoo Finance during a media roundtable on Monday that the US will continue to lead by market cap share as artificial intelligence benefits expand beyond a few large tech names that have dominated the market rally over the past year to companies in various industries.\nIssar gave two reasons for the prediction: revenue production and margin improvement. The first will come from the money pouring into AI benefiting companies outside of Big Tech. This plays out as tech companies buy AI chips from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), and, as they need more power, these AI operators are forced to spend with companies in the Utilities (XLU) and Energy (XLE) sectors.\nAs AI makes companies more efficient and eliminates the most simple work, eventually cutting down costs, US corporates should get a boost to profit margins.\n\"It's going to be the US predominantly, and then obviously Europe will follow, because you're starting to see some adoption there,\" Issar said.\nTo put the current US dominance in perspective, just Nvidia's (NVDA) market cap alone is larger than most other G7 countries, Apollo chief global economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k wrote in a research note on Thursday. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nTo be sure, Sl\u00f8k noted that this could be a risk to the market overall.\n\"Global equity markets, including retirement allocations to equities, are basically leveraged to Nvidia,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote. \"Let\u2019s hope the value of Nvidia doesn\u2019t decline significantly.\"\nOthers have a more sanguine view of the AI superpower's dominance, though. In a recent research note detailing why the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could average more than 10% annual returns over the next decade, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed to the US being at the forefront of AI adoption and well positioned to dominate amid the technology's \"global adoption.\"\nStory Continues\nColas wrote the odds that a non-US tech company will rise over the next decade and unseat the large tech companies currently driving the US market share like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are \"almost zero.\"\n\"The US continues to dominate global venture capital,\" Colas wrote. \"If a new US business does eventually threaten their preeminence, then it will certainly go public, be in the S&P 500, and drive future returns.\"\nThe national flag is installed for a campaign rally of former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outside of Christ Chapel in Zebulon, Georgia, on Oct. 23, 2024.

Their smaller, standardized designs were expected to usher in a new era for an industry historically plagued by cost overruns and safety concerns.\nBut as major tech firms, including Google (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN), turn to advanced technologies in hopes of powering their AI ambitions with a low carbon footprint, skeptics are raising questions about their viability, largely because no commercial SMR has been built in the US yet.\nDespite the talk of a simplified process, there are only three SMRs operational worldwide \u2014 two in Russia and one in China.\n\"Nobody knows how long they\u2019re going to take to build,\" said David Schlissel, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis who has been critical of SMRs. \"Nobody knows how expensive they\u2019re going to be to build. We don't know how effective they will be in addressing climate change because it may take them 10 to 15 years to build them.\"\nThe core module of the ACP100 multi-purpose, small modular pressurized water reactor (PWR), also referred to as the Linglong One, is transferred to a ship on July 14, 2023, in Dalian, Liaoning Province of China. (Liu Xuan/VCG via Getty Images) \u00b7 VCG via Getty Images\nNuclear power has received renewed interest because of the global push to move away from fossil fuels to reduce harmful emissions driving climate change. Although wind and solar power offer prevalent, low-cost energy options, nuclear remains an attractive clean alternative, in large part because it can run 24/7 in any season and has a smaller footprint.\nSMRs have offered the most promise. Unlike traditional nuclear plants that have been costly and time-consuming, modular reactors are one-third the size, with a power capacity of 300 megawatts or less. The nuclear industry has touted their efficiency and cost savings, as SMRs are built in factories and assembled on-site.\n\"It reduces the risk associated with the project,\" said Jacopo Buongiorno, a professor of nuclear engineering at MIT. \"For an investor, ... you may recover your investment quicker and with fewer uncertainties in terms of project execution.\"\n'The technology is evolving'\nYet, in many ways, the hurdles facing this new generation of reactors have mirrored the old. Advanced reactor designs have taken longer than projected. Those delays have added to cost overruns.\nOregon-based NuScale (SMR) became the first company to get approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build SMRs in 2022, but the company canceled plans to deploy six reactors in Idaho last year. The announcement came after costs for the project, scheduled for completion in 2030, ballooned from $5 billion to $9 billion.\nBuongiorno said the buildout has been complicated by the array of technologies tested within individual projects. While all SMRs utilize uranium as fuel, its form and application within reactors differ depending on the company and its technology. That\u2019s dramatically different from existing nuclear power plants, which all use uranium dioxide, he said.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe technology is evolving. We expect the performance of these reactors to be different. But the big question marks are ... what's going to be the reliability? How reliable this technology is going to be, given that we don't have a lot of experience?\u201d Buongiorno said. \u201cEqually, if not more important, what's going to be the cost?\u201d\nAI a 'game changer'\nX-energy CEO Clay Sell said demand has been part of the problem until now.\nArtificial intelligence has changed that calculation, largely because of the energy needs associated with powering data centers that drive AI models, Sell said. Goldman Sachs estimates the advanced technology will contribute to a 160% increase in data center power demand by 2030.\nEarlier this month, Amazon announced a $500 million investment in the development of SMRs, including funding for X-energy. That funding will help X-energy complete the design of its standard plant and construct the first facility that will manufacture the fuel used in those plants, Sell said, calling the investment a \u201cgame changer.\u201d\n\u201cA significant portion of the increased electricity demand in the United States for the next 25 years is going to come from AI,\" Sell said. \"It could be as high as 10%, 20%.\u201d\nKairos Power CEO Mike Laufer, who inked a purchase agreement deal with Google, said his company is still in the process of pursuing non-nuclear demonstrations of the technology. Any \u201ccost certainty\u201d would hinge on a successful demonstration and the company\u2019s ability to manufacture in-house, he said.\n\u201c[Cost certainty] has been very elusive in this space,\u201d he said.\nAerial view of the construction site of Linglong-1 (ACP-100), the world's first onshore commercial small modular reactor (SMR), on July 4, 2024, in Changjiang Li Autonomous County, Hainan Province of China. (Wang Jian/VCG via Getty Images) \u00b7 VCG via Getty Images\nThere are other challenges beyond cost, including a lengthy regulatory approval process and what to do with all of the nuclear waste.\nWhile nuclear companies maintaining a smaller footprint will mean less waste, a study by Stanford University found that SMRs would increase the volume of nuclear waste \u201cby factors of 2 to 30.\u201d\nSchlissel argues that all of the money spent on small reactors should instead go to wind and solar power and battery storage, which are proven to reduce carbon emissions and cost less to produce.\nBuongiorno countered that nuclear reactors have a longer shelf life. While the upfront costs may be higher, reactors have a lifespan of 60 to 100 years, he said. With the smaller footprint, SMRs can also be built closer to data centers, minimizing infrastructure costs, he added.\nThe Department of Energy says nuclear energy is critical to transitioning the country away from fossil fuels. The agency has set aside $900 million in funding for the development of SMRs.\nThe Energy Department estimates the US will need approximately 700-900 GW of additional clean, firm power generation capacity to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, adding that nuclear energy already provides nearly half of carbon-free electricity in the country.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up by 2.5% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company\u2019s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Amazon.com's ROE in this article.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n19% = US$44b \u00f7 US$236b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nAmazon.com's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE\nTo begin with, Amazon.com seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 21%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 14% seen over the past five years by Amazon.com.\nWe then performed a comparison between Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 15% in the same 5-year period.\npast-earnings-growth\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\nIs Amazon.com Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nGiven that Amazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nStory Continues\nConclusion\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Dow stocks.\nSince its introduction in 1896, the Dow Jones has undergone significant changes but remains a popular benchmark for measuring the economy and the overall stock market outlook. While the Index has gained 13% year to date, it has lagged the S&P 500, up by 21% over the same period.\nThe significant underperformance is because the Dow is mostly made up of blue-chip American companies, most of which have come under pressure amid deteriorating macroeconomics. While the Index is mostly made up of financial services companies at 23%, followed by technology at 20%, it has felt the full brunt of\u00a0 deteriorating economic conditions.\nREAD ALSO: 8 Worst Performing Tech Stocks in 2024 and 10 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2024.\nThe U.S. economy is reeling from the effects of high interest rates, resulting in a slowdown in the labour market, and the manufacturing sector has significantly affected the Dow holdings. Additionally, the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have rattled investors' sentiments, resulting in most of them shunning equities in favor of safe havens like bonds and treasuries.\nThe uncertainty around the upcoming U.S. presidential election has only exacerbated the situation, with investors shunning stocks that would be affected mainly by a change of policies once there is a leadership change at the White House.\u00a0 According to analysts at Bank of America, who ends up in the White House and Congress could have a significant impact on critical corners of the stock market.\n\u201cProfits accelerating are far more important than who is sitting in the Oval Office. But politics can make or break sub-sectors,\u201d the firm wrote in a research note to investors.\nAmid the headwinds, the overall equity market has been trading higher, with major indices led by the Dow and the S&P 500 rallying to record highs. The strong gains have come on most companies delivering solid financial results and shrugging off the effects of high interest rates. Nevertheless the rallies have resulted in overstretched valuations, raising serious concerns for the investment community.\n\u201cThe market had moved into overbought territory, making it vulnerable to anything it perceives as negative \u2026 It\u2019s now worried that the Fed has not declared victory on inflation, and not to mention, the concerns post-election,\u201d said LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Krosby.\nStory Continues\nA resilient U.S. economy that has steered clear of recession has helped support most stocks in the Dow, helping fuel the upward momentum. The International Monetary Fund thinks growth in the U.S. will remain robust. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF increased its estimate for U.S. GDP in 2024 to 2.8% from its 2.6% forecast in July while raising its 2025 growth forecast for the country. It\u2019s the only advanced economy with its economic trajectory revised upwards for both years by the IMF. Nevertheless, it has warned of slowdowns in emerging markets.\n\u201cProjected slowdowns in the largest emerging market and developing economies imply a longer path to close the income gaps between poor and rich countries. Having growth stuck in low gear could also further exacerbate income inequality within economies,\u201d the IMF warned.\nWith the U.S. economy expected to remain resilient as the Federal Reserve pushes forth with interest rate cuts, Dow stocks that have underperformed are well poised to bounce back. A lower interest rate environment on the back of improved economic conditions heading into year-end would make the case for the best Dow stocks to buy, according to analysts.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts, we started by analyzing the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We screened these stocks based on average price targets, focusing on stocks with significant upside potential. Finally, we ranked these companies in ascending order based on their price target upside as of October 23. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nAverage Upside Potential as of October 23: 18.17%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAccording to analysts, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is arguably one of the best Dow stocks to buy, owing to the diversified nature of its business empire and tremendous opportunities for growth. While the company is best known for its e-commerce operations, it\u2019s become a key player in the artificial intelligence race, strengthening its growth prospects in cloud computing.\nAn increasingly important aspect of Amazon's operations is its third-party seller services division. With little risk, it is its second-largest revenue segment and offers a pleasant profit boost. It makes sense that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides this service to independent sellers who wish to join the Amazon network, given that it has established a sizable warehouse footprint and logistics network to transport goods from seller to buyer. Because third-party sellers are in charge of maintaining the product inventory, the business benefits from this.\nWith an annualized run rate of $50 billion and a 20% growth rate, Amazon's advertising division is now a significant player in digital advertising, trailing only Facebook, Instagram, and Search. However, advertising should continue proliferating as Amazon can better target ads to customers more likely to purchase by connecting its vast customer data. Additionally, there are still unexplored opportunities in this segment.\nFor Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), advertising is a rising star. With a 20% increase in revenue in the second quarter, it is currently the segment with the fastest growth rate, and it is not finished yet. Although it has experienced rapid expansion, management says it thinks video advertising is still in its infancy. Its commerce business also benefits significantly from advertisements, contributing to the recent profit margin increase.\nGoing by the tremendous opportunities for growth to generate long-term value, Amazon is rated as a strong buy with an average price target of $224.16, implying an 18.17% upside potential.\nAccording to Insider Monkey, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is currently the most widely held stock among hedge funds. As of Q2 2024, 308 hedge funds had stakes in the company, reflecting its strong appeal to institutional investors.\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) continued growth is driven by its strong performance in AWS and advertising, which grew 19% and 20%, respectively. E-commerce growth moderated to 9.3%, likely due to softer consumer demand.\nOverall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nTesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company\u2019s quarterly results with a flurry of buying.\nA 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d counterparts \u2014 and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began.\nThat means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there\u2019s one chart that encompasses 2024\u2019s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out.\nFor example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic \u2014 significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week\u2019s gains.\nZooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla\u2019s membership in this informal \u2014 but important \u2014 cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year.\nPerhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark \u2014 who\u2019s above it and who\u2019s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors.\nNvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies \u2014 30% of the index \u2014 that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market\u2019s broadening and rotation.\nSince the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek\u2019s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven.\n\u201cIf one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cOur own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.\u201d\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

After all, there's more to one's investing life than modeling out 2050 profits for Nvidia (NVDA) and wondering whether Tesla (TSLA) will haul in $10 billion in sales from humanoid robots.\nIn the spirit of this, here are a couple of convos I had this week that may leave you thinking (hopefully).\nAI meets extra spicy hot sauce: I was at a CEO dinner this week where an analyst specializing in AI proceeded to share the deep impact to businesses as AI proliferates. I tend to agree the way business is done will change profoundly, and it'll include a good bit of job loss.\nAn example of AI's impact is in Cholula hot sauce. Its parent, spice maker McCormick (MKC), held an investor day this week.\n\"We have used generative AI to really understand where all the commentary was going [for hot sauce], we learned there were some Cholula lovers out there that wanted a hotter version. So in January, we are launching an extra-hot version of Cholula,\" McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination Overtime.\nMcCormick reiterated its long-term sales growth guidance of 4% to 6% and earnings growth of 9% to 11%. Shares are up 16% year to date compared to the 22% gain for the S&P 500.\nYou can catch that full spicy segment here.\nBuilding a 21st-century media company: The traditional media industry continues to be disrupted by everything from new streaming networks to creators posting on YouTube. Why else do you think Disney (DIS) said this week its CEO Bob Iger was sticking around until 2026 (he was rumored to be leaving in 2025)?

In charge of bringing that vision to life? Dude Perfect's first-ever CEO Andrew Yaffe, who took the job several weeks ago.\nStory Continues\n\"I think people underestimate how big YouTube is,\" Yaffe told me of the Google-owned (GOOG) platform on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here). \"YouTube is the biggest media platform in the US in terms of consumption.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Netflix's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n51% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders\nInsiders have sold recently\nIf you want to know who really controls Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nAnd as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 9.7% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 87%.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Netflix.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Netflix\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Netflix?\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nNetflix already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Netflix's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Netflix. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nStory Continues\nInsider Ownership Of Netflix\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur information suggests that Netflix, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.9b worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nNext Steps:\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Netflix better, we need to consider many other factors.\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The company reported revenue growth of 2.8% QoQ and 15% YoY, with revenue beating estimates by $57 million. GAAP EPS also exceeded expectations at $5.40, while subscriber numbers surged to 282.7 million, outpacing estimates by 4 million. The net income margin reached an impressive 24.1%, up 450 basis points compared to the same quarter last year, signaling operational efficiency despite competitive pressures.\nDespite facing stiff competition from peers like Disney and Amazon Prime, Netflix\u2019s Q3 results have displayed its ability to maintain its competitive edge. Netflix's strategy of expanding beyond traditional streaming, into areas like live events, gaming, advertising, and international markets, has broadened its total addressable market. The platform's ability to secure high-profile events, such as the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match and NFL games, exemplifies its ability to capture large, engaged audiences.\nNetflix\u2019s approach to flexible pricing models has also been key to sustaining growth. In some regions, such as Japan, the U.S., and Spain, prices have been raised, while in other markets, the company has introduced lower-priced, ad-supported plans. These ad-supported tiers now account for over 50% of new sign-ups, offering a solution for price-sensitive consumers while allowing Netflix to monetize a broader audience. However, the introduction of ad-supported plans also reflects underlying consumer weakness, highlighting the company's need to balance affordability with profitability.\nThe ad platform, still in its early stages, offers significant long-term potential. Despite growing competition in the digital advertising space, Netflix's unmatched audience engagement provides a unique value proposition to advertisers. As companies increasingly invest in digital ads, Netflix stands out by offering premium placements in highly anticipated content, positioning itself as a future leader in this lucrative market. With strong user engagement, the company can command high CPMs, giving it a competitive edge over other platforms.\nStory Continues\nInternational expansion remains another key opportunity for Netflix. Revenue growth of 16% YoY in both the U.S. and Canada and EMEA markets, alongside 19% growth in Asia Pacific and 9% in LATAM, demonstrates Netflix's ability to scale globally, although volatility remains in emerging markets.\nBasically, the bullish thesis on Netflix stems from the fact that the company is diversifying its revenue streams and expanding its total addressable market (TAM). Netflix\u2019s venturing into live events, gaming, and introducing lower-cost, ad-supported plans are opening up new growth opportunities beyond traditional streaming.

Many are closely watching trends and data that could impact future growth and stability.\nTom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently shared his insights on the current market trends during an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 14. He acknowledged that he underestimated the strength of the market, noting that it has been surprisingly resilient despite expectations of volatility leading up to the 2024 election. Lee highlighted that there is a significant amount of cash\u2014about $6 trillion\u2014sitting on the sidelines, which has contributed to the market\u2019s stability. He observed that many investors had anticipated a recession, but instead, companies have shown strong earnings and resilience.\nLee also mentioned that the Federal Reserve is likely to adopt a supportive stance as inflation data continues to trend toward their 2% target. He believes that regardless of who wins the upcoming election, stocks are likely to perform well in the following year. Lee pointed out that markets tend to thrive on visibility and certainty, suggesting that if one candidate appears to be gaining an advantage, it could lead to a more favorable trading environment before the election. Overall, he remains optimistic about the market\u2019s outlook.\nS&P 500 and Dow Reach New Heights Ahead of Election Season\nOn October 18, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached new record highs, marking six consecutive weeks of gains for these major indices.

Despite potential market volatility leading up to the upcoming election, some analysts believe that stocks may continue to rise through November.\nRob Williams, a chief investment strategist at Sage Advisory, noted that this trend is unusual for an election year, where markets typically hesitate before improving post-election. He suggested that investors might be optimistic about a possible victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose policies are seen as more favorable for businesses in terms of regulations and taxes.\nStory Continues\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners.

Specification data available for 998 shipped servers show they were equipped with Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips.\nThe servers \u2014 and the chips they contain \u2014 are on a list of items restricted by the US and the European Union \u201cto target sensitive sectors in Russia\u2019s military industrial complex.\u201d Yet the shipments, worth $300 million and imported by two Russian trading companies, Main Chain Ltd. and I.S LLC, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022, the data showed.\nShreya did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and no one was available to do so during two visits to its office.\nThe findings underscore the holes in western government attempts to shut off Moscow\u2019s access to dual-use technology with potential military applications, as well as the cutting-edge nature of the equipment being shipped. India is increasingly the intermediary of choice: It\u2019s now the second-biggest supplier after China of restricted technology to Russia, Bloomberg reported Oct. 12.\nAndriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s chief of staff, complained in a post on X that Russia is still receiving components used for electronic intelligence and warfare systems despite western sanctions. \u201cNo one should profit from the lives of Ukrainians,\u201d he said Oct. 7.\nWhile India is the point of transshipment, trade data suggest that Malaysia is in fact the origin. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim met with President Vladimir Putin in Russia in September, and hailed the \u201cenormous potential\u201d to enhance regional trade relations, including through advanced technologies.\nStory Continues\nShipping documents of at least 834 PowerEdge XE9680 units destined for Russia showed their country of origin as Malaysia. Indian import data for March-August 2024 reveals that 1,407 of the same Dell units were imported to India from Malaysia. Neither Malaysia\u2019s Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry nor the Prime Minister\u2019s Office responded to an email seeking comments.\nThe tech companies themselves are obligated to follow sanctions rules and monitor any sales of sensitive products. In a statement, Dell said that it had ceased selling and offering services or support for products in Russia in February 2022, immediately following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and maintains \u201ca strict trade compliance program.\u201d Nvidia and AMD said that they work with partners to ensure that sales are in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with export controls, and take appropriate action if any violations are identified.\nDoing business with Russia is not illegal in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is not party to the multiple rounds of US and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. Long dependent upon Russia for military equipment, New Delhi stepped in to buy its crude as European countries cut off oil imports over the war \u2014 and is signaling that it will continue to do so for as long as Moscow gives bigger discounts than other producers. During an Oct. 22 meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, Modi referred to \u201cour close and deepening\u201d relations.\nThat role has put India on the radar of western governments. US and EU officials have traveled to India in recent months as part of efforts to encourage the government to act to stop the shipments, according to people familiar with the trips. The visits come amid signs of mounting exasperation with India for its role procuring goods for Russia\u2019s war.\nUS Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo sent a letter to the Confederation of Indian Industry this summer warning that foreign financial institutions trading with Russia\u2019s military industrial base risked being sanctioned. Despite the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to keep Modi\u2019s government onside in its competition with China, New Delhi has shown little engagement with the US concerns, a senior US official said.\nTransshipment of battlefield products via India has ramped up since December of last year, according to David O\u2019Sullivan, the EU\u2019s chief sanctions official. In a briefing to reporters, he attributed the increase to \u201cthe huge volume of rupees\u201d Russia has accrued from selling oil, rather than Indian policy. The EU has already sanctioned a few entities based in India.\nIndia has looked into US allegations and taken action as needed after Washington flagged that some Indian companies were supplying dual-use technology to Russia, said people familiar with the government\u2019s stance, asking not to be named discussing sensitive matters of diplomacy. That matter is now closed, the people said, adding that Shreya Life Sciences did not feature on the list.\nA spokesperson for India\u2019s Trade Ministry didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment. The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment.\nIndia\u2019s exports of controlled and dual-use goods and technologies are in full compliance with its national laws and regulations and its international obligations on non-proliferation, said a senior Indian official who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Bloomberg has previously reported that the vast majority of restricted goods enter Russia via re-exports from third countries such as China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Some of those trades involve often unwitting subsidiaries and subcontractors of western firms as well as networks of intermediaries who source from them.\nInformation on those companies involved is rare \u2014 and the paper trail leading to Shreya is what makes the drugmaker stand out.\nThe company was founded in Moscow in 1995 by Sujit Kumar Singh just as Russia was on the verge of economic breakdown, offering opportunities for enterprising individuals able to navigate the chaos of those years. Singh, the company\u2019s CEO, was unavailable for comment despite email, telephone and text requests sent to Shreya.\nIn an article for the Economic Times published in 2002, Singh wrote of Shreya\u2019s initial role in developing a marketing and distribution network at a time when \u201cafter the collapse of the Soviet Union the pharmaceutical market was practically reduced to zero.\u201d He also expressed hopes that a visit to India by Putin the same year would \u201cimpart a new impetus and greater depth and content to Indo-Russian relations.\u201d\nRecords from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs database show that Shreya began life as a distribution and marketing company of pharmaceutical drugs, over time acquiring several companies to create its own manufacturing plants for generic drugs like insulin, antibiotics, anti-malaria and gastrointestinal medicines. Indeed, between January 2022 and August 2024, it sold $22 million worth of pharmaceutical products to Russia, trade data shows. Russia is listed on the company website as the first among six major markets for its international exports.\nThat dependence on Russia has proven to be a liability in the past. Shreya began seeing a dip in operating revenues in 2014-15 coinciding with Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea that led to sanctions and a collapse in the ruble, according to rating agency Crisil. As Shreya relied on sales of its drugs to Russian clients and to its own entity based in Moscow, Shreya Life Sciences LLC, the company began bleeding losses.\nThe drugmaker defaulted on 1.9 billion rupees ($23 million) of bank loans in March 2015. While its bankers \u2014 including the State Bank of India and the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. \u2014 restructured its debt, the Bank of India Ltd. filed a suit against the company under the bankruptcy law in 2019, only to later withdraw the petition after the matter was settled out of court.\nShreya returned to profitability in the following years. But the biggest lifeline for the Indian concern came from state-owned Promsvyazbank PJSC in Moscow. The bank\u2019s head is Peter Fradkov, son of the former chief of Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service, Mikhail Fradkov. Both the bank and Fradkov junior are subject to international sanctions.\nBetween 2011 and 2013, Shreya borrowed $86 million from the Russian bank, in the form of a foreign currency loan which was mortgaged against shares owned by Sujit Kumar Singh. The money was used to invest in equity shares of Shreya Life Sciences LLC in Moscow, which in turn used the money to pay for the import of pharmaceutical products from the Indian entity. The loan effectively helped keep the company afloat as the drugmaker sold a significant amount of its products to its own subsidiary.\nLater, in 2018, as other financial institutions grew wary of tightening western sanctions, Russia turned the lender into the key funder of its defense industry. Throughout that time, the bank seems to have allowed Shreya to defer its repayments consistently, as cash flow payments toward its borrowings were a fraction of what was due. As of 2022-23, the company had 7.6 billion rupees in borrowings of which 85% is owed to Promsvyazbank. An email to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.\nMeantime, local drug inspectors found deficiencies in insulin injections manufactured by Shreya in 2019, while its products were found to be \u201cnot of standard quality\u201d most recently in April by the Central Drug Laboratory in Kolkata.\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Shreya began branching out into technology shipments.\nThe first record of non-medical exports by Shreya during the period examined by Bloomberg appeared in September 2022, when it shipped an assortment of computer hardware to Russia worth $755,333. The recipient was Lanprint Ltd., a Russian trading company which was later added to the US sanctioned company list, in September 2023. It sold equipment to another company, Silkway LLC, which was sanctioned the same month.\nShreya stopped dealing with both companies two months before they were sanctioned and started selling to Main Chain, which is not on the US list of sanctioned entities.\nMain Chain was registered as a company in Russia on Jan. 25, 2023, with Anastasia Obukhova its general director. She is listed on a Russian business portal as holding the same post for two previous companies, a tourism agency and a tour operator, both of which were liquidated. Each had declared capital of 10,000 rubles (about $130-$200), so Main Chain is a considerable step up. The company states on its website that it \u201cimports and wholesales computer equipment from various foreign manufacturers.\u201d An email and calls to Main Chain went unanswered.\nShreya\u2019s exports to Main Chain and I. S surged in April this year, when it ramped up sales of Dell\u2019s PowerEdge XE9680 at an average price of $260,000. These servers come under HS code 847150, part of the dual-use goods list that aims to curb the Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. The list, drawn up by the EU in conjunction with the US, the UK and Japan, is based partly on tech identified on the battlefield.\nShipping documents show the imports were ordered from Malaysia by Dell International Services India Private Ltd., a Dell subsidiary, and the supplier was recorded as Dell Global BV (Singapore Branch), another subsidiary.\nDell said it requires distributors and resellers \u201cto follow all applicable global regulations and export controls,\u201d and invests in tools and resources to help prevent and detect potential product diversion. \u201cIf a partner is not adhering to these obligations, we take swift and appropriate action, up to and including termination of our relationship,\u201d the company said.\nMain Chain sourced technology products from a second Indian company, Hayers Infotech Private Limited. Together, Shreya and Hayers Infotech exported $434 million worth of high-tech goods to Russia since February 2022.\nHayers Infotech is registered at the same Mumbai address as Shreya Life Sciences. A discrete plaque at the top floor of Shreya\u2019s offices bears the name, Hayers Infotech Pvt Ltd.\n\u2014 With assistance from Alberto Nardelli, Anthony Halpin, Brody Ford, Ian King, Mackenzie Hawkins, Sudhi Ranjan Sen, Niki Koswanage, and Anisah Shukry\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

          "whole_article": "US companies already dominate the global stock market when it comes to size. A new chart from JPMorgan Asset Management shows that's largely expected to continue. The firm attributes the boom to artificial intelligence.\nIn JPM's 2025 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions released on Monday, the team projected that US companies' market cap share of the total global equity market will fall from 64% currently to 60% in 2037. Still, as seen in the chart below, the US (in green) would maintain a large lead over the estimated second-largest share of the global equity market, China (in red).\nJPMorgan Asset Management's global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions Monica Issar told Yahoo Finance during a media roundtable on Monday that the US will continue to lead by market cap share as artificial intelligence benefits expand beyond a few large tech names that have dominated the market rally over the past year to companies in various industries.\nIssar gave two reasons for the prediction: revenue production and margin improvement. The first will come from the money pouring into AI benefiting companies outside of Big Tech. This plays out as tech companies buy AI chips from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), and, as they need more power, these AI operators are forced to spend with companies in the Utilities (XLU) and Energy (XLE) sectors.\nAs AI makes companies more efficient and eliminates the most simple work, eventually cutting down costs, US corporates should get a boost to profit margins.\n\"It's going to be the US predominantly, and then obviously Europe will follow, because you're starting to see some adoption there,\" Issar said.\nTo put the current US dominance in perspective, just Nvidia's (NVDA) market cap alone is larger than most other G7 countries, Apollo chief global economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k wrote in a research note on Thursday. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nTo be sure, Sl\u00f8k noted that this could be a risk to the market overall.\n\"Global equity markets, including retirement allocations to equities, are basically leveraged to Nvidia,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote. \"Let\u2019s hope the value of Nvidia doesn\u2019t decline significantly.\"\nOthers have a more sanguine view of the AI superpower's dominance, though. In a recent research note detailing why the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could average more than 10% annual returns over the next decade, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed to the US being at the forefront of AI adoption and well positioned to dominate amid the technology's \"global adoption.\"\nStory Continues\nColas wrote the odds that a non-US tech company will rise over the next decade and unseat the large tech companies currently driving the US market share like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are \"almost zero.\"\n\"The US continues to dominate global venture capital,\" Colas wrote. \"If a new US business does eventually threaten their preeminence, then it will certainly go public, be in the S&P 500, and drive future returns.\"\nThe national flag is installed for a campaign rally of former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outside of Christ Chapel in Zebulon, Georgia, on Oct. 23, 2024.

It's market cap briefly touched $3.5 trillion on Friday. However, this meteoric rise has raised questions about its valuation. Is the future already priced into the stock, or are there still significant upside opportunities?\nThe AI Gold Rush\nNvidia's GPUs have become the de facto standard for AI and machine learning applications. The company's powerful chips are essential for training and running complex AI models, driving demand from both consumers and enterprise customers.\nThis surge in demand has translated into impressive financial performance for Nvidia. The company has consistently delivered strong revenue and earnings growth, fueled by the AI boom.\nThe Valuation Question\nWhile Nvidia's growth prospects are undeniably strong, its valuation has reached stratospheric levels. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is significantly higher than the industry average and the broader market. That's understandable for a fast-growing stock. Assuming that NVDA becomes a more mature stock in a few years and keeps growing at the same rate the entire stock market grows. A mature but growing company usually gets a price-earnings ratio of around 20. This means currently NVDA's stock price implies that it will be generating after tax profits of $175 billion a year if it manages to retain its dominance in the chip industry.\nOver the last 12 month period NVDA generated $96 billion in sales and $53 billion in net income. So, basically, investors basically assume that NVDA will be able to triple its revenue and profits until it becomes a more mature company.\nIf that happens, NVDA stock will return zero percent. The investors who are buying NVDA stock today are assuming that Nvidia will deliver even better results than tripling its revenue and profits. I personally own NVDA, but I am not convinced that the company can deliver these lofty expectations.\nWhile Nvidia's future looks promising, investors should exercise caution and consider the risks associated with its high valuation. It's important to assess whether the current price reflects the company's long-term growth potential or if there's a bubble forming.\nWhile I acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, my conviction lies in the belief that some other AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.

The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks \u2014 Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet.\nThe debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence.

Whether they can reverse that trend will go a long way to determining if the rally in equities can keep going.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nThe five biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index by market capitalization \u2014 Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. \u2014 are projected to post average earnings growth of 19% in their third-quarter results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. While that would handily top the S&P 500\u2019s projected 4.3% increase, it also would represent their slowest collective expansion in six quarters, BI data shows.\nWhat\u2019s more, the gap between Big Tech and the rest of the market is expected to continue to narrow into 2025, by which time last year\u2019s roughly 35% quarterly earnings growth will be a distant memory. So the question for investors is what this means for these stocks, all of which have soared through the market\u2019s latest rally, and whether they can continue leading indexes higher.\n\u201cSentiment is a lot shakier than in past quarters, and the factors driving the market now feel more negative,\u201d said Andrew Choi, portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments in San Francisco. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the rally is over, but there are opportunities elsewhere, especially as we have these debates about Big Tech valuations, slower earnings momentum, and every story now has some element of controversy or debate that\u2019s weighing on sentiment.\u201d\nMarket Rotates\nFor most of the past two years, the tech giants have led the S&P 500 higher, fueled by relentlessly expanding profits and investors willing to keep paying higher multiples for those earnings. That\u2019s changed in recent months, however.\nSince peaking on July 10 following a 22% rally to start the year, the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, which is comprised of the five S&P behemoths as well as Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc., has fallen 2%. That lags every major sector in the S&P 500, with the utilities, real estate, financial and industrial groups jumping more than 10% and the broader index gaining 3.1% over the same span.\nAll of which has put Big Tech companies in a position they\u2019re unaccustomed to: stock market underdogs. They\u2019re facing greater scrutiny with valuations elevated and questions about when their heavy spending on artificial intelligence initiatives will pay off.\nStory Continues\n\u201cTech ceding its market leadership position could last through the end of the year, but that doesn\u2019t scare us off from owning them long term,\u201d said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a risk that earnings growth is decelerating, and valuations may be a little stretched. But they still bring so much growth to the table And there\u2019s still significant upside to earnings potential over the coming years.\u201d\nWhile Tesla has already posted better than expected third-quarter profits and an encouraging outlook, Big Tech earnings season really kicks off in earnest this week. Google-owner Alphabet reports on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, and Apple and Amazon on Thursday. Nvidia isn\u2019t expected to give results until late November.\nAn AI Future\nAll of this week\u2019s reporters come with their own issues. Microsoft faces concerns about its prospects in AI. Apple has seen early signs of tepid demand for its newest iPhones, although long-term optimism helped send the stock to a record last week. Amazon investors are worried about heavy capital spending eating into profits. And Alphabet has regulatory uncertainty as the US Justice Department investigates it for monopoly practices.\nAI will be a big focus for investors watching the earnings reports, particularly how much the companies are spending on expensive infrastructure. In the third quarter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms are projected to have poured $56 billion into capital expenditures, up 52% from the same period a year ago.\nInvestors generally buy the premise that the companies\u2019 AI investments represent the future of technology. But there\u2019s also little evidence of an immediate burst of profitability for companies like Microsoft, which has integrated AI features into its software products. Disappointment over the disparity between AI spending and outcomes marred an otherwise strong second-quarter earnings season. Now, it\u2019s raising concerns about future profit margins.\n\u201cTop-line gains are starting to get offset by surging AI-related capital spending,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper wrote in a research note. \u201cThat implies peak margins are likely in the past, at least for the near term.\u201d\nBig Tech\u2019s recent underperformance has coincided with souring sentiment from the so-called smart money on Wall Street. Hedge funds have been selling Magnificent Seven stocks over the past several months, and despite modest buying in October net long positions as a percentage of total US exposure are still around the lowest level since mid-2023, according to data from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage desk.\nValuation Conundrum\nDespite the slump in megacap stock prices, many of these companies are carrying valuations that are higher than historical averages. Apple is trading at 32 times estimated profits over the next 12 months, compared with an average of 20 times over the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft is priced at 33 times, compared with an average of 25.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at tech, are earnings really going to grow enough to keep pace with these multiples, or does some of the recent strength reflect a fear of missing out?\u201d said Clark Bellin, chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss the impact of momentum, but at some point the music could stop, and people need to keep their expectations in check this earnings season.\u201d\nTo be sure, Wall Street pros remain overwhelmingly bullish on Big Tech. Roughly 90% of the analysts covering Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia have buy ratings on the stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figures are 83% for Alphabet and 65% for Apple, while the average S&P 500 company sits at about 53%.\nThe reason for the optimism is fairly simple. For all the concerns, they continue to offer above average profit growth, exposure to AI, strong capital returns and less risk than other stock market sectors, according to Parnassus\u2019s Choi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find dominant businesses with this kind of earnings growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to like.\u201d\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nThe earnings avalanche has commenced.\nAnd what does that mean?\nYou've probably missed a lot of other stories that could impact your portfolio. After all, there's more to one's investing life than modeling out 2050 profits for Nvidia (NVDA) and wondering whether Tesla (TSLA) will haul in $10 billion in sales from humanoid robots.\nIn the spirit of this, here are a couple of convos I had this week that may leave you thinking (hopefully).\nAI meets extra spicy hot sauce: I was at a CEO dinner this week where an analyst specializing in AI proceeded to share the deep impact to businesses as AI proliferates. I tend to agree the way business is done will change profoundly, and it'll include a good bit of job loss.\nAn example of AI's impact is in Cholula hot sauce. Its parent, spice maker McCormick (MKC), held an investor day this week.\n\"We have used generative AI to really understand where all the commentary was going [for hot sauce], we learned there were some Cholula lovers out there that wanted a hotter version. So in January, we are launching an extra-hot version of Cholula,\" McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination Overtime.\nMcCormick reiterated its long-term sales growth guidance of 4% to 6% and earnings growth of 9% to 11%. Shares are up 16% year to date compared to the 22% gain for the S&P 500.\nYou can catch that full spicy segment here.\nBuilding a 21st-century media company: The traditional media industry continues to be disrupted by everything from new streaming networks to creators posting on YouTube. Why else do you think Disney (DIS) said this week its CEO Bob Iger was sticking around until 2026 (he was rumored to be leaving in 2025)? He has to leave the business in a much better place than his last exit.\nOne of these disrupters in the past 15 years has been Dude Perfect. The company was started by five friends who went to Texas A&M and rose to fame for viral trick-shot videos posted on YouTube. The company now boasts 60.5 million subscribers and churns out a steady, broader array of content.\nArmed with a new $100 million capital infusion from Highmount Capital, Dude Perfect is gearing up for more unique programming and the build-out of a headquarters in Frisco, Texas. In charge of bringing that vision to life? Dude Perfect's first-ever CEO Andrew Yaffe, who took the job several weeks ago.\nStory Continues\n\"I think people underestimate how big YouTube is,\" Yaffe told me of the Google-owned (GOOG) platform on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here). \"YouTube is the biggest media platform in the US in terms of consumption. Bigger than Netflix (NFLX). And that's growing quickly. It's also the biggest outside the US. It's massive \u2014 it is how people under the age of 34 consume content.\"\nNot massive: Google's stock price year to date. Shares have lagged the S&P 500's 23% gain, rising only 16%.\nListen to more episodes of Opening Bid\nWhy leaders should think about DEI differently this presidential election season\nNvidia stock is still undervalued, BofA analyst argues\nFormer Trump adviser Judy Shelton: Elon Musk is right on the government efficiency front\nBig Blue is a big AI player: So much gets lost on a company's earnings day as traders zoom in on the numbers and a couple of trends on the earnings call. Ultimately this is why I think companies should be reporting twice a year, but that's a discussion for a different day.\nOne number that got lost in IBM's earnings release Wednesday (which led to a shellacking in the stock price as consulting sales missed estimates): $3 billion of AI-related project backing. IBM's veteran CFO Jim Kavanaugh tells me the company is tracking toward adding $1 billion in AI project backlog a quarter.\nThat's huge and aligns with what Kavanaugh thinks is a long runway for AI infrastructure buildout.\n\"In my personal opinion, I think it's going to be the longest [adoption] curve that we'll see also because it'll play in many different industries and many different clients,\" Kavanaugh said.\nThat bullish sentiment was echoed in a convo I had on Opening Bid with BofA analyst Vivek Arya this week, where he went into how AI's buildout will require the use of nuclear power. More insight on that and how it will benefit market darling Nvidia here.\nOur Morning Brief anchor Seana Smith will be diving into IBM's AI future with chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna at our annual Invest conference on Nov. 12.

Marriott, 50, who assumed the chairman role at Marriott (MAR) from his legendary father J.W. \"Bill\" Marriott, Jr., 92, in 2022. David's father \u2014 who is chairman emeritus \u2014 served as chairman for 60 years and CEO for 40 years. Mind-blowing! Bill's parents, Alice Marriott and J. Willard Marriott, founded the company as an A&W root beer stand in 1927.\nSuffice it to say, the younger Marriott hardly does interviews (he travels a lot and has four children) \u2014 so it was a treat to spend time with him on Opening Bid.\n\"I spent several summers doing internships in the kitchen, learning how to prep food, hot food, cold food, and learning how to cook on the line. And, I spent a summer as a bellman and spent some time making beds and working behind the front desk,\" Marriott told me of his on-the-job training.\nThe full pod drop of our chat is at 8:30 a.m. ET on Monday.

          "whole_article": "Sam Altman-backed nuclear power company Oklo (OKLO) has boomed on the stock market over the past month as investors look to nuclear energy as the next big AI trade.\nShares in the company, which is designing so-called small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), have surged nearly 140% over the past month on Big Tech\u2019s growing interest in nuclear power. SMRs are designed to produce cheaper, faster, greener energy than traditional nuclear facilities.\n\u2022 USD\n(OKLO)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAmazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) in mid-October announced substantial investments in SMR projects as they look to balance their climate goals with the growing energy demands of the data centers powering their various AI software. Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison announced in September that the company intends to build a data center powered by SMRs.\n\u201cA nuclear power renaissance is underway with nuclear increasingly viewed as a solution which solves both the increased need for baseload power and the need to decarbonize,\u201d wrote Craig-Hallum analyst Eric Stine in a recent note to investors. Baseload power refers to the day-to-day energy demand on an electrical grid.\nStine said Google and Amazon\u2019s investments are \u201ctruly just the beginning of a multi-decade megatrend.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs estimates that global data center power consumption will grow 160% by 2030, driven by demand from artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, separate data from the International Atomic Energy Agency shows nuclear power production in North America potentially doubling by 2050.\nStocks of other firms making similar tech to Oklo\u2019s, such as NuScale (SM\u0192R) and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE), also surged following news of Google's and Amazon's investments on Oct. 14 and Oct. 16, respectively, before paring gains this week.\n\u2022 USD\n(NNE)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n\u201cThe opportunity is so massive here in the market that there's going to be a good number of folks that are successful,\u201d Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte told Yahoo Finance.\nIn fact, the SMR market could grow to $300 billion by 2040, according to research cited by Citi analysts.\nToo many 'ifs'\nOklo went public in May through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, AltC Acquisition Corp., which Altman co-founded. In addition to Altman, Cathie Wood and Peter Thiel are on its list of investors.\nSam Altman owned a 2.6% stake in the company, according to a regulatory filing in June. He became chair of Oklo in 2024 after serving as its CEO for three years.\nSam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI as well as chairman of Oklo, speaks during the Italian Tech Week 2024. (Stefano Guidi/Getty Images) \u00b7 Stefano Guidi via Getty Images\nWhile Oklo was founded in 2013, well ahead of the AI boom, the energy needs of artificial intelligence have been a boon to the firm as it builds its client book, DeWitte said.\nStory Continues\n\u201cAI does make [up] the bulk of our order book that we've talked about,\u201d DeWitte said in an interview. That includes clients in the chip sector as well as data centers, he added. Publicly, the company has said it's working with hyperscalers Equinix and Prometheus Hyperscale. It has yet to disclose any deals with Big Tech firms.\nBut Wall Street analysts caution that the company and its competitors face regulatory and supply chain hurdles before they can produce anywhere near the amount of power needed to run artificial intelligence data centers.\nNuclear projects have been subject to stringent regulations in response to high-profile global nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011. On average, it takes the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission 80 months to approve nuclear plant construction in the US, compared to an average of 54 months in the UK, according to research cited by Canaccord Genuity.\nWhile a number of companies are developing SMRs \u2014 including Bill Gates\u2019 TerraPower \u2014 none have been deployed in the US to date, and long licensing processes mean profitability isn't exactly on the horizon.\nIn Oklo\u2019s first earnings report since going public on Aug. 13, the company reported a net loss of about $53 million for the first six months of the year, wider than the roughly $9 million loss it posted in the year-earlier period.\nMockup of Oklo\u2019s Aurora powerhouse. (Courtesy of Oklo, Illustration by Gensler) \u00b7 (Gensler)\nFuel is also an issue for companies in the space: Many SMRs, such as those of Oklo, NuScale, and TerraPower, require a specific type called high-assay low-enriched uranium, also known as HALEU, which is imported from Russia. There's little to no domestic supply since the West at large has avoided developing a HALEU supply chain. That's because enriched uranium is used in nuclear weapons, according to Canaccord Genuity.\n\u201cA developed Western HALEU supply chain is absent, particularly given efforts to limit enrichment due to concerns over proliferation,\u201d wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas in a note to investors early this year.\nCiting supply constraints and long and difficult licensing processes, Citi\u2019s Vikram Bagri recently reduced his price target on Oklo stock from $11 to $10.\n\u201cThere are too many \u2018ifs\u2019 in this process,\u201d Bagri said. \u201cThe new technology and new nuclear installs, it seems like, will happen only after 2030. After 2030, it remains to be seen who gets successful and how successful they get, how many nuclear reactors we see.\u201d\nBut Seaport analyst Jeffrey Campbell sees Oklo having advantages in the burgeoning market, pointing to its ability to use \u201cmuch cheaper\u201d recycled fuel.\nWhereas a traditional nuclear plant can take billions of dollars to build, Oklo has said the cost of bringing one of its SMRs online is a few hundred million dollars.\nFor his part, DeWitte is optimistic about the future of the market \u2014 and Oklo\u2019s place in it. DeWitte cited mounting bipartisan support to reduce regulatory hurdles and enhance the domestic supply of HALEU. He said Oklo is unique because the company is looking to own and operate its facilities and sell energy directly to customers, rather than the traditional model of licensing its technology to utilities. DeWitte believes this will enable the company to bring its reactors online faster.\nOklo CEO Jacob DeWitte, joined by Lynn Martin, NYSE group president, rings the Opening Bell after Oklo IPO. (Courtesy of Oklo) \u00b7 NYSE\n\u201cIn the world today, where this opportunity is so massive \u2014 diverse customers that need different things, want different things \u2026 you're going to see a diverse ecosystem evolve,\u201d he said.

          "whole_article": "US companies already dominate the global stock market when it comes to size. A new chart from JPMorgan Asset Management shows that's largely expected to continue. The firm attributes the boom to artificial intelligence.\nIn JPM's 2025 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions released on Monday, the team projected that US companies' market cap share of the total global equity market will fall from 64% currently to 60% in 2037. Still, as seen in the chart below, the US (in green) would maintain a large lead over the estimated second-largest share of the global equity market, China (in red).\nJPMorgan Asset Management's global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions Monica Issar told Yahoo Finance during a media roundtable on Monday that the US will continue to lead by market cap share as artificial intelligence benefits expand beyond a few large tech names that have dominated the market rally over the past year to companies in various industries.\nIssar gave two reasons for the prediction: revenue production and margin improvement. The first will come from the money pouring into AI benefiting companies outside of Big Tech. This plays out as tech companies buy AI chips from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), and, as they need more power, these AI operators are forced to spend with companies in the Utilities (XLU) and Energy (XLE) sectors.\nAs AI makes companies more efficient and eliminates the most simple work, eventually cutting down costs, US corporates should get a boost to profit margins.\n\"It's going to be the US predominantly, and then obviously Europe will follow, because you're starting to see some adoption there,\" Issar said.\nTo put the current US dominance in perspective, just Nvidia's (NVDA) market cap alone is larger than most other G7 countries, Apollo chief global economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k wrote in a research note on Thursday. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nTo be sure, Sl\u00f8k noted that this could be a risk to the market overall.\n\"Global equity markets, including retirement allocations to equities, are basically leveraged to Nvidia,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote. \"Let\u2019s hope the value of Nvidia doesn\u2019t decline significantly.\"\nOthers have a more sanguine view of the AI superpower's dominance, though. In a recent research note detailing why the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could average more than 10% annual returns over the next decade, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed to the US being at the forefront of AI adoption and well positioned to dominate amid the technology's \"global adoption.\"\nStory Continues\nColas wrote the odds that a non-US tech company will rise over the next decade and unseat the large tech companies currently driving the US market share like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are \"almost zero.\"\n\"The US continues to dominate global venture capital,\" Colas wrote. \"If a new US business does eventually threaten their preeminence, then it will certainly go public, be in the S&P 500, and drive future returns.\"\nThe national flag is installed for a campaign rally of former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outside of Christ Chapel in Zebulon, Georgia, on Oct. 23, 2024.

Their smaller, standardized designs were expected to usher in a new era for an industry historically plagued by cost overruns and safety concerns.\nBut as major tech firms, including Google (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN), turn to advanced technologies in hopes of powering their AI ambitions with a low carbon footprint, skeptics are raising questions about their viability, largely because no commercial SMR has been built in the US yet.\nDespite the talk of a simplified process, there are only three SMRs operational worldwide \u2014 two in Russia and one in China.\n\"Nobody knows how long they\u2019re going to take to build,\" said David Schlissel, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis who has been critical of SMRs. \"Nobody knows how expensive they\u2019re going to be to build. We don't know how effective they will be in addressing climate change because it may take them 10 to 15 years to build them.\"\nThe core module of the ACP100 multi-purpose, small modular pressurized water reactor (PWR), also referred to as the Linglong One, is transferred to a ship on July 14, 2023, in Dalian, Liaoning Province of China. (Liu Xuan/VCG via Getty Images) \u00b7 VCG via Getty Images\nNuclear power has received renewed interest because of the global push to move away from fossil fuels to reduce harmful emissions driving climate change. Although wind and solar power offer prevalent, low-cost energy options, nuclear remains an attractive clean alternative, in large part because it can run 24/7 in any season and has a smaller footprint.\nSMRs have offered the most promise. Unlike traditional nuclear plants that have been costly and time-consuming, modular reactors are one-third the size, with a power capacity of 300 megawatts or less. The nuclear industry has touted their efficiency and cost savings, as SMRs are built in factories and assembled on-site.\n\"It reduces the risk associated with the project,\" said Jacopo Buongiorno, a professor of nuclear engineering at MIT. \"For an investor, ... you may recover your investment quicker and with fewer uncertainties in terms of project execution.\"\n'The technology is evolving'\nYet, in many ways, the hurdles facing this new generation of reactors have mirrored the old. Advanced reactor designs have taken longer than projected. Those delays have added to cost overruns.\nOregon-based NuScale (SMR) became the first company to get approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build SMRs in 2022, but the company canceled plans to deploy six reactors in Idaho last year. The announcement came after costs for the project, scheduled for completion in 2030, ballooned from $5 billion to $9 billion.\nBuongiorno said the buildout has been complicated by the array of technologies tested within individual projects. While all SMRs utilize uranium as fuel, its form and application within reactors differ depending on the company and its technology. That\u2019s dramatically different from existing nuclear power plants, which all use uranium dioxide, he said.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe technology is evolving. We expect the performance of these reactors to be different. But the big question marks are ... what's going to be the reliability? How reliable this technology is going to be, given that we don't have a lot of experience?\u201d Buongiorno said. \u201cEqually, if not more important, what's going to be the cost?\u201d\nAI a 'game changer'\nX-energy CEO Clay Sell said demand has been part of the problem until now.\nArtificial intelligence has changed that calculation, largely because of the energy needs associated with powering data centers that drive AI models, Sell said. Goldman Sachs estimates the advanced technology will contribute to a 160% increase in data center power demand by 2030.\nEarlier this month, Amazon announced a $500 million investment in the development of SMRs, including funding for X-energy. That funding will help X-energy complete the design of its standard plant and construct the first facility that will manufacture the fuel used in those plants, Sell said, calling the investment a \u201cgame changer.\u201d\n\u201cA significant portion of the increased electricity demand in the United States for the next 25 years is going to come from AI,\" Sell said. \"It could be as high as 10%, 20%.\u201d\nKairos Power CEO Mike Laufer, who inked a purchase agreement deal with Google, said his company is still in the process of pursuing non-nuclear demonstrations of the technology. Any \u201ccost certainty\u201d would hinge on a successful demonstration and the company\u2019s ability to manufacture in-house, he said.\n\u201c[Cost certainty] has been very elusive in this space,\u201d he said.\nAerial view of the construction site of Linglong-1 (ACP-100), the world's first onshore commercial small modular reactor (SMR), on July 4, 2024, in Changjiang Li Autonomous County, Hainan Province of China.

While the upfront costs may be higher, reactors have a lifespan of 60 to 100 years, he said. With the smaller footprint, SMRs can also be built closer to data centers, minimizing infrastructure costs, he added.\nThe Department of Energy says nuclear energy is critical to transitioning the country away from fossil fuels. The agency has set aside $900 million in funding for the development of SMRs.\nThe Energy Department estimates the US will need approximately 700-900 GW of additional clean, firm power generation capacity to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, adding that nuclear energy already provides nearly half of carbon-free electricity in the country.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nIn a recent Tech Check program, CNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI\u2019s head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries. In the latest round of AI developments, an OpenAI spokesperson revealed that the company is reportedly planning to release its next frontier AI model, codenamed Orion, by December. This release is going to be in the form of a phased rollout, where it will gradually release the model to trusted partners before a broader rollout through ChatGPT. The upcoming frontier model release is quite crucial, considering that the company has recently raised $6.6 billion in funding at a $157 billion valuation. Moreover, investors anticipate more advanced models to maintain its leadership in the tech industry.\nRival Anthropic comes bearing their own set of breaking news. As reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide \u201cmathematically precise and reproducible answers\u201d by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThink of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data \u2014 cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result\u201d.\nDespite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly \u201challucinating\u201d. OpenAI may deem it to have near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy\u201d, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments. A University of Michigan researcher found hallucinations in 80% of the audio transcriptions he examined during a study of public meetings.\nSuch mistakes could have \u201creally grave consequences,\u201d particularly in hospital settings\u2026Nobody wants a misdiagnosis\u201d and that \u201cThere should be a higher bar.\u201d\nWith that, let's look at the 15 recent AI news that nobody should miss.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Tesla (TSLA) has work to do if it wants to remain among tech elites.\nDespite a surprising third quarter earnings report that sent the EV maker's stock surging \u2014 resulting in its biggest intraday jump in over a decade \u2014 Wall Street is once again reevaluating its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven.\nThe group\u2019s members \u2014 Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla \u2014 dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks \u2014 Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet.\nThe debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines.\nThat\u2019s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals.\nFreedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on \u201chopes and dreams\u201d than fundamentals.\n\u201cTesla had its moment in the sun \u2026 to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,\u201d Woods warned on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief.\nWhile CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm\u2019s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business \u2014 a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers.\n\u201cI've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen \u2026 We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,\u201d longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me.\nTesla\u2019s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group.\n\u2022 USD\n(TSLA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAs of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts.\nAs far as Tesla\u2019s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender.\nWealth Enhancement Group\u2019s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix \u201cmakes the most sense,\u201d as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance.\nStory Continues\nSince the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nPortfolio Wealth Advisors\u2019 Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a \u201ccash flow machine,\" and Netflix \u201cfits the bill.\u201d\n\u201cNetflix\u2019s free cash flow has been relentless \u2026 Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,\u201d Alvarado added.\nThe streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022.\nBank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix\u2019s growing free cash flow as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nAs of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock.\nWhile Tesla\u2019s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix\u2019s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.\nSeana's week ahead checklist\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Whether they can reverse that trend will go a long way to determining if the rally in equities can keep going.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nThe five biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index by market capitalization \u2014 Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. \u2014 are projected to post average earnings growth of 19% in their third-quarter results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. While that would handily top the S&P 500\u2019s projected 4.3% increase, it also would represent their slowest collective expansion in six quarters, BI data shows.\nWhat\u2019s more, the gap between Big Tech and the rest of the market is expected to continue to narrow into 2025, by which time last year\u2019s roughly 35% quarterly earnings growth will be a distant memory. So the question for investors is what this means for these stocks, all of which have soared through the market\u2019s latest rally, and whether they can continue leading indexes higher.\n\u201cSentiment is a lot shakier than in past quarters, and the factors driving the market now feel more negative,\u201d said Andrew Choi, portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments in San Francisco. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the rally is over, but there are opportunities elsewhere, especially as we have these debates about Big Tech valuations, slower earnings momentum, and every story now has some element of controversy or debate that\u2019s weighing on sentiment.\u201d\nMarket Rotates\nFor most of the past two years, the tech giants have led the S&P 500 higher, fueled by relentlessly expanding profits and investors willing to keep paying higher multiples for those earnings. That\u2019s changed in recent months, however.\nSince peaking on July 10 following a 22% rally to start the year, the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, which is comprised of the five S&P behemoths as well as Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc., has fallen 2%. That lags every major sector in the S&P 500, with the utilities, real estate, financial and industrial groups jumping more than 10% and the broader index gaining 3.1% over the same span.\nAll of which has put Big Tech companies in a position they\u2019re unaccustomed to: stock market underdogs. They\u2019re facing greater scrutiny with valuations elevated and questions about when their heavy spending on artificial intelligence initiatives will pay off.\nStory Continues\n\u201cTech ceding its market leadership position could last through the end of the year, but that doesn\u2019t scare us off from owning them long term,\u201d said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a risk that earnings growth is decelerating, and valuations may be a little stretched. But they still bring so much growth to the table And there\u2019s still significant upside to earnings potential over the coming years.\u201d\nWhile Tesla has already posted better than expected third-quarter profits and an encouraging outlook, Big Tech earnings season really kicks off in earnest this week. Google-owner Alphabet reports on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, and Apple and Amazon on Thursday. Nvidia isn\u2019t expected to give results until late November.\nAn AI Future\nAll of this week\u2019s reporters come with their own issues. Microsoft faces concerns about its prospects in AI. Apple has seen early signs of tepid demand for its newest iPhones, although long-term optimism helped send the stock to a record last week. Amazon investors are worried about heavy capital spending eating into profits. And Alphabet has regulatory uncertainty as the US Justice Department investigates it for monopoly practices.\nAI will be a big focus for investors watching the earnings reports, particularly how much the companies are spending on expensive infrastructure. In the third quarter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms are projected to have poured $56 billion into capital expenditures, up 52% from the same period a year ago.\nInvestors generally buy the premise that the companies\u2019 AI investments represent the future of technology. But there\u2019s also little evidence of an immediate burst of profitability for companies like Microsoft, which has integrated AI features into its software products. Disappointment over the disparity between AI spending and outcomes marred an otherwise strong second-quarter earnings season. Now, it\u2019s raising concerns about future profit margins.\n\u201cTop-line gains are starting to get offset by surging AI-related capital spending,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper wrote in a research note. \u201cThat implies peak margins are likely in the past, at least for the near term.\u201d\nBig Tech\u2019s recent underperformance has coincided with souring sentiment from the so-called smart money on Wall Street. Hedge funds have been selling Magnificent Seven stocks over the past several months, and despite modest buying in October net long positions as a percentage of total US exposure are still around the lowest level since mid-2023, according to data from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage desk.\nValuation Conundrum\nDespite the slump in megacap stock prices, many of these companies are carrying valuations that are higher than historical averages. Apple is trading at 32 times estimated profits over the next 12 months, compared with an average of 20 times over the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft is priced at 33 times, compared with an average of 25.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at tech, are earnings really going to grow enough to keep pace with these multiples, or does some of the recent strength reflect a fear of missing out?\u201d said Clark Bellin, chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss the impact of momentum, but at some point the music could stop, and people need to keep their expectations in check this earnings season.\u201d\nTo be sure, Wall Street pros remain overwhelmingly bullish on Big Tech. Roughly 90% of the analysts covering Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia have buy ratings on the stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figures are 83% for Alphabet and 65% for Apple, while the average S&P 500 company sits at about 53%.\nThe reason for the optimism is fairly simple. For all the concerns, they continue to offer above average profit growth, exposure to AI, strong capital returns and less risk than other stock market sectors, according to Parnassus\u2019s Choi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find dominant businesses with this kind of earnings growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to like.\u201d\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

After all, there's more to one's investing life than modeling out 2050 profits for Nvidia (NVDA) and wondering whether Tesla (TSLA) will haul in $10 billion in sales from humanoid robots.\nIn the spirit of this, here are a couple of convos I had this week that may leave you thinking (hopefully).\nAI meets extra spicy hot sauce: I was at a CEO dinner this week where an analyst specializing in AI proceeded to share the deep impact to businesses as AI proliferates. I tend to agree the way business is done will change profoundly, and it'll include a good bit of job loss.\nAn example of AI's impact is in Cholula hot sauce. Its parent, spice maker McCormick (MKC), held an investor day this week.\n\"We have used generative AI to really understand where all the commentary was going [for hot sauce], we learned there were some Cholula lovers out there that wanted a hotter version. So in January, we are launching an extra-hot version of Cholula,\" McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination Overtime.\nMcCormick reiterated its long-term sales growth guidance of 4% to 6% and earnings growth of 9% to 11%. Shares are up 16% year to date compared to the 22% gain for the S&P 500.\nYou can catch that full spicy segment here.\nBuilding a 21st-century media company: The traditional media industry continues to be disrupted by everything from new streaming networks to creators posting on YouTube. Why else do you think Disney (DIS) said this week its CEO Bob Iger was sticking around until 2026 (he was rumored to be leaving in 2025)? He has to leave the business in a much better place than his last exit.\nOne of these disrupters in the past 15 years has been Dude Perfect. The company was started by five friends who went to Texas A&M and rose to fame for viral trick-shot videos posted on YouTube. The company now boasts 60.5 million subscribers and churns out a steady, broader array of content.\nArmed with a new $100 million capital infusion from Highmount Capital, Dude Perfect is gearing up for more unique programming and the build-out of a headquarters in Frisco, Texas. In charge of bringing that vision to life? Dude Perfect's first-ever CEO Andrew Yaffe, who took the job several weeks ago.\nStory Continues\n\"I think people underestimate how big YouTube is,\" Yaffe told me of the Google-owned (GOOG) platform on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here). \"YouTube is the biggest media platform in the US in terms of consumption.

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nTesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company\u2019s quarterly results with a flurry of buying.\nA 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d counterparts \u2014 and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began.\nThat means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there\u2019s one chart that encompasses 2024\u2019s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out.\nFor example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic \u2014 significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week\u2019s gains.\nZooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla\u2019s membership in this informal \u2014 but important \u2014 cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year.\nPerhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark \u2014 who\u2019s above it and who\u2019s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors.\nNvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies \u2014 30% of the index \u2014 that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market\u2019s broadening and rotation.\nSince the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek\u2019s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven.\n\u201cIf one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cOur own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.\u201d\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

However, I feel it\u2019s too early to invest in IBM for quantum potential, especially given the stock\u2019s valuation. I\u2019m neutral on this rather expensive stock.\nExamining IBM\u2019s Growth Amid AI Excitement\nIBM, founded in 1911, is a multinational technology corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York. Its positioning in the information technology segment predates pretty much all of its big tech peers, showcasing decades of leadership in hardware and enterprise solutions.\nIn light of this history,\u00a0the company\u2019s stock has risen significantly over the past 12 months\u2014over 70% at the time of writing\u2014largely fueled by excitement around artificial intelligence (AI), as investors have ploughed into stocks with exposure or potential exposure to AI.\nHowever,\u00a0IBM\u2019s performance had broadly impressed investors until the Q3 results released on October 23. For example, IBM\u2019s recurring revenue, represented by an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of $14.1 billion, grew by 9% year-over-year in Q2, outpacing overall revenue growth of 4%. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s software segment saw an 8% increase in revenue to $6.7 billion, indicating potential for future growth as it becomes a larger part of overall sales.\nMoreover,\u00a0these prospects are compounded by the hybrid cloud market, which is expected to grow significantly, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.4% from 2025 to 2033.\u00a0Yet, despite these positive indicators,\u00a0IBM\u2019s stock surge appears more driven by AI hype than by substantial changes in its fundamental business performance.\nIs IBM\u2019s AI Hype Overstated?\nPersonally, I\u2019m concerned that IBM\u2019s exposure to AI might be overstated. While IBM has reported growth in its generative AI business, with a book of business reaching over $2 billion since the launch of watsonx, this figure is small compared to its total trailing twelve-month revenue of $62.36 billion. The company\u2019s AI-related revenues represent a fraction of its overall business.\nMoreover, revenue growth certainly isn\u2019t groundbreaking. The 9% ARR year-over-year growth in Q2 was followed by just 1% growth in total revenue in Q3. This suggests that IBM is not yet positioned as a true software-centric company that could justify a higher valuation based solely on AI capabilities.\nStory Continues\nHowever, that\u2019s not to say IBM\u2019s AI advancements, including Granite 3.0 and Red Hat OpenShift AI, won\u2019t contribute to future growth, particularly in the consulting business. These technologies enhance IBM\u2019s capability to offer sophisticated AI solutions tailored to enterprise needs. By integrating these advancements into its consulting services, IBM can better support clients\u2019 digital transformation efforts and potentially leverage additional growth.\nWill IMB Lead in Quantum Computing?\nOne area I\u2019m particularly interested in is quantum computing. Quantum computing promises to unlock vast computing potential due to something called superposition \u2014 the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at one time. In short, it means that vast calculations can be computed in almost no time at all. The problem is, the technology isn\u2019t quite there yet.\nIn this context, IBM is well-positioned to become a dominant player in the quantum computing industry, having invested billions in research. The company is actively involved in significant quantum research projects, such as the Fermilab-led initiative, which focuses on developing superconducting quantum systems.\nMoreover, the global quantum computing market is expected to grow significantly, with projections indicating an increase from $1.21 billion in 2023 to $12.62 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.8%. This rapid pace of growth presents opportunities for companies that can master the technology and deliver commercially viable solutions.\nOn the other hand, IBM faces competition from a growing ecosystem of quantum investors, including players like Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Additionally, smaller companies, such as IonQ, are investing heavily in producing early quantum solutions.\nDoes this Justify IBM\u2019s Expensive Valuation?\nI\u2019m concerned that IBM is expensive relative to its expected growth. The stock currently trades at 22.8x forward earnings, representing a 4.8% discount to the information technology sector as a whole. However, IBM\u2019s expected earnings growth is below the industry average, with a CAGR of just 5.2% compared to the industry average of 14.8%.\nCollectively, this results in a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 4.43. Even when we account for the forward dividend yield of 2.9%, the stock still appears expensive. As such, IBM seems priced according to unrealized potential, whether in AI or quantum computing. Personally, I think this makes it a risky bet.\nIs IBM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nOn TipRanks, IBM comes in as a Hold based on five Buys, seven Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The\u00a0average IBM stock price target\u00a0is $227.38, implying an upside potential of 4%.\nSee more IBM analyst ratings\nThe Bottom Line on IBM Stock\nOn paper, IBM doesn\u2019t look like a great value. The company trades above its share price target, and its PEG ratio is quite off-putting, even when dividends are taken into account. There\u2019s, of course, potential in the highly exciting AI and quantum computing segments. However, I\u2019d argue that the price tag is currently too high to take the plunge and invest.\nView Comments"

SMRs are designed to produce cheaper, faster, greener energy than traditional nuclear facilities.\n\u2022 USD\n(OKLO)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAmazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) in mid-October announced substantial investments in SMR projects as they look to balance their climate goals with the growing energy demands of the data centers powering their various AI software. Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison announced in September that the company intends to build a data center powered by SMRs.\n\u201cA nuclear power renaissance is underway with nuclear increasingly viewed as a solution which solves both the increased need for baseload power and the need to decarbonize,\u201d wrote Craig-Hallum analyst Eric Stine in a recent note to investors. Baseload power refers to the day-to-day energy demand on an electrical grid.\nStine said Google and Amazon\u2019s investments are \u201ctruly just the beginning of a multi-decade megatrend.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs estimates that global data center power consumption will grow 160% by 2030, driven by demand from artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, separate data from the International Atomic Energy Agency shows nuclear power production in North America potentially doubling by 2050.\nStocks of other firms making similar tech to Oklo\u2019s, such as NuScale (SM\u0192R) and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE), also surged following news of Google's and Amazon's investments on Oct. 14 and Oct. 16, respectively, before paring gains this week.\n\u2022 USD\n(NNE)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n\u201cThe opportunity is so massive here in the market that there's going to be a good number of folks that are successful,\u201d Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte told Yahoo Finance.\nIn fact, the SMR market could grow to $300 billion by 2040, according to research cited by Citi analysts.\nToo many 'ifs'\nOklo went public in May through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, AltC Acquisition Corp., which Altman co-founded. In addition to Altman, Cathie Wood and Peter Thiel are on its list of investors.\nSam Altman owned a 2.6% stake in the company, according to a regulatory filing in June. He became chair of Oklo in 2024 after serving as its CEO for three years.\nSam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI as well as chairman of Oklo, speaks during the Italian Tech Week 2024. (Stefano Guidi/Getty Images) \u00b7 Stefano Guidi via Getty Images\nWhile Oklo was founded in 2013, well ahead of the AI boom, the energy needs of artificial intelligence have been a boon to the firm as it builds its client book, DeWitte said.\nStory Continues\n\u201cAI does make [up] the bulk of our order book that we've talked about,\u201d DeWitte said in an interview. That includes clients in the chip sector as well as data centers, he added. Publicly, the company has said it's working with hyperscalers Equinix and Prometheus Hyperscale. It has yet to disclose any deals with Big Tech firms.\nBut Wall Street analysts caution that the company and its competitors face regulatory and supply chain hurdles before they can produce anywhere near the amount of power needed to run artificial intelligence data centers.\nNuclear projects have been subject to stringent regulations in response to high-profile global nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011. On average, it takes the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission 80 months to approve nuclear plant construction in the US, compared to an average of 54 months in the UK, according to research cited by Canaccord Genuity.\nWhile a number of companies are developing SMRs \u2014 including Bill Gates\u2019 TerraPower \u2014 none have been deployed in the US to date, and long licensing processes mean profitability isn't exactly on the horizon.\nIn Oklo\u2019s first earnings report since going public on Aug. 13, the company reported a net loss of about $53 million for the first six months of the year, wider than the roughly $9 million loss it posted in the year-earlier period.\nMockup of Oklo\u2019s Aurora powerhouse. (Courtesy of Oklo, Illustration by Gensler) \u00b7 (Gensler)\nFuel is also an issue for companies in the space: Many SMRs, such as those of Oklo, NuScale, and TerraPower, require a specific type called high-assay low-enriched uranium, also known as HALEU, which is imported from Russia. There's little to no domestic supply since the West at large has avoided developing a HALEU supply chain. That's because enriched uranium is used in nuclear weapons, according to Canaccord Genuity.\n\u201cA developed Western HALEU supply chain is absent, particularly given efforts to limit enrichment due to concerns over proliferation,\u201d wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas in a note to investors early this year.\nCiting supply constraints and long and difficult licensing processes, Citi\u2019s Vikram Bagri recently reduced his price target on Oklo stock from $11 to $10.\n\u201cThere are too many \u2018ifs\u2019 in this process,\u201d Bagri said. \u201cThe new technology and new nuclear installs, it seems like, will happen only after 2030. After 2030, it remains to be seen who gets successful and how successful they get, how many nuclear reactors we see.\u201d\nBut Seaport analyst Jeffrey Campbell sees Oklo having advantages in the burgeoning market, pointing to its ability to use \u201cmuch cheaper\u201d recycled fuel.\nWhereas a traditional nuclear plant can take billions of dollars to build, Oklo has said the cost of bringing one of its SMRs online is a few hundred million dollars.\nFor his part, DeWitte is optimistic about the future of the market \u2014 and Oklo\u2019s place in it. DeWitte cited mounting bipartisan support to reduce regulatory hurdles and enhance the domestic supply of HALEU. He said Oklo is unique because the company is looking to own and operate its facilities and sell energy directly to customers, rather than the traditional model of licensing its technology to utilities. DeWitte believes this will enable the company to bring its reactors online faster.\nOklo CEO Jacob DeWitte, joined by Lynn Martin, NYSE group president, rings the Opening Bell after Oklo IPO.

          "whole_article": "US companies already dominate the global stock market when it comes to size. A new chart from JPMorgan Asset Management shows that's largely expected to continue. The firm attributes the boom to artificial intelligence.\nIn JPM's 2025 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions released on Monday, the team projected that US companies' market cap share of the total global equity market will fall from 64% currently to 60% in 2037. Still, as seen in the chart below, the US (in green) would maintain a large lead over the estimated second-largest share of the global equity market, China (in red).\nJPMorgan Asset Management's global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions Monica Issar told Yahoo Finance during a media roundtable on Monday that the US will continue to lead by market cap share as artificial intelligence benefits expand beyond a few large tech names that have dominated the market rally over the past year to companies in various industries.\nIssar gave two reasons for the prediction: revenue production and margin improvement. The first will come from the money pouring into AI benefiting companies outside of Big Tech. This plays out as tech companies buy AI chips from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), and, as they need more power, these AI operators are forced to spend with companies in the Utilities (XLU) and Energy (XLE) sectors.\nAs AI makes companies more efficient and eliminates the most simple work, eventually cutting down costs, US corporates should get a boost to profit margins.\n\"It's going to be the US predominantly, and then obviously Europe will follow, because you're starting to see some adoption there,\" Issar said.\nTo put the current US dominance in perspective, just Nvidia's (NVDA) market cap alone is larger than most other G7 countries, Apollo chief global economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k wrote in a research note on Thursday. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nTo be sure, Sl\u00f8k noted that this could be a risk to the market overall.\n\"Global equity markets, including retirement allocations to equities, are basically leveraged to Nvidia,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote. \"Let\u2019s hope the value of Nvidia doesn\u2019t decline significantly.\"\nOthers have a more sanguine view of the AI superpower's dominance, though. In a recent research note detailing why the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could average more than 10% annual returns over the next decade, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed to the US being at the forefront of AI adoption and well positioned to dominate amid the technology's \"global adoption.\"\nStory Continues\nColas wrote the odds that a non-US tech company will rise over the next decade and unseat the large tech companies currently driving the US market share like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are \"almost zero.\"\n\"The US continues to dominate global venture capital,\" Colas wrote. \"If a new US business does eventually threaten their preeminence, then it will certainly go public, be in the S&P 500, and drive future returns.\"\nThe national flag is installed for a campaign rally of former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outside of Christ Chapel in Zebulon, Georgia, on Oct. 23, 2024.

Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries. In the latest round of AI developments, an OpenAI spokesperson revealed that the company is reportedly planning to release its next frontier AI model, codenamed Orion, by December. This release is going to be in the form of a phased rollout, where it will gradually release the model to trusted partners before a broader rollout through ChatGPT. The upcoming frontier model release is quite crucial, considering that the company has recently raised $6.6 billion in funding at a $157 billion valuation. Moreover, investors anticipate more advanced models to maintain its leadership in the tech industry.\nRival Anthropic comes bearing their own set of breaking news. As reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide \u201cmathematically precise and reproducible answers\u201d by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThink of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data \u2014 cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result\u201d. -Anthropic\nDespite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly \u201challucinating\u201d. OpenAI may deem it to have near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy\u201d, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nView our latest analysis for Microsoft\nIs Microsoft Fairly Valued?\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$76.3b\nUS$90.0b\nUS$115.1b\nUS$136.5b\nUS$165.7b\nUS$187.6b\nUS$206.3b\nUS$222.3b\nUS$236.0b\nUS$248.0b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x24\nAnalyst x21\nAnalyst x10\nAnalyst x7\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 13.21%\nEst @ 10.00%\nEst @ 7.75%\nEst @ 6.17%\nEst @ 5.07%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7%\nUS$71.5k\nUS$79.0k\nUS$94.7k\nUS$105.2k\nUS$119.6k\nUS$126.9k\nUS$130.8k\nUS$132.0k\nUS$131.3k\nUS$129.3k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.1t\nStory Continues\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$248b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (6.7%\u2013 2.5%) = US$6.0t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$6.0t\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$3.1t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.3t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$428, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\ndcf\nThe Assumptions\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.027. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for Microsoft\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nLooking Ahead:\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Whether they can reverse that trend will go a long way to determining if the rally in equities can keep going.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nThe five biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index by market capitalization \u2014 Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. \u2014 are projected to post average earnings growth of 19% in their third-quarter results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. While that would handily top the S&P 500\u2019s projected 4.3% increase, it also would represent their slowest collective expansion in six quarters, BI data shows.\nWhat\u2019s more, the gap between Big Tech and the rest of the market is expected to continue to narrow into 2025, by which time last year\u2019s roughly 35% quarterly earnings growth will be a distant memory. So the question for investors is what this means for these stocks, all of which have soared through the market\u2019s latest rally, and whether they can continue leading indexes higher.\n\u201cSentiment is a lot shakier than in past quarters, and the factors driving the market now feel more negative,\u201d said Andrew Choi, portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments in San Francisco. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the rally is over, but there are opportunities elsewhere, especially as we have these debates about Big Tech valuations, slower earnings momentum, and every story now has some element of controversy or debate that\u2019s weighing on sentiment.\u201d\nMarket Rotates\nFor most of the past two years, the tech giants have led the S&P 500 higher, fueled by relentlessly expanding profits and investors willing to keep paying higher multiples for those earnings. That\u2019s changed in recent months, however.\nSince peaking on July 10 following a 22% rally to start the year, the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, which is comprised of the five S&P behemoths as well as Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc., has fallen 2%. That lags every major sector in the S&P 500, with the utilities, real estate, financial and industrial groups jumping more than 10% and the broader index gaining 3.1% over the same span.\nAll of which has put Big Tech companies in a position they\u2019re unaccustomed to: stock market underdogs. They\u2019re facing greater scrutiny with valuations elevated and questions about when their heavy spending on artificial intelligence initiatives will pay off.\nStory Continues\n\u201cTech ceding its market leadership position could last through the end of the year, but that doesn\u2019t scare us off from owning them long term,\u201d said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a risk that earnings growth is decelerating, and valuations may be a little stretched. But they still bring so much growth to the table And there\u2019s still significant upside to earnings potential over the coming years.\u201d\nWhile Tesla has already posted better than expected third-quarter profits and an encouraging outlook, Big Tech earnings season really kicks off in earnest this week. Google-owner Alphabet reports on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, and Apple and Amazon on Thursday. Nvidia isn\u2019t expected to give results until late November.\nAn AI Future\nAll of this week\u2019s reporters come with their own issues. Microsoft faces concerns about its prospects in AI. Apple has seen early signs of tepid demand for its newest iPhones, although long-term optimism helped send the stock to a record last week. Amazon investors are worried about heavy capital spending eating into profits. And Alphabet has regulatory uncertainty as the US Justice Department investigates it for monopoly practices.\nAI will be a big focus for investors watching the earnings reports, particularly how much the companies are spending on expensive infrastructure. In the third quarter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms are projected to have poured $56 billion into capital expenditures, up 52% from the same period a year ago.\nInvestors generally buy the premise that the companies\u2019 AI investments represent the future of technology. But there\u2019s also little evidence of an immediate burst of profitability for companies like Microsoft, which has integrated AI features into its software products. Disappointment over the disparity between AI spending and outcomes marred an otherwise strong second-quarter earnings season. Now, it\u2019s raising concerns about future profit margins.\n\u201cTop-line gains are starting to get offset by surging AI-related capital spending,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper wrote in a research note. \u201cThat implies peak margins are likely in the past, at least for the near term.\u201d\nBig Tech\u2019s recent underperformance has coincided with souring sentiment from the so-called smart money on Wall Street. Hedge funds have been selling Magnificent Seven stocks over the past several months, and despite modest buying in October net long positions as a percentage of total US exposure are still around the lowest level since mid-2023, according to data from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage desk.\nValuation Conundrum\nDespite the slump in megacap stock prices, many of these companies are carrying valuations that are higher than historical averages. Apple is trading at 32 times estimated profits over the next 12 months, compared with an average of 20 times over the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft is priced at 33 times, compared with an average of 25.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at tech, are earnings really going to grow enough to keep pace with these multiples, or does some of the recent strength reflect a fear of missing out?\u201d said Clark Bellin, chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss the impact of momentum, but at some point the music could stop, and people need to keep their expectations in check this earnings season.\u201d\nTo be sure, Wall Street pros remain overwhelmingly bullish on Big Tech. Roughly 90% of the analysts covering Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia have buy ratings on the stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figures are 83% for Alphabet and 65% for Apple, while the average S&P 500 company sits at about 53%.\nThe reason for the optimism is fairly simple. For all the concerns, they continue to offer above average profit growth, exposure to AI, strong capital returns and less risk than other stock market sectors, according to Parnassus\u2019s Choi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find dominant businesses with this kind of earnings growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to like.\u201d\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

While the Index has gained 13% year to date, it has lagged the S&P 500, up by 21% over the same period.\nThe significant underperformance is because the Dow is mostly made up of blue-chip American companies, most of which have come under pressure amid deteriorating macroeconomics. While the Index is mostly made up of financial services companies at 23%, followed by technology at 20%, it has felt the full brunt of\u00a0 deteriorating economic conditions.\nREAD ALSO: 8 Worst Performing Tech Stocks in 2024 and 10 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2024.\nThe U.S. economy is reeling from the effects of high interest rates, resulting in a slowdown in the labour market, and the manufacturing sector has significantly affected the Dow holdings. Additionally, the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have rattled investors' sentiments, resulting in most of them shunning equities in favor of safe havens like bonds and treasuries.\nThe uncertainty around the upcoming U.S. presidential election has only exacerbated the situation, with investors shunning stocks that would be affected mainly by a change of policies once there is a leadership change at the White House.\u00a0 According to analysts at Bank of America, who ends up in the White House and Congress could have a significant impact on critical corners of the stock market.\n\u201cProfits accelerating are far more important than who is sitting in the Oval Office. But politics can make or break sub-sectors,\u201d the firm wrote in a research note to investors.\nAmid the headwinds, the overall equity market has been trading higher, with major indices led by the Dow and the S&P 500 rallying to record highs. The strong gains have come on most companies delivering solid financial results and shrugging off the effects of high interest rates. Nevertheless the rallies have resulted in overstretched valuations, raising serious concerns for the investment community.\n\u201cThe market had moved into overbought territory, making it vulnerable to anything it perceives as negative \u2026 It\u2019s now worried that the Fed has not declared victory on inflation, and not to mention, the concerns post-election,\u201d said LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Krosby.\nStory Continues\nA resilient U.S. economy that has steered clear of recession has helped support most stocks in the Dow, helping fuel the upward momentum. The International Monetary Fund thinks growth in the U.S. will remain robust. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF increased its estimate for U.S. GDP in 2024 to 2.8% from its 2.6% forecast in July while raising its 2025 growth forecast for the country. It\u2019s the only advanced economy with its economic trajectory revised upwards for both years by the IMF. Nevertheless, it has warned of slowdowns in emerging markets.\n\u201cProjected slowdowns in the largest emerging market and developing economies imply a longer path to close the income gaps between poor and rich countries. Having growth stuck in low gear could also further exacerbate income inequality within economies,\u201d the IMF warned.\nWith the U.S. economy expected to remain resilient as the Federal Reserve pushes forth with interest rate cuts, Dow stocks that have underperformed are well poised to bounce back. A lower interest rate environment on the back of improved economic conditions heading into year-end would make the case for the best Dow stocks to buy, according to analysts.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts, we started by analyzing the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We screened these stocks based on average price targets, focusing on stocks with significant upside potential. Finally, we ranked these companies in ascending order based on their price target upside as of October 23. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nAverage Upside Potential as of October 23: 17.75%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has emerged as the biggest winner amid the artificial intelligence race owing to its multibillion-dollar investments in OpenAI and other generative A.I. innovations. Nevertheless, the company boasts a robust business empire spanning software, cloud computing, gaming, and devices, which is why it is one of the best Dow stocks to buy, according to analysts.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure cloud computing division has benefited most from A.I., as businesses use its platform to develop their own A.I. solutions. Similarly, as evidenced by revenue growth of between 29% and 30% over the last few quarters, the unit is becoming a major contributor to underlying growth. The business is looking at A.I. to support growth in areas other than cloud computing.\u00a0 Search is one area benefiting from Microsoft A.I. investments following the integration into Bing search to better compete against Google.\nAnother significant success story for A.I. is its GitHub Developer platform, where users have resorted to Copilot. This AI assistant can offer suggestions while developers type and even finish coding tasks. \u00a0 Additionally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pursuing growth in gaming following its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which provides another avenue for generating revenues and long-term value.\nWhile the stock trades at a 10.5% premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 35.5, it is expected of a company with tremendous opportunities for growth. The stock rewards investors with a 0.79% Dividend yield for generating passive income. Likewise, Wall Street analysts rate it as a buy with an average price target of $503.38, implying a 17.75% upside potential.\nAdditionally, Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 data reveals that 279 hedge funds have invested in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), making it one of the most popular stocks among hedge funds at the moment.\nOverall MSFT ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries. In the latest round of AI developments, an OpenAI spokesperson revealed that the company is reportedly planning to release its next frontier AI model, codenamed Orion, by December. This release is going to be in the form of a phased rollout, where it will gradually release the model to trusted partners before a broader rollout through ChatGPT. The upcoming frontier model release is quite crucial, considering that the company has recently raised $6.6 billion in funding at a $157 billion valuation. Moreover, investors anticipate more advanced models to maintain its leadership in the tech industry.\nRival Anthropic comes bearing their own set of breaking news. As reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide \u201cmathematically precise and reproducible answers\u201d by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThink of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data \u2014 cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result\u201d.\nDespite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly \u201challucinating\u201d. OpenAI may deem it to have near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy\u201d, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments. A University of Michigan researcher found hallucinations in 80% of the audio transcriptions he examined during a study of public meetings.\nSuch mistakes could have \u201creally grave consequences,\u201d particularly in hospital settings\u2026Nobody wants a misdiagnosis\u201d and that \u201cThere should be a higher bar.\u201d\nWith that, let's look at the 15 recent AI news that nobody should miss.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Generative AI has arguably been the biggest trend, with McKinsey estimating that it could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries annually, based on 63 use cases they analyzed. Back in 2022, when OpenAI launched its free web app, ChatGPT, few could have predicted the scale of the AI revolution that would follow. Major tech giants have since followed suit, revealing their own chatbot-based assistants, AI-enabled phones, and much more.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and\u00a020 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\nAs AI continues to revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries to new heights, today\u2019s headlines reveal just how impactful these advancements can be. The question of the hour is, with all of these big AI breakthroughs, are regulators finally catching up with developers working on their next big AI projects? Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

It was for identity threat protection software intended for the US Internal Revenue Service, according to documents from both companies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nBut the IRS never bought the software, according to records reviewed by Bloomberg News and people with knowledge of the situation.\nStill, Carahsoft has been making on-time payments on the $32 million to CrowdStrike, according to the cybersecurity firm. When asked for comment by Bloomberg News, both companies explained that they had a \u201cnon-cancellable order\u201d between them. They declined to say why that deal was struck without a purchase in place from the IRS. Shares of CrowdStrike fell as much as 2.7% after Bloomberg News reported about the deal.\nSome legal and accounting experts, who reviewed the arrangement at Bloomberg\u2019s request, said it raises red flags that merit scrutiny from regulators. The deal also raised concerns within CrowdStrike \u2014 according to people familiar with the matter and the company itself \u2013 and many specifics of the transaction remain unclear.\nDepending on how CrowdStrike accounted for the deal in financial statements \u2014 the company didn\u2019t explain those details \u2014 it was big enough that it could have made the difference between the company beating or missing Wall Street projections for the period. The day after CrowdStrike reported results for the record quarter, its shares rose 10%.\nJeremy Fielding, a spokesperson representing CrowdStrike, dismissed employees\u2019 concerns as baseless and the order\u2019s timing as insignificant. The Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm closes deals \u201cthroughout the quarter, starting the first day and often through the last day,\" he said.\nStory Continues\n\"The Carahsoft deal went through a separate and extensive review,\" he said, adding that it \"was given a clean bill of health.\" Fielding characterized the experts\u2019 comments as \u201cinaccurately speculating about a transaction that CrowdStrike confirmed fully met\u201d an accounting standard on revenue from contracts. CrowdStrike \u201cclosed and recognized\u201d the deal once Carahsoft placed the order, and its booking of the revenue is consistent with standard accounting principles, according to Thomas Clare and Elizabeth Locke, lawyers representing the cybersecurity company.\nA representative of Carahsoft, Mary Lange, said in an email, \u201cCarahsoft is a private company and we do not disclose financial information or customer details. That said, we placed a valid, non-cancellable order with CrowdStrike and stand by that transaction.\u201d The company declined to answer any other questions.\nThe IRS didn\u2019t answer detailed questions. The tax agency said in a statement that it doesn\u2019t hold any contracts with CrowdStrike directly and, in keeping with federal procurement rules, acquires its software and services through third-party vendors.\nNo IRS contract or payments matching the deal appear in the public government spending database USASPENDING.gov. The database excludes some information \u2014 for instance, material that could compromise national security. But the tax agency\u2019s purchases of CrowdStrike\u2019s products through vendors total less than $10 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.This story is based on records of the transaction and interviews with five people familiar with the matter, who requested that their names not be published because they aren\u2019t authorized to discuss it.\n\u201cIt raises an eyebrow,\u201d said Lawrence Cunningham, director of the University of Delaware\u2019s John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance.\n\u201cIt appears on its face to be uncompensated risk, and rational businesses don\u2019t usually accept uncompensated risk,\u201d Cunningham said, referring to Carahsoft\u2019s payments to CrowdStrike.\nCarahsoft declined to answer questions about whether it was taking a loss on the deal or if it found a way to recoup the money.\nIn recent months, separate issues at CrowdStrike and Carahsoft have drawn negative attention and government scrutiny.\nCrowdStrike, with annual revenues of more than $3 billion, sells security software to thousands of businesses and government agencies globally. But in July, a flawed update from the firm knocked out millions of Windows computers around the world, disrupting air travel, medical care, banks and other businesses. Executives have apologized repeatedly, including before members of Congress; the company\u2019s share price plummeted after the outage and hasn\u2019t fully recovered.\nCarahsoft is a dominant player among resellers and distributors that help technology companies navigate the complexities of selling to government agencies. In September, agents from the FBI and the US Department of Defense searched the company\u2019s Reston, Virginia, headquarters. Lange, the Carahsoft spokesperson, previously said the company was cooperating with the FBI probe and that it involved \u201can investigation into a company with which Carahsoft has done business in the past.\u201d The Justice Department is also conducting a civil probe of Carahsoft and software giant SAP SE for potential price fixing on government contracts. The German firm is cooperating with the civil probe, a spokesperson said. SAP Chief Financial Officer Dominik Asam told Bloomberg News that SAP had \u201cgotten written assurance from Carahsoft\u201d that the FBI search was \u201centirely unrelated\u201d to SAP and a US subsidiary.\nThere\u2019s no known link between CrowdStrike and either the civil investigation or search of Carahsoft\u2019s office. Fielding, the CrowdStrike representative, said neither investigation is connected to the cybersecurity company.A potential deal for the IRS dates to early 2023, when CrowdStrike sales representatives began talking with agency officials about buying an identity verification tool to help prevent fraud in a new program that lets people file their taxes directly with the government, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nWork continued on a potential deal in the following months, but by mid-October it had become clear to at least some CrowdStrike staff that the IRS wouldn\u2019t order the software before the company\u2019s quarter closed at the end of the month, the people said.\nNevertheless, on Halloween, Carahsoft ordered $32.25 million worth of subscription access to CrowdStrike\u2019s \u201cGovernment National Identity Threat Protection\u201d service for as many as 40 million users, according to records and two of the people. The order split the purchase into four $8 million payments, with the final payment due at the end of this October. The order indicates that Carahsoft should be billed for the CrowdStrike software and that it should be shipped to the IRS\u2019s Washington headquarters.\nThat day, CrowdStrike sent an automated email to dozens of staff, saying, \u201cOpportunity has been Closed Won for Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\u201d\nThe closing of the deal and Kurtz referring to it on the earnings call alarmed some staff who raised internal concerns that CrowdStrike was \u201cpre-booking\u201d a transaction that they viewed as incomplete because it was unclear whether the IRS would ever make the large purchase, according to three of the people. US regulators have in some cases sued and fined companies over alleged pre-booking, also known as channel stuffing, claiming they misled investors by improperly recognizing revenue to inflate their financial figures.\nFielding said it was \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d that there was any pre-booking.\nThat quarter, $32 million was enough to make the difference between CrowdStrike beating analysts\u2019 expectations on two key financial metrics \u2014 annual recurring revenue and net new annual recurring revenue \u2014 or falling short of them. CrowdStrike highlighted both metrics in the earnings announcement for the quarter, but the company declined to answer questions about whether the deal was recorded under them.\nAnnual recurring revenue is widely used by software companies to track income from subscriptions. CrowdStrike has consistently emphasized it with investors, writing in a 2019 regulatory filing that it \u201cis a key metric to measure our business.\u201d\nTheresa Gabaldon, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, said that for CrowdStrike to appropriately book the deal as revenue it would need to have not only received payment but also delivered the product. Neither CrowdStrike nor Carahsoft answered questions about what became of the subscription software.\n\u201cI characterize it as raising red flags,\u201d Gabaldon, who teaches securities regulation, law and accounting, said of the deal.\nWhatever happened, Carahsoft was among the companies that CrowdStrike feted at a June \u201cpartner symposium.\u201d There, Kurtz and other CrowdStrike staff mingled with guests at a luxury resort on the southern California coast. A video shows attendees enjoying drinks and live string music on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean and getting sushi-making lessons from a celebrity chef.\nAt the event, CrowdStrike named Carahsoft \u201cDistributor of the Year.\u201d\n--With assistance from Charles Gorrivan.\n(Updates with CrowdStrike share drop in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

In this article, I will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to explain why, despite my bullish stance on both stocks, I believe Mastercard has a slight advantage heading into earnings day, making it the better buy.\nVisa\u2019s Fiscal Q3 Recap\nDespite Visa\u2019s underwhelming Q3 results reported in July, my long-term bullish thesis remains intact, even though the report raised some cautionary flags. Visa delivered an EPS of $2.42, which met estimates. However, the company reported revenue of $8.9 billion, slightly missing analysts\u2019 expectations of $8.924 billion. Still, this figure represents a 9.6% increase from the $8.12 billion reported a year earlier.\nGrowth was fueled by an increase in cards in circulation, rising from 4.1 billion to 4.5 billion, which boosted transactions and transaction volume. Visa processed 59.32 billion transactions during Q3, a 9.8% increase from 54.03 billion in the same period last year, resulting in a payments volume of $3.78 trillion for the quarter.\nDespite initial market pessimism following Visa\u2019s Q3 earnings call, the stock has risen by around 12% since then. This performance came despite three Wall Street analysts lowering their price targets, offset by one upgrade and two price target increases.\nHow Fiscal Q4 Is Shaping Up for Visa\nOne of my concerns about adopting an ultra-bullish stance ahead of Visa\u2019s earnings is the potential for Q4 to be weaker than anticipated. In its earnings call, Visa\u2019s management indicated that the outlook for upcoming quarters, including Q4, could be slightly softer due to external factors such as a hurricane affecting parts of Texas, a cyber outage from CrowdStrike (CRWD), and various macroeconomic pressures.\nManagement also stated that Q4 non-GAAP revenue should grow at a low double-digit rate, with a 10% growth translating to approximately $9.47 billion. Wall Street\u2019s consensus is slightly higher at $9.48 billion, reflecting 10.25% growth, despite 19 of 21 analysts revising estimates downward in the past three months. For EPS, Visa guided for high single-digit growth, with analysts expecting $2.58, implying 10.8% annual growth.\nBeyond topping analyst\u2019s expectations, a key focus for Visa\u2019s upcoming earnings will be its progress in \u201cvalue-added services\u201d (VAS), a significant growth driver. In Q3, Visa generated $2.2 billion from VAS, a 23% increase, positioning the company to exceed $8 billion in VAS revenue this year. This reflects Visa\u2019s efforts to diversify its revenue streams beyond traditional swipe fees and progress in this area is likely to positively influence the stock price\u2019s reaction.\nStory Continues\nIs V a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\nLooking at Wall Street consensus, 23 out of 28 bullish analysts rate Visa Stock a Strong Buy, with an\u00a0average price target of $314.09 implying a potential upside of 10.29%.\nSee more V stock analyst ratings\nMastercard\u2019s Q2 Recap\nShifting focus to Mastercard, the second-largest credit card company globally, I hold a slightly more bullish stance on the stock ahead of its earnings. Mastercard has performed well in 2024, with shares up 21%. The company\u2019s recent quarters indicate that it is benefiting from a resilient global economic environment, which is driving steady earnings growth.\nIn Q2, Mastercard reported revenues of $7 billion, marking an 11% year-over-year increase, which exceeded the $6.85 billion consensus. The company also posted adjusted diluted EPS of $3.59, a 24% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of $3.51. However, the most notable shortcoming in the report was purchase volume, which totaled $1.97 trillion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $2.01 trillion.\nWhat likely fueled the 17% rally in Mastercard\u2019s shares after its Q2 results was CEO Michael Miebach\u2019s statement that double-digit top and bottom-line growth was driven by \u201ccontinued healthy consumer spending.\u201d This was in contrast to Visa\u2019s management, which highlighted a slight moderation in spending within the lower consumer segment in the U.S. Consequently, seven Wall Street firms raised their target prices for Mastercard, with only one reducing their estimate.\nHow Q3 Is Shaping Up for Mastercard\nWhile I\u2019m leaning more bullish on Mastercard ahead of its earnings, it\u2019s important to note that growth expectations for the September quarter are quite similar to Visa\u2019s. Mastercard\u2019s Q3 guidance anticipates low double-digit growth in non-GAAP revenues, with Wall Street projecting $7.26 billion\u2014an 11.2% year-over-year increase. The company also expects operating expenses to rise by low double digits, aligning with consensus estimates of Q3 EPS at $3.74, reflecting a 10.5% year-over-year increase.\nAlthough the bar for top-line estimates is relatively high, with 17 out of 19 analysts raising their projections in the last three months, I believe there is minimal risk of Mastercard missing revenue expectations\u2014something it hasn\u2019t done since Q3 2020\u2014unlike Visa, which missed last quarter.\nMoreover, the recent Fed rate cut has likely supported both Mastercard and Visa shares by boosting card usage activity, which may be better reflected in Q3 results. Another significant factor that could drive Mastercard\u2019s stock higher is its international performance, with gross dollar volume (GDV) growing 9% year-over-year in Q2, compared to 6% growth in the U.S. This outpaced Visa\u2019s 5% growth in both the U.S. and internationally, potentially explaining Mastercard\u2019s outperformance relative to Visa throughout the year.\nIs MA a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\nThe Wall Street consensus on Mastercard is highly favorable, with 22 out of 26 analysts recommending a Buy, giving it a Strong Buy rating. The average price target of $537.54 implies a potential upside of 4.78%.\nSee more MA analyst ratings\nKey Takeaway\nWhile I have a long-term bullish outlook for both Visa and Mastercard, if I had to choose one as the better buy ahead of its earnings, I would lean toward Mastercard. Although this is a close call, I believe Mastercard has a stronger chance of exceeding estimates, given its recent earnings performance and the more confident narrative from its management regarding growth expectations amid macroeconomic challenges and on the international front.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\"\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.

The CrowdStrike and Fortinet partnership provides rich telemetry across endpoint and network, enabling fast and accurate AI-powered threat protection and response, while streamlining security operations with a single, unified view.\nThe Falcon platform revolutionized cybersecurity through an AI-native and adversary intelligence approach. Replacing antivirus and a host of other legacy point products has led to the market adopting the Falcon platform as the industry standard for endpoint security among other modules. Tested in multiple third-party assessments, the Falcon platform delivers industry-leading protection efficacy, enterprise scalability and deployment ease.\nFortinet\u2019s FortiGate NGFWs are available in multiple form factors, including hardware, software and as-a-Service. Fortinet\u2019s hardware utilizes proprietary purpose-built ASICs, yielding on average 17x faster firewall performance and are up to 90 percent more power efficient than the competition. The addition of Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard AI-powered Security Services offers organizations the highest threat-protection performance on the market today.\nThe seamless, bidirectional integration of CrowdStrike and Fortinet optimizes network and endpoint security, streamlines operations and accelerates detection and response to elusive threats across the entire enterprise environment.

          "whole_article": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Broadcom is:\n8.4% = US$5.5b \u00f7 US$66b (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2024).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.\nDoes Broadcom Have A Good Return On Equity?\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Broadcom has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Semiconductor industry classification.\nroe\nUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Broadcom visit our risks dashboard for free.\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\nBroadcom's Debt And Its 8.4% ROE\nBroadcom clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.06. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\nStory Continues\nSummary\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\nOf course Broadcom may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, emphasized the ongoing significance of fossil fuels in supporting technological advancements, even as investments in renewable energy continue to increase. He stated:\n\u201cThis is not just a grudge match between the old and the new, a battle of electric vehicles versus internal combustion. The truth is, fossil fuels are essential for a lot more than vehicles, like it or not.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Stock Picks\nCramer highlighted the growing energy demands of major tech companies, noting that the data centers they are constructing consume vast amounts of electricity. While these tech giants are making substantial investments in nuclear energy, he pointed out that this power source is unlikely to significantly impact data centers for at least another decade due to the complexities of building nuclear facilities and community resistance to having them nearby.\n\u201cIf we need more energy, we\u2019re going to get it from what comes out of the ground \u2026 fossil fuels that will power the data center, specifically natural gas\u2026 You may be reluctant to invest in it, you might think who cares, but you need to know how vital all of this fossil fuel technology is to the growth of the Magnificent Seven.\u201d\nCramer also reflected on the shift in the U.S. energy landscape, recalling how the nation was once heavily reliant on OPEC for oil imports just two decades ago. Today, he pointed out, the U.S. produces over 13 million barrels per day, making it the largest oil producer globally and a net exporter. He mentioned the Permian Basin's unexpected resilience, continually producing despite earlier predictions of depletion.\nCramer noted that the decline of OPEC has transformed the geopolitical landscape. He referenced the 1973 oil crisis, triggered by OPEC's retaliation against U.S. support for Israel, which led to stagflation and economic turmoil. In contrast, he pointed out that despite Israel's current conflict, the U.S. economy is not experiencing stagflation or recession, resulting instead in a bull market. He attributed this stability to the industry, saying:\n\u201c... This industry that spent billions upon billions of dollars to try to be as low carbon as possible is the reason why oil prices have actually come down during this period. They've gotten so much production that OPEC is now powerless.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTurning his attention to the broader oil industry, Cramer explored the role of oil service companies that facilitate production, including offshore drillers. He recalled becoming optimistic about oil service stocks earlier in the year, anticipating higher energy prices but admitted that this expectation did not materialize due to economic concerns dampening oil and gas markets. Despite current investor reluctance toward oil service stocks, Cramer suggested that sentiment could shift over time, especially because of the Federal Reserve's recent rate cutting.\n\u201cNow that the FED is our friend and more rate cuts are on the table, that's good news for the industry. I am not worried about the election either. If Trump wins, maybe we're back to that \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d thing. If Harris wins, we get exactly what we've had the last four years. Not ideal for the industry but it's still led to record oil and gas production here in the United States.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 23 and 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nCramer expressed enthusiasm about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) and said, \u201cBuy. Charitable Trust name, doing incredibly well\u2026 I like Broadcom, I like Hock Tan.\u201d\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) specializes in the design, development, and supply of semiconductor devices, building on a strong foundation in semiconductor innovation. In the third quarter, the company reported total revenue of $13.1 billion, marking a significant increase of 47% from the same period last year. A contributor to this growth has been the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products and services, which brought in $3.1 billion during the quarter.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects that AI will become a key driver of growth moving forward, projecting $3.5 billion in AI revenue for the upcoming fourth quarter. The company has found considerable success in providing custom AI accelerators, specialized chips designed to handle AI workloads, to major hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. In the third quarter, sales of these AI accelerators skyrocketed, increasing by three and a half times compared to the previous year.\nOn October 14, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $220 from $190 and maintained an Outperform rating. The firm forecasts tailwinds in artificial intelligence, custom silicon, and networking through 2025 and 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AVGO) the Best FAANG Stock To Buy According to Analysts?\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nAnalyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 10.9%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters.\n2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies such as the industry\u2019s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. To keep its strategy active, on October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom\u2019s subsidiary, T-Systems. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider.\nOn June 13, Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, appeared in an Interview on Yahoo Finance where she shared her bullish stance on AVGO. Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man\u2019s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components.\nAs Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\"\nOverall AVGO ranks 4th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.

In this piece, we will look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) sits on the fund managers' radar.\nThe surge in interest surrounding artificial intelligence has meant that the stock market in 2024 has continued to surprise. Just like most Wall Street analysts were left scratching their heads after worries of a recession proved to be unfounded, this year, analysts have continued to revise their year end targets of the flagship S&P index multiple times. Take the example of investment bank Goldman Sachs. Its latest index year end target was released in October, and as of now, the bank believes that the index will close at 6,000 points by the end of this year.\nBefore the October target, the bank had upped its year end estimate to 5,600 points in June. This was based on optimism for big tech stocks and the rush surrounding AI that continued to fuel them. This had added 400 points to the previous target of 5,200 points which was released in February, and this in turn had added 100 points to the previous upward revision of 5,100 over the first Goldman Sachs S&P year end target of 4,700 points.\nSafe to say, the market has beaten expectations in 2024. Its recent value of 5,832 points leaves it just 2.8% shy of Goldman\u2019s latest 2024 estimate. The index is up by 23.6% year to date, and to see just how much its returns have been driven by artificial intelligence, consider the fact that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange\u2019s semiconductor stock index is up 27.8% year to date. AI, and particularly semiconductor stocks, continue to make their mark and the key question now is whether this performance will be sustained after the third quarter earnings season.\nThe Q2 season was nothing short of fireworks for some of the biggest AI names. Two firms in particular come to mind when we reminisce. The first is Wall Street\u2019s AI darling which is known for making the best AI GPUs in the world, and the second is the firm behind Windows OS that has invested billions of dollars in the AI upstart OpenAI.\u00a0 Both these stocks did well in the first half of 2024 but pared back some of their gains in H2. Starting from the GPU company, its stock is up 186% year to date. However, from the peak in June which had marked 181% in YTD gains back then, the shares are up by a modest 1.84%. For the software company, the shares peaked at 26% year to date returns before the Q2 earnings season, and since the peak, they are down 10.4%.\nStory Continues\nThe difference in their share price appreciation isn\u2019t surprising even though it might appear to be so. Simply put, the reason the GPU maker has posted stronger returns is its products are the immediate need of the AI industry. On the other hand, the software company\u2019s products are part of a later wave of AI which counts upon strong demand for AI products within the business world to enable it to turn a profit. Turning a profit is key since it has already invested billions of dollars into OpenAI.

Research from BofA covering their performance for the first quarter shows that 64% of actively managed large cap US mutual funds beat their benchmarks. This was a sizeable jump over 38% of funds beating the benchmarks last year, with the bank speculating that a broadening of equities performance was part of the reason driving the returns. A study from The Wall Street Journal adds to this. It looks at the performance of large cap growth funds during H1 2024 and shares that the Magnificent 7 stocks drove large cap growth funds to the top of the mutual fund pyramid. The survey looked at 1,218 funds to determine that just 15% were in the red, with the average 12 month return of all the surveyed funds being 16.5%.\nWhile on one end of the spectrum are the risk averse mutual funds, on the other, are hedge funds that chase alpha through leverage. This risk means that the funds can accumulate large losses that take years to recover from. This is the case for some of the funds, according to Goldman\u2019s latest industry report. It shows that Tiger Global, Whale Rock, and Third Point which fell 50%+, 45%, and 21.8% in 2022 still haven\u2019t recovered. In 2023, the three respective funds posted 28.5%, 18%, and 4.1%, while their performance through July was 10.7% and 10.9% for Tiger Global and Third Point and 18.9% through May for Whale Rock.\nIn fact, GS\u2019 data shows that roughly one third of long-short funds are yet to recover their 2022 losses, as they are joined by 31% of event driven funds and 45% of macro driven funds. However, some of the top performing funds in the first half were Bridgewater Associates and Citadel, which posted 14.1% and 13.7% in returns respectively. The top performer among hedge funds appears to be AQR Capital with its long/short fund delivering 16.3% in returns.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that hedge funds and mutual funds love and hate, we divided Goldman\u2019s Hedge Fund Trend Monitor and Mutual Fundamentals report into four categories. These categories are stocks that both avoid, stocks that both love, and stocks favored by one but avoided by the other.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s ASIC division means that it is able to design and sell chips tailor made for custom use cases. These are important in the AI era as well, especially since the industry\u2019s mainstay GPUs from NVIDIA are in short supply and costly. Subsequently, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) can benefit from a growth in industry interest towards developing custom AI chips. On the software front, the firm benefits from high margin revenue through its cybersecurity division. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s fiscal Q3 saw software revenue jump by 300% due to its VMWare acquisition.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 15th on our list of stocks that fund managers love and hate according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery.

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -3.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.4% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.13 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for AVGO _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 14.3% below.\nAfter much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank\u2019s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\nWhile some processors and graphics chips stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.5% since the latest earnings results.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nOriginally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.\nBroadcom reported revenues of $13.07 billion, up 47.3% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, and overall, it was a satisfactory quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates but underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter.\n\"Broadcom's third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity.

Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nBroadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. The company expects about $12 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2024, which means 20% of its total revenue will come from AI and counting.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 10 Stocks with Consistent Growth to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks with consistent growth to buy.\nCurrently, financial markets are experiencing a mix of optimism and caution as investors react to changing economic conditions. Many are closely watching trends and data that could impact future growth and stability.\nTom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently shared his insights on the current market trends during an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 14. He acknowledged that he underestimated the strength of the market, noting that it has been surprisingly resilient despite expectations of volatility leading up to the 2024 election. Lee highlighted that there is a significant amount of cash\u2014about $6 trillion\u2014sitting on the sidelines, which has contributed to the market\u2019s stability. He observed that many investors had anticipated a recession, but instead, companies have shown strong earnings and resilience.\nLee also mentioned that the Federal Reserve is likely to adopt a supportive stance as inflation data continues to trend toward their 2% target. He believes that regardless of who wins the upcoming election, stocks are likely to perform well in the following year. Lee pointed out that markets tend to thrive on visibility and certainty, suggesting that if one candidate appears to be gaining an advantage, it could lead to a more favorable trading environment before the election. Overall, he remains optimistic about the market\u2019s outlook.\nS&P 500 and Dow Reach New Heights Ahead of Election Season\nOn October 18, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached new record highs, marking six consecutive weeks of gains for these major indices. As reported by CNBC, the S&P 500 rose by 0.40%, closing at 5,864.67, while the Dow rose by 0.09% and added 36.86 points to close at 43,275.91. The Nasdaq also performed well, increasing 0.63% to close at 18,489.55. This marks the longest winning streak of the year for both the Dow and S&P 500, with notable increases in their overall performance.\nAs earnings season progresses, over 70 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their results, with about 75% of those companies surpassing expectations. Despite potential market volatility leading up to the upcoming election, some analysts believe that stocks may continue to rise through November.\nRob Williams, a chief investment strategist at Sage Advisory, noted that this trend is unusual for an election year, where markets typically hesitate before improving post-election. He suggested that investors might be optimistic about a possible victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose policies are seen as more favorable for businesses in terms of regulations and taxes.\nStory Continues\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 30 stocks.\nNext, we focused on identifying stocks that had demonstrated consistent growth. From the initial list, we narrowed our choices to stocks that have grown their revenue positively over the past 5 years. We further refined our selection to include only those that had positive revenue growth each year in their last five reported annual revenues.\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the revenue CAGR over the past five years, and Macrotrends, which offered information on historical annual revenue data. Finally, we have ranked the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy below in ascending order based on their five-year revenue CAGR.\nAdditionally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds as of Q2 of 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBroadcom (AVGO): Consistent Growth Through AI Semiconductor Innovation\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 16.03%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American technology company that designs, develops, and manufactures a wide range of semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions. Some of its solutions include service provider and enterprise networking and storage, mobile device and broadband connectivity, mainframe, cybersecurity, and private and hybrid cloud infrastructure. The company\u2019s product portfolio serves the data center, networking, enterprise software, broadband, wireless, storage, and industrial markets.\nThe company is strategically positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for AI semiconductors. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has developed specialized AI chip designs tailored to meet the specific needs of hyperscale cloud providers, allowing it to cater effectively to their requirements. The company has secured partnerships with major clients like Google, Meta, and ByteDance for its AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), with Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI expected to join this list soon.\nIn addition to its semiconductor advancements, the company\u2019s acquisition of VMware has significantly boosted its infrastructure software revenue, which saw a remarkable 200% year-over-year increase. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.8 billion, with VMware contributing $3.8 billion in Q3 alone. This growth reflects the successful integration of VMware\u2019s offerings, as evidenced by the booking of over 15 million CPU cores of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) during the quarter.\nOverall, Broadcom Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) strong performance in both semiconductor and software segments positions it well for future growth, making it an attractive stock option for investors.\nOver the last five years, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has maintained a steady revenue increase. This consistent performance underscores the company\u2019s strength in its industry.\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds, 130 hedge funds held stakes in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).\u00a0ClearBridge Investments\u00a0stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its \u201cClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy\u201d Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of stocks with consistent growth to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter.

          "whole_article": "Investors in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) had a good week, as its shares rose 3.2% to close at US$951 following the release of its quarterly results. Revenues were US$2.8b, approximately in line with whatthe analysts expected, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$2.07, an impressive 31% ahead of estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Good afternoon, everyone, I really appreciate you joining today. Because a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report, I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow is growth trajectory. First is elite level execution, with our Q3 results we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution.\nWe outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand. The defense logistics agency works with ServiceNow assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project. Bangkok de Brazil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation.\nThe Veterans Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the Veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI powered solutions to improve its colleague experience.\nAfter rolling out now assist globally, EY works with ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks to deliver faster resolutions for enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life saving mission.\nMercedes Benz work to its ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

Looking ahead, its subscription revenue guidance for next quarter came in ahead.

Overall, this was a strong quarter.\nIs now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million.\nAlso, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 39.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $959.64 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,034.\nStory Continues\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nDespite the impressive results, some analysts have pointed to a slight deceleration in the growth of current remaining performance obligations (cRPO), signaling potential hurdles in the coming quarters. Yet, the raised full-year subscription revenue guidance to $10.66 billion and a substantial 36% increase in total remaining performance obligations indicate confidence in sustaining the growth trajectory. With multiple price target upgrades from BofA, RBC, and other top firms, investor sentiment remains strong, underpinned by ServiceNow's continued momentum in AI and digital transformation initiatives.\nLooking forward, the company is doubling down on global expansion, committing $1.5 billion to boost its UK operations and unveiling new data centers in Italy to meet rising demand. The appointment of Amit Zavery as CPO and COO, coupled with aggressive AI investments, signals ServiceNow's readiness to capitalize on the generative AI boom into 2025 and beyond. As businesses worldwide ramp up digital transformation efforts, ServiceNow's blend of innovation, execution, and strategic partnerships positions it to navigate the opportunities and challenges ahead with confidence.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Current remaining performance obligation, a measure of booked sales, increased 26% in the period ending Sept. 30. Both exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company makes applications that help companies organize and automate their personnel and information technology operations. Like its peers, ServiceNow is baking generative AI features into its products and offers a pricier tier with those tools.\nThe company\u2019s main generative AI assistant product, Now Assist, is the fastest-growing in company history, Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott said in an interview. The average contract premium for users of Now Assist is 30%, he added.\nThe shares hit a record high Thursday in New York, jumping about 6%. Investors were initially unimpressed with the results, with the stock trading down Wednesday evening. The shares had increased 28% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close. That\u2019s more than twice the rally seen in the iShares Expanded Software ETF, which is often used as a sector benchmark.\nThe results \u201cvalidate the company\u2019s rare standing in enterprise software,\u201d wrote Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup. He cited strong execution in a tough environment for tech spending and early monetization of generative AI.\nIn recent weeks, ServiceNow and software peers like Salesforce Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have begun emphasizing AI \u201cagents\u201d that can complete tasks without user supervision. Some customers are already trying ServiceNow\u2019s agents, which will be released more broadly next month, McDermott said. Once the agents are fully rolled out, they\u2019ll be priced differently from other products, McDermott added.\nFor the current quarter ending in December, ServiceNow projected subscription revenue of about $2.88 billion, just ahead of analyst estimates. The company expects near-term bookings to rise 21.5%.\nThis bookings guidance was effectively \u201cgood, but not great,\u201d Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note. He added that the company tends to issue conservative forecasts for the fourth quarter.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also announced the hiring of a leader from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Cloud for a prominent role. Amit Zavery will fill titles vacated earlier this year by CJ Desai as president, chief product officer and chief operating officer. Zavery will focus on product and engineering, McDermott said. His first-year compensation is targeted at about $2 million, with a $3 million signing bonus, according to a filing.\nDesai left the company in July after a complaint about a government contract and the hiring of a former US Army technology leader. He has since been tapped for a high-level executive role at Cloudflare Inc.\nLast month, Bloomberg reported that Carahsoft Technology Corp., a government-focused technology reseller, was under investigation alongside SAP SE for potentially conspiring to overcharge federal agencies.\nCarahsoft is also a major partner of ServiceNow\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re currently not involved in any issues related to Carahsoft and the US federal business,\u201d McDermott said when asked about the issue during a call with analysts Wednesday.\nProfit, excluding some items, was $3.72 per share, ahead of analyst estimates. The company saw a spike in large deals worth more than $5 million in annual contract value, it said.\nServiceNow hired more than 1,200 workers in the quarter. The company now has 25,743 employees. Much of the hiring is of quota-bearing sales representatives, which shows \u201cour confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Gina Mastantuono during the call.\n(Updates share reaction in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 97\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0April 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cUS-based software company,ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW), provided another strong result, continuing its long and consistent track record of 20%-plus revenue growth combined with healthy profitability. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year to $2.5 billion and free cash flow grew 47% year-on-year to $1.2 billion. The company\u2019s core operating metrics were also impressive with remaining performance obligations growing 26% year-on-year to $17.7 billion (i.e. roughly 2x 2023 revenue) and renewal rates holding steady at 98%. Performance was evenly spread across segments, products, and geographies, with notable strength in the US federal government. The company now boasts 1,933 customers generating in excess of $1 million in Annual Contract Value (ACV), which is pleasing to see as it implies multiple solutions are involved and that the company\u2019s platform model is increasingly resonating with customers. In our view, ServiceNow is one the highest quality software businesses globally as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it a compelling opportunity.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Touting the feature as \u201cthe new apps,\u201d Microsoft hailed its ability to simplify enterprise tasks, saying initial pilots showed a 90% reduction in lead times and a 30% reduction in administrative work.\n\u2022 USD\n(CRM)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n\u201cThe impact of this is tremendous,\u201d said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, speaking in London. He added, \u201cWe now have at-scale evidence of how these tools are fundamentally changing, \u2026 increasing value, and reducing waste.\u201d\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at the company's annual conference for software developers on May 6, 2019, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe announcement came just weeks after Salesforce announced the buildout of its own autonomous agents through the Agentforce platform, underscoring the AI-driven opportunity companies see in enterprise.\nHailed by Salesforce as the third wave in the AI revolution, customized agents enable companies to move beyond traditional chatbots that answer to preprogrammed responses to digital assistants that can reason, tackle multiple tasks at the same time, and make judgments based on a broader set of data.\nSalesforce AI CEO Clara Shih said the use cases are especially abundant in customer relations management, where agents can handle everything from product returns to crafting sales pitches.\n\u201cIt goes from being a single step prescribing, almost micromanaging what the AI should do versus asking the agent to figure out what it needs to do,\u201d said Shih in an interview with Yahoo Finance (video above).\nMicrosoft, Salesforce tout digital assistants as the future\nOther companies have touted their own specialized use cases for AI agents.\nCloud software provider ServiceNow (NOW) has announced plans to integrate AI agents into its human resources and IT platform. Dating app Grindr is working on an AI agent wingman that would seek out relationship prospects and help set up dates. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) helps clients develop their own agents for internal use, including legal work.\nAnd in a recent podcast interview, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang envisioned a future where 100 million AI agents would be deployed within the company.\n\u201cOur inbox is going to be full of directories of AIs that we work with,\u201d he said. \u201cAIs will recruit other AIs to solve problems. AIs will be in Slack channels with each other and with humans.\u201d\nStory Continues\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks onstage with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff during Salesforce's Dreamforce on Sept. 17, 2024, in San Francisco, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \u00b7 Justin Sullivan via Getty Images\nHowever, the battle over autonomous agents has pit Salesforce and Microsoft against each other in particular, in part because the companies have clashed publicly but also because of the trove of enterprise data both have access to. CEO Marc Benioff has repeatedly likened Microsoft\u2019s Copilot to Clippy, its doomed Office assistant from the 1990s, once listed as one of Time\u2019s 50 worst inventions.\nAt its Dreamforce event last month, Shih doubled down on the criticism, without naming Microsoft directly, while touting the Agentforce platform.\n\u201cThis is the difference between a DIY science project versus a real enterprise-grade agent you can confidently deploy into production,\u201d Shih said. She added that Salesforce agents showed 33% greater accuracy and \u201ctwo times greater relevance\u201d than competitors, according to customer benchmarks.\nEarlier this week, Microsoft said agent deployment in companies like McKinsey & Company and UK-based Pets at Home have already been shown to cut down on time spent processing time-consuming work, including data entry.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nWith the wider release of Agentforce set for Oct. 29, Shih emphasized that these agents are not meant to replace human workers but assist them so that \u201chumans can start at higher level.\u201d\nShih expects Salesforce\u2019s advantage to grow as the battle for digital assistants heats up because of its ability to connect individual clients\u2019 data through Data Cloud and the safety layers in place for Agentforce.\nShe said human interaction with digital assistants will \u201cgrow exponentially.\u201d\n\u201cI think it's similar to asking the question maybe in 1998 of, in the future, how many other interactions will be through the internet or some sort of digital medium,\u201d Shih said. \u201cI very much believe that agents will play that role in the future. Agents will become the apps that all of us interface with.\u201d\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"
