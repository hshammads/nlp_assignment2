          "whole_article": "By Ricardo Brito\nBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Collective Defense Institute, a consumer rights group, has filed two lawsuits demanding 3 billion reais ($525.27 million) from the Brazilian units of TikTok, Kwai and Meta Platforms for allegedly failing to create mechanisms to prevent indiscriminate use of these social media platforms by minors, according to initial petitions reviewed by Reuters.\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\nSocial media regulation has become a hot topic in Latin America's largest country after a months-long feud between X owner Elon Musk and a Brazilian Supreme Court justice resulted in the company paying hefty fines.\nDETAILS\nThe lawsuits demand the companies create clear data protection mechanisms and issue warnings about the risks to children's and teenagers' mental health due to platform addiction.\nThe lawsuits are based on a series of studies on the possible damage caused by unsupervised use of social media, especially by children and teenagers.\nKEY QUOTE\n\"It is urgent that measures be adopted in order to change the way the algorithm works, the processing of data from users under 18, and the way in which teenagers aged 13 and over are supervised and their accounts created, in order to ensure a safer, healthier experience ... as is already the case in developed countries,\" said lawyer Lillian Salgado, one of the plaintiffs.\nTHE RESPONSE\nMeta Platforms said in a statement that it wants \"young people to have safe and age-appropriate experiences on our apps, and we have been working on these issues for over a decade, developing more than 50 tools, resources, and features to support teens and their guardians.\"\nThe company, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, also said it had recently announced a new \"Teen Account\" on Instagram, which will arrive in Brazil soon and promises to automatically limit the accounts teenagers can see and who may contact them.\nTikTok said it had not received any notice about the case, while Kwai, a social media site based around short videos, said in a statement that user safety is one of its priorities, specially when it comes to minors.\n($1 = 5.7113 reais)\n(Reporting by Ricardo Brito in Brasilia; Additional reporting by Patricia Vilas Boas in Sao Paulo; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\nView Comments"

The Q3 cycle looks to be positive, underpinned by another robust showing from technology.\nAnd next week, we have several Mag 7 members on the reporting docket, a list that includes Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL.\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at individual expectations.\nAmazon's AWS in Focus\nAnalysts have shown a hint of bearishness for the upcoming release, with the $1.14 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 4% since the beginning of August. Decent growth is expected, with the estimate suggesting 34% growth year-over-year.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConcerning Amazon, the company\u2019s AWS results have become a focal point over recent years, which have overall been positive over recent periods. As shown below, AWS results have exceeded our consensus expectations in four of its last six releases.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta CapEx in Focus\nEarnings expectations for the quarter to be reported have remained positive since the beginning of August, with the $5.17 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 2% since and suggesting 18% growth year-over-year. Positive earnings estimate revisions have landed the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRevenue revisions have followed a similar trajectory, with the company expected to see 17% sales growth from the year-ago period. As usual, the company\u2019s advertising performance will be a focal point, which has performed strongly over recent periods partly thanks to the implementation of AI capabilities.\nApple's iPhone Sales in Focus\nExpectations for Apple\u2019s upcoming release have reflected slight bearishness, with downward revisions recently hitting the tape near the beginning of October. Modest growth is forecasted, with the current $1.54 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting a 5% climb year-over-year.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nA key item to keep an eye on during the upcoming release is the company\u2019s iPhone results, which generally always take center stage. Investors should expect a decent bit of commentary surrounding the new iPhone 16 and the upcoming AI capabilities that the company has been touting over recent months.\nBottom Line\nWe\u2019ve got several notable companies \u2013 Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta Platforms META \u2013 on the reporting docket for next week, who will help kick off the reporting cycle for the broader Mag 7 group.\nStory Continues\nInvestors should keep a close watch on META\u2019s commentary surrounding CapEx, iPhone results from Apple, and AWS results from Amazon.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is set to release quarterly results after the bell on Tuesday, kicking off a big earnings week for US tech giants after a wobbly run on Wall Street.\nThe company is expected to offer updates on its efforts to turn massive AI investments into new revenue streams and its position in the massive digital ad market.\nHere\u2019s what Wall Street is expecting for some of Alphabet\u2019s most significant metrics in the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter, according to Bloomberg data:\nRevenue: $86.44 billion expected ($76.69 billion in Q3 2023)\nAdjusted earnings per share: $1.83 expected ($1.55 in Q3 2023)\nCloud revenue: $10.79 billion expected ($8.41 billion in Q3 2023)\nAd revenue: $65.5 billion expected ($59.65 billion in Q3 2023)\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nLast year, Google was widely seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. But in the quarters since, Google has attempted to advance its own leadership position. Earlier this month, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sent a note to employees outlining another internal reorganization, shifting personnel to prioritize AI development.\nAnd last week, the Information reported that the company is developing AI-driven technology that takes over a web browser to complete tasks such as buying products or booking a flight. The report said that Google could preview the technology as early as December.\nAnalysts will be looking to probe the company\u2019s progress on AI integration to get a better read on the costs of developing sophisticated AI technologies. Capital expenditures are expected to exceed $12 billion for the quarter.\nEarlier this month Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sent a note to employees discussing shifting personnel to prioritize AI development, including placing the Gemini app team under Google DeepMind. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIndustry watchers also anticipate an expansion of Google's cloud business, an increasingly important segment to investors because of its use in the development of artificial intelligence. Wall Street projects Google Cloud revenue to register nearly $11 billion, boasting a roughly 28% increase from the same period last year.\n\u201cWe think GOOGL has the best cloud infrastructure for the AI era and, as a result, should allow it to better manage its cost profile compared to other cloud providers, while also benefiting from a host of new revenue opportunities,\u201d said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA Research, in a note.\nAlphabet's report arrives during a turbulent moment for the company.\nEarlier this month, the US Justice Department said in court filing that it may recommend a break-up of the company to boost competition in the search engine market. The DOJ is expected to provide a more detailed document by Nov. 20 outlining their proposed remedies.\nStory Continues\nMegacap earnings fall just a week before the tight contest between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, adding another element of unpredictability.\nAlphabet falls in the bottom half when it comes to \"Magnificent Seven\" stock performance, gaining 20% so far this year \u2014 well below Meta's (META) and Nvidia's (NVDA) spectacular climbs, but ahead of Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft's (MSFT) respective gains of 14% and 10%.\nSome analysts who are bullish on the stock see its relative affordability as an attractive feature.\n\u201cWhile we don't view the upcoming quarterly report as a likely catalyst for Alphabet, we do think shares are attractive at current levels with shares trading below the market multiple,\u201d said Wedbush analysts in a preview note.\n\u201cWe think there is a case for multiple expansion for Alphabet in the coming quarters and years as investors gain more comfort related to regulatory risk and the impact of generative AI on Google Search.\u201d\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone.\n\nIt witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world.

Five of the Magnificent 7 stocks are reporting earnings including Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc.\nOf the other two Magnificent 7 stocks, Tesla reported better-than-expected earnings last week and NVIDIA Corp. will report earnings in late November.\nHow Good Are Their Earnings Surprise Records?\nThat means all eyes will be on the \u201cMag 5\u201d this week. As a group, they have surprisingly good earnings surprise track records.\nWhile none have perfect 5-year records, two of them have only missed once during that period. All of them have earnings streaks going into this report of at least 6 beats in a row.\nAnalysts are also bullish on some of the companies ahead of the report which says a lot. For example, 2 estimates have been revised higher for the quarter on Alphabet in the last week.\nThe analysts don\u2019t like to get it wrong on earnings. They will only raise estimates ahead of a report if they are confident that the quarter is going to be better than originally expected.\nWill these Magnificent 7 stocks be able to meet high expectations this week?\nHere Come the Mag 5 Earnings Reports\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\nAlphabet has beat 6 quarters in a row. Analysts are bullish, raising earnings estimates going into this report.\nShares of Alphabet have lagged the S&P 500 this year. It\u2019s up 20.1% versus the S&P 500 up 23%. But Alphabet is also the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 stocks. It trades at just 21.6x forward earnings.\nShould Alphabet be on the short list for value investors?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nApple has beat 6 quarters in a row. It has only missed once in the last 5 years. That\u2019s an impressive record with the pandemic in that period.\nShares of Apple are up 25.8% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 at 23%. It\u2019s not cheap. Apple trades with a forward P/E of 31 and earnings are expected to be up just 8.5% this year.\nWill Apple surprise again this quarter?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\nMicrosoft has beat 8 quarters in a row. It also has only missed once in the last 5 years, in 2022.\nShares of Microsoft have lagged with a gain of just 15.5% year-to-date. It\u2019s the poorest performer of these 5 stocks. It\u2019s not cheap either. Microsoft trades with a forward P/E of 32.9.\nEarnings are expected to rise 10.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025.\nIs that earnings growth good enough or does Microsoft have to step up its game?\nStory Continues\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\nMeta Platforms has beat on earnings 7 quarters in a row. It has only missed 4 times in the last 5 years.\nShares of Meta Platforms are up 66.5% year-to-date making it the best performing stock of the Magnificent 7 stocks reporting this week. It\u2019s been busting out to new all-time highs this year.\nMeta Platforms is still attractively priced with a forward P/E of 26.7.\nShould investors get into Meta Platforms here?\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\nAmazon has beat 7 quarters in a row.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of BofA\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stocks with The Fastest Projected EPS Growth Rates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best BofA's top growth stocks with the fastest projected EPS growth rates.\nFor the stock market, if there\u2019s one thing that can be said with some certainty, it\u2019s that earnings and revenue growth drives share price performance. This is because a firm\u2019s stock price is a reflection of investor estimates of its future market potential. Firms that are believed to gain market share in the future often see their share price surge in the present as investors tailor their portfolios to try to get an early position in some of the biggest names of tomorrow.\nIn fact, we don\u2019t have to dig too deep to see this principle in action. The clearest example of it is in the stock of the AI chips company that\u2019s Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI stock so far. Its stock is up 199% year to date, 235% over the past twelve months, and 887% since the start of 2023. While all these returns are something that most\u2013if not all\u2013company executives would give an arm and a leg for, to see our principle in action, we\u2019ll have to dig deeper into the 887% share price gain.\nNarrowing down our analysis to this stock\u2019s performance in 2023\u2013from the start and to the end of the year\u2013its shares gained 239%. During the first half, they gained 189.5% and during Q1, the stock was up 90%. So, the shares\u2019 performance in Q2 has proven crucial as the starting point of a rally that has so far yielded an 887% share price appreciation. During Q2, the stock was up 52%, driven by the fact that on May 24th, 2023 (during the Q1FY24 earnings), the firm\u2019s CEO stunned investors when he shared that \u201cA trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.\u201d\nThis meant that CEO Jensen Huang believed that in the future, businesses would spend as much as $1 trillion on his company\u2019s products. Investors were ecstatic and they piled into the company to send its shares soaring by 24.6% between May 19th and May 26th. In this company\u2019s case, the CEO\u2019s optimism was also met by cold, hard results. During the same Q1, the firm\u2019s data center business division revenue jumped by 14% annually, in a sign that foretold the growth story of the next quarters. Mind you, this fiscal Q1 was only the second quarter following OpenAI\u2019s public ChatGPT release, so the AI wave that solidified in Q4 2024 was in its infancy.\nStory Continues\nThese hard results saw the firm annually grow its revenue by 101%, 206%, 265%, 262%, and 122% in its Q2FY24, Q3FY24, Q4FY24, Q1FY25, and Q2FY25, respectively. The top line growth has been accompanied by bottom line profits also jumping by triple digit percentages in all of the quarters. The highest reading was for Q2FY24 when its non-GAAP net income jumped by 843% year-over-year.\nThus, it\u2019s safe to say that growth is rewarded by the stock market. Yet, the high investor expectations for growth stocks also mean that they are punished harder in case they fail to meet expectations. Research from the University of Michigan analyzed data for 13 years covering consensus earnings forecasts, quarterly earnings, stock prices, market to book ratio, and price to earnings ratio to check whether growth and value stocks perform similarly if they fail to meet earnings expectations.\nTheir results\u00a0show\u00a0that growth stocks tend to fall more than value stocks when it comes to negative earnings surprises. The researchers add that the underperformance is typically before the earnings are announced since growth stocks typically preannounce their negative earnings surprise. A descriptive analysis of their data also shows that cumulative stock returns for the days between two earnings cycles are higher for low growth stocks over high growth stocks. For the lowest growth stocks, the cumulative returns for all firms analyzed were 0.66%, while those for firms with negative and positive earnings surprises were -3.57% and 5.44%, respectively. For the high growth stocks, cumulative returns for all firms were -0.58%, and the returns for those with negative and positive earnings surprises were -7.32% and 6.32%, respectively.\nThe research concisely sums up the potential of investing in growth stocks and the accompanying risks. Returning to our GPU designer, while right now it\u2019s at the center of the AI buzz, back in 2017 and 2018, it was at the center of the Bitcoin rush since gaming GPUs could also be used to mine cryptocurrencies. However, between mid-December 2017 and mid-December 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped by 83%. For the firm\u2019s quarter that ended in January 2019, this led to its gaming GPU revenue dropping by 45% year-over-year and 46% sequentially. This was because the crypto sector had over ordered GPUs, but as Bitcoin prices fell, mining became unprofitable and the over-ordering led to a glut in the market. Looking at the firm\u2019s post split stock price, this led to the stock falling by 53% between October and the end of December 2018.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of BofA\u2019s top growth stock picks, we used the bank\u2019s latest list of stocks that are rated Buy, have an EPS surprise rating, and the highest projected growth rates for the next five years. The stocks were ranked by their projected EPS growth rates.\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nMeta Platforms (META): Dominating Social Media and AI Innovation\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 219\nProjected EPS Growth Rate: 21.6%\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the biggest social media company in the world. Its 3.2 billion user base means that the firm is the go-to platform for advertisers. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s dominance in social media advertising has enabled the firm to accumulate sizable resources which enable it to develop leading edge technologies such as artificial intelligence. As of the latest quarter, the firm had $32 billion in cash and equivalents. These allow it to establish sizable data centers to train AI, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the few firms in the world that has developed its foundational AI model. Called Llama, it allows the firm to provide AI software to others to build their products. It also enables Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to blend AI into its products for advertisers by enabling them to use AI for features such as ad campaigns and customer support. It also enables the firm to provide AI features, such as image editing, to users with the hope of monetizing it in the future.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMeta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks 8th on our list of best BofA's top growth stocks with the fastest projected EPS growth rates. META is one of the top stocks with the highest consensus earnings growth according to BofA. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.\nAccording to the partnership agreement, Meta AI will rely on factual, accurate journalism from Reuters to respond to users' questions about events happening around the World, providing brief information with links to full news stories. This is in line with Reuters' experience in fact-checking, which it has managed to do effectively since the two parties entered into a partnership in 2020 to tackle fake news.\nSpecific details of the financial aspect of the deal were not disclosed, although it was disclosed that it would be a multiyear deal that guarantees Reuters its inputs. This partnership demonstrates how Reuters has understood the changes in the AI environment and how it seeks to bolster credible news sharing through ICT.\nThe move comes when Meta is set to reduce direct involvement in delivering news through the channels while inviting foundational news partnerships. This strategy is about improving the quality of information available through AI and is a general trend in the sphere where tech businesses like OpenAI or startups with immense backing from known figures partner with news suppliers to improve the AI interaction with real-time news. This changing pattern.

Crypto companies surged, and Bitcoin rose past $71,000 for the first time since June, as the former president is seen as supportive of the digital tokens.\nA victory for Trump would be more beneficial for stocks and Bitcoin relative to his Democratic opponent, while a Harris presidency would bring slightly more relief to housing costs, according to a Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey. Some 38% of respondents see equities accelerating a year from now under the Republican candidate, versus 13% under the Democrat.\nTrump\u2019s chances of a victory are increasing and \u201cthat\u2019s seen as good for US stocks in the short run,\u201d said Phillip Wool, head of portfolio management at Rayliant Global Advisors. \u201cDeficits will increase, inflation will come back, and it could slow Fed rate cuts.

That puts annual exports on track to surpass the about $10 billion of fiscal 2024.\nApple is expanding its manufacturing network in India at a rapid clip, taking advantage of local subsidies, a skilled workforce and advances in the country\u2019s technological capabilities. India is a crucial part of the company\u2019s effort to lessen its reliance on China, where risks have grown along with Beijing\u2019s tensions with the US.\nThree of Apple\u2019s suppliers \u2014 Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp., and homegrown Tata Electronics \u2014 assemble iPhones in southern India. Foxconn\u2019s local unit, based on the outskirts of Chennai, is the top supplier in India and accounts for half of the country\u2019s iPhone exports.\nSalt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group\u2019s electronics manufacturing arm exported about $1.7 billion in iPhones from its factory in Karnataka state from April to September, the people said. Tata acquired this unit from Wistron Corp. last year, becoming the first Indian assembler of Apple\u2019s bestselling product.\nThe dollar figure refers to the devices\u2019 estimated factory gate value, not the retail price. Representatives for Apple declined to comment. Pegatron also declined to comment, while Foxconn and Tata spokespersons didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nIPhones account for the bulk of India\u2019s smartphone exports and helped the product category become the top export to the US at $2.88 billion in the first five months of this fiscal year, according to federal trade ministry data. Five years ago, before Apple expanded manufacturing in India, the country\u2019s annual smartphone exports to the US were a meager $5.2 million.\nStill, Apple accounts for just under 7% of India\u2019s smartphone market, which is dominated by Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. And while still a small market for iPhones globally, Apple is making big bets.\nStory Continues\nThe subsidies by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration helped Apple assemble its pricey iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models, with better cameras and titanium bodies, in India this year. It\u2019s also seeking to open new retail stores, including in the southern tech hub of Bangalore and western city of Pune.\nLast year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook launched Apple\u2019s first shops in the financial hub of Mumbai and capital New Delhi.\nThe grand openings, the marketing blitz around the new stores, an aggressive online sales push as well as a rapidly growing middle class that aspires to own Apple products boosted its annual India revenue to a record of $8 billion in the year through March.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nIndia sales could reach $33 billion by 2030, we calculate, fueled primarily by rising middle-class purchasing power and a greater use of payment plans.\n- Anurag Rana & Andrew Girard, analysts\nClick here for research\nApple\u2019s rising star in India contrasts with its flagging fortunes in China, whose economy has stuttered following harsh Covid-19 lockdowns and a property crisis. To be sure, Apple relies on China for a bulk of its manufacturing and sales, and India\u2019s unlikely to become its top market anytime soon.\nApple assembled $14 billion of iPhones in India in the fiscal year through March 2024, doubling production and accelerating its drive to diversify beyond China. Of that, it exported roughly $10 billion worth of iPhones.\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman and Jane Lanhee Lee.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Earnings season has picked up notable steam over the last week, with a nice variety of companies delivering quarterly results. The Q3 cycle looks to be positive, underpinned by another robust showing from technology.\nAnd next week, we have several Mag 7 members on the reporting docket, a list that includes Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL.\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at individual expectations.\nAmazon's AWS in Focus\nAnalysts have shown a hint of bearishness for the upcoming release, with the $1.14 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 4% since the beginning of August. Decent growth is expected, with the estimate suggesting 34% growth year-over-year.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConcerning Amazon, the company\u2019s AWS results have become a focal point over recent years, which have overall been positive over recent periods. As shown below, AWS results have exceeded our consensus expectations in four of its last six releases.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta CapEx in Focus\nEarnings expectations for the quarter to be reported have remained positive since the beginning of August, with the $5.17 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 2% since and suggesting 18% growth year-over-year. Positive earnings estimate revisions have landed the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRevenue revisions have followed a similar trajectory, with the company expected to see 17% sales growth from the year-ago period. As usual, the company\u2019s advertising performance will be a focal point, which has performed strongly over recent periods partly thanks to the implementation of AI capabilities.\nApple's iPhone Sales in Focus\nExpectations for Apple\u2019s upcoming release have reflected slight bearishness, with downward revisions recently hitting the tape near the beginning of October. Modest growth is forecasted, with the current $1.54 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting a 5% climb year-over-year.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nA key item to keep an eye on during the upcoming release is the company\u2019s iPhone results, which generally always take center stage. Investors should expect a decent bit of commentary surrounding the new iPhone 16 and the upcoming AI capabilities that the company has been touting over recent months.\nBottom Line\nWe\u2019ve got several notable companies \u2013 Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta Platforms META \u2013 on the reporting docket for next week, who will help kick off the reporting cycle for the broader Mag 7 group.\nStory Continues\nInvestors should keep a close watch on META\u2019s commentary surrounding CapEx, iPhone results from Apple, and AWS results from Amazon.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Whether you're interested in cutting-edge technology, renewable energy, or healthcare innovations, our themes help you invest in ideas that matter to you.\nFor those interested in viewing the Thematic lists, please click here >>> Thematic Screens \u2013 Zacks Investment Research.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the \u2018Cloud Computing\u2019 theme and analyze a few stocks within.\nCloud Computing Overview\nCloud computing refers to the on-demand seamless access of computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (the cloud) on a pay-per-use pricing model.\nIt marks a paradigm shift from traditional on-premises infrastructure storage to remote cloud-based storage facilities and relies heavily on virtualization and automation technologies. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations access a virtual pool of shared resources from a cloud service provider on an as-needed basis.\nThis lowers operating costs, increases productivity with greater agility and flexibility, and improves scalability with higher economies of scale. Please click here for a direct link to the Cloud Computing thematic list \u2013 Cloud Computing.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at a stock that the screen returned.\nAmazon to Report Quarterly Results\nAmazon AMZN shares reflect an excellent opportunity for investors to obtain exposure to cloud computing thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the dominant player in the cloud computing market, flexing a significant market share globally. It provides various services, including computing power, storage, databases, and AI/ML tools.\nThe company is on the reporting docket for this week, with its results expected after the market\u2019s close on Thursday. Earnings expectations for the quarter to be reported have been slightly bearish, with the $1.14 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 4% since the beginning of August.\nStill, big growth is forecasted, with the estimate suggesting 34% EPS growth year-over-year.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs shown below, AWS results have exceeded our consensus expectations in four of its last six releases. For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus estimate for AWS revenue stands at $27.6 billion, nearly 20% higher than the year-ago period.\nThe YoY growth rate here in AWS is quite significant, with AWS now showing a reacceleration. Several periods of slowing growth raised concerns, but the AI frenzy has seemingly helped push those concerns to the side.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe valuation picture here isn\u2019t stretched, with the current 33.3X forward 12-month earnings multiple a fraction of the 60.3X five-year median and five-year highs of 123.4X. And the current PEG ratio works out to 1.2X, again well beneath historical averages.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIt\u2019s reasonable to expect extensive commentary surrounding AWS results given the current AI frenzy, which will likely dictate the post-earnings move. It\u2019s worth noting that shares have primarily consolidated over the last three months, perhaps setting up a strong post-earnings move if results please investors.\nBottom Line\nThematic investing has emerged as a powerful way for investors to sync their portfolios with emerging trends. A mix of long-term and short-term themes is increasingly dictating which companies lead as economies expand and markets shift.\nAnd upon running the Zacks Cloud Computing Thematic screen, Amazon AMZN was returned, who also reports quarterly results this week after the market\u2019s close on Thursday.\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "This is the biggest week for earnings of the entire third quarter earnings season. Five of the Magnificent 7 stocks are reporting earnings including Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc.\nOf the other two Magnificent 7 stocks, Tesla reported better-than-expected earnings last week and NVIDIA Corp. will report earnings in late November.\nHow Good Are Their Earnings Surprise Records?\nThat means all eyes will be on the \u201cMag 5\u201d this week. As a group, they have surprisingly good earnings surprise track records.\nWhile none have perfect 5-year records, two of them have only missed once during that period. All of them have earnings streaks going into this report of at least 6 beats in a row.\nAnalysts are also bullish on some of the companies ahead of the report which says a lot. For example, 2 estimates have been revised higher for the quarter on Alphabet in the last week.\nThe analysts don\u2019t like to get it wrong on earnings. They will only raise estimates ahead of a report if they are confident that the quarter is going to be better than originally expected.\nWill these Magnificent 7 stocks be able to meet high expectations this week?\nHere Come the Mag 5 Earnings Reports\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\nAlphabet has beat 6 quarters in a row. Analysts are bullish, raising earnings estimates going into this report.\nShares of Alphabet have lagged the S&P 500 this year. It\u2019s up 20.1% versus the S&P 500 up 23%. But Alphabet is also the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 stocks. It trades at just 21.6x forward earnings.\nShould Alphabet be on the short list for value investors?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nApple has beat 6 quarters in a row. It has only missed once in the last 5 years. That\u2019s an impressive record with the pandemic in that period.\nShares of Apple are up 25.8% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 at 23%. It\u2019s not cheap. Apple trades with a forward P/E of 31 and earnings are expected to be up just 8.5% this year.\nWill Apple surprise again this quarter?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\nMicrosoft has beat 8 quarters in a row. It also has only missed once in the last 5 years, in 2022.\nShares of Microsoft have lagged with a gain of just 15.5% year-to-date. It\u2019s the poorest performer of these 5 stocks. It\u2019s not cheap either. Microsoft trades with a forward P/E of 32.9.\nEarnings are expected to rise 10.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025.\nIs that earnings growth good enough or does Microsoft have to step up its game?\nStory Continues\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\nMeta Platforms has beat on earnings 7 quarters in a row. It has only missed 4 times in the last 5 years.\nShares of Meta Platforms are up 66.5% year-to-date making it the best performing stock of the Magnificent 7 stocks reporting this week. It\u2019s been busting out to new all-time highs this year.\nMeta Platforms is still attractively priced with a forward P/E of 26.7.\nShould investors get into Meta Platforms here?\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\nAmazon has beat 7 quarters in a row. For a company that historically hasn\u2019t cared if it missed, or beat, it has put together a nice earnings surprise streak.\nShares of Amazon are up 26.3% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 up 23%. Amazon hit new all-time highs earlier this year but are looking for another breakout.\nAmazon isn\u2019t cheap on a P/E basis, but it never has been. It trades with a forward P/E of 39.6. However, Amazon is expected to grow its earnings by double digits this year and next.\nShould Amazon be on your short list?\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "(Reuters) - Walmart said on Monday it would offer its membership service, Walmart Plus, at a 50% discount ahead of the holiday season, as the retailer attempts to close the gap with rival Amazon.com's Prime subscription service.\nThis year, U.S. retailers like Walmart have launched sales events earlier and added more deals and perks to attract shoppers coping with high inflation. The National Retail Federation forecasts U.S. holiday retail sales will grow up to 3.5%, the slowest pace in six years due to frugal spending.\nAs part of these early deals, Walmart is offering a one-year Walmart Plus membership for $49, down from its regular $98, from Monday through Dec. 2.\nThis move highlights Walmart's efforts to compete with Amazon Prime, which costs $139 per year and has over six times more subscribers. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Amazon Prime has 180 million U.S. subscribers, while eMarketer estimates Walmart Plus will reach 32 million by the end of this year.\nWalmart Plus offers benefits like express, same-day, and next-day deliveries, a free Paramount+ subscription, and ten cents off per gallon of gas. Amazon Prime members enjoy perks such as an annual Grubhub+ delivery subscription, early and exclusive deals on Prime Day, and free access to Amazon Music and Amazon Prime Video.\n(Reporting by Anuja Bharat Mistry in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)\nView Comments"

According to figures from Ofcom, 68pc of UK households reported using a streaming service in the first three months of 2024, up from 66pc in 2023.\nThe most popular services were Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, with Netflix remaining the most watched, averaging 21 minutes per person per day in 2023.\nHere, Telegraph Money takes a look at what each of the major TV streaming platforms offer, along with tips on how you can cut costs without sacrificing the films and TV shows you want to watch.\nNetflix\nNetflix, which began as a DVD postal service, launched its groundbreaking streaming service in 2007 and by 2010 it was available on most devices.\nIt now creates enormous amounts of original content, such as the shows Bridgerton, The Crown and Baby Reindeer, and films including Scoop and Academy Award winner All Quiet On The Western Front.\nPreviously the streaming service had a large library of older content, although this has been eroded by other content producers launching their own platforms.\nSubscription numbers dropped after its 2022 announcement that it would be cracking down on password sharing, but the platform also added a cheaper membership option \u2013 which comes with ad breaks. Its viewing figures have since recovered, and its latest count of paying viewers topped 282.7 million globally.\nUK customers now have to pay an extra \u00a34.99 per month on top of their existing subscription to share their account outside their home.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a34.99 for a standard account with adverts for two devices; \u00a310.99 for standard account for two devices (extra member slots outside your household can be added for \u00a34.99); \u00a315.99 for premium account for four devices (extra member slots can be added for \u00a34.99). All charges are monthly.\nCan you share your password? Not any more. Netflix wrote to users in May 2023 to inform them they could no longer share accounts with people outside of their household. However, those signed up for a standard or premium account can purchase extra member slots for people who don\u2019t live with them for \u00a34.99 a month.\nStory continues\nAmazon Prime\nThe Amazon Prime Video platform is just one part of the Prime subscription, which also offers services like Prime Reading and free delivery on qualifying Amazon orders. Like Netflix, it has a number of original films and TV shows, with big hitters including Clarkson\u2019s Farm, The Grand Tour and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\nAmazon also has the rights to show 20 matches of Premier League fixtures over the course of a season. Both rounds for this season have already been shown, and it will not have the rights from the 2025-26 season onwards.\nThe streaming service recently launched ads, meaning your content will be interrupted by regular adverts unless you pay an extra \u00a32.99 each month.\nCustomers can get a one-month free trial before the paid subscription kicks in, while students can get a free six-month trial.\nIf you don\u2019t want free delivery or any of the other Prime services, you can get a cheaper Prime Video subscription, which is just for the streaming service.\nNote that you can end up paying extra to rent or buy titles that aren\u2019t part of the free Prime viewing offer. Look out for the Amazon Prime banner, which indicates the free things you can watch, or check out the \u201cFree to me\u201d section. Some shows, such as Neighbours, are free with adverts on Amazon\u2019s Freevee service.\nIt is possible to link Amazon accounts with another adult in your household and up to two children in order to share Prime benefits, including Prime Video, meaning only one subscription per household is needed.\nAmazon has not announced a password crackdown, so even if you don\u2019t link accounts, you should be able to share the Prime Video benefits with friends and family.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a35.99 per month for Prime Video only; \u00a38.99 per month or \u00a395 per year (\u00a312.88 cheaper); for students it\u2019s \u00a34.49 per month or \u00a347.49 per year (\u00a36.39 cheaper). It costs \u00a32.99 extra each month to watch ad-free.\nCan you share your password? You can share your Prime membership with someone else in your household, meaning you can both also get perks like free deliveries. There\u2019s no mechanism in place to strictly prohibit password sharing with other people, but be aware they may be able to access the rest of your Amazon account.\nDisney+\nWith more than 153 million subscribers as of August 2024, Disney+ has caused a real stir in the streaming market since it launched in the UK in March 2020.\nOriginally designed to be the home of all much-loved children\u2019s Disney content, the platform has expanded with its Star Wars and Marvel content. It also hosts a number of series popular with adults, such as Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Modern Family and exclusive content such as Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals.\nIts popularity with older generations has increased, with subscribers aged over-64 rising from 7pc in 2022 to 12pc in 2023, according to Ofcom.\nUsers can access Disney\u2019s entire back catalogue from its 80-year history, and the service also has exclusive streaming of new Disney films \u2013 though if you want these new films early it can cost around \u00a319.99 extra, on top of your subscription.\nIn November 2023 Disney announced an ad-supported subscription plan for \u00a34.99.\nIt has also cracked down on password sharing, with the possibility of being blocked from the streaming service if it detects that the account is shared with people who don\u2019t live at the primary residence.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a34.99 per month for a standard account with adverts for two devices; \u00a38.99 a month or \u00a389.90 a year (\u00a317.98 cheaper) for a standard account for two devices; \u00a312.99 per month or \u00a3129.90 per year (\u00a325.98 cheaper) for a premium account for four devices. Since it cracked down on password sharing, you can add an extra member, not in your household, for \u00a33.99 per month with ads, or \u00a34.99 per month without ads.\nCan you share your password? As of September 2024 you can no longer share a Disney+ account with someone outside of your household. Its customer support defines a household as \u201cthe collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside therein.\u201d\nIf you want to share your account outside of your household, you have to pay \u00a33.99 per month to add an extra member, or \u00a34.99 per month for ad-free viewing.\nNOW TV\nLaunched in 2012, NOW is Sky\u2019s on-demand streaming service, and is the place to go for many blockbusters and fan-favourite shows such as Game Of Thrones and Succession.\nArguably the most customisable service out there, you can get \u201cpasses\u201d for the specific kinds of things you want to watch \u2013 the Entertainment Pass covers Sky TV series and box sets, as well as children\u2019s shows, and a Sport Pass lets you watch everything on Sky Sports, while a Hayu Pass allows you watch reality TV shows such as Real Housewives and Below Deck at the same time it\u2019s released in America, putting an end to spoilers.\nIn addition, you can choose how long you want to sign up for. Most passes come with a rolling monthly option, but the Sports Pass, for example, has a day pass option where you spend \u00a314.99 for 24-hour access to 12 live Sky Sports channels \u2013 ideal if there\u2019s just one particular match you want to watch.\nHowever, it can get expensive if you want access to all of the channels.\nWith the standard subscription for an Entertainment or Cinema Pass you can only stream on one device at a time, and will have to watch ads. You can add on a Boost subscription for \u00a36 per month to watch on two devices and watch ad-free, or Ultra Boost for \u00a39 which allows three devices and ad-free viewing.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a39.99 a month for Entertainment Pass or Cinema Pass; \u00a334.99 a month for Sport Pass; \u00a34.99 a month for Hayu Pass (for reality TV).\nCan you share your password? There\u2019s nothing strictly prohibiting password sharing, but you may come a cropper as only a limited number of streams can take place at the same time. To get three simultaneous streams, you need to sign up to the Boost service, which costs an extra \u00a39 a month after a seven-day free period.\nApple TV+\nWhile Apple TV+ was once one of the best value streaming services on the market, its \u00a36.99 monthly price has since risen to \u00a38.99, putting it broadly in-line with several other services.\nThe streaming service, which is free for three months to those who buy new Apple products, has however received criticism for its relatively small library, but the shows are Apple TV+ originals.\nAmong its big hitters are football-comedy-with-feelings Ted Lasso, and The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Anniston and Reese Witherspoon. Watching anything on Apple TV+ is ad-free.\nIn an Oscars upset, the streaming service became the first to win a Best Picture award for CODA, a heart-warming indie drama, beating offerings from the likes of Netflix.\nUp to five family members can be added to the subscription and the main account holder can stop others from making extra purchases via your Apple account \u2013 perfect for stopping small children overspending on your card.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a38.99 a month after a seven-day free trial.\nCan you share your password? You\u2019re encouraged to share your Apple TV+ account with up to five family members in your household. It\u2019s possible to share with people outside of your household, but you\u2019ll want to be extra careful about making sure the extra purchase option is turned off.\nParamount+\nLaunched in the UK in 2022, Paramount+ is vying to compete with the streaming mainstays of Amazon and Netflix.\nIt has a large catalogue of content \u2013 ranging from original shows, to programmes from channels like MTV and Comedy Central. It has also branched into Star Trek spin-off shows, and rebooted the US comedy Frasier.\nParamount\u2019s collection of films is also quite substantial, including 90s classics Titanic and Clueless, as well as more recent releases such as the Mean Girls musical.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a36.99 a month, or \u00a369.90 a year. It comes with a seven-day free trial. Sky Cinema subscribers can use the streaming service for free.\nCan you share your password?\u00a0Six profiles can be created with your account, so theoretically, you can share your account with five other people. Only two devices can be in use at once, so two people can watch Paramount+ at the same time from the same account.\nFree options and other ways to save\nIf you want to maintain access to the various streaming services, there are a few ways you can cut your costs.\nConsider rotating your subscriptions\nIf you\u2019re paying monthly, it can make sense to pause or cancel your account whenever you\u2019re not using it. For example, if you\u2019re signed up to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, you could pause two accounts while you focus on watching things on Netflix, the next month pause Netflix and focus on Disney+, and so on.\nShare whenever you can\nEven if you can\u2019t share your passwords \u2013 or don\u2019t want to \u2013 at least make sure there aren\u2019t multiple accounts being paid for within your household. Each service usually comes with more than enough available profiles for everyone to maintain their own list of things they\u2019re watching, and recommendations for further viewing. It\u2019s also possible to add parental controls to children\u2019s profiles, ensuring they can only view age-appropriate content.\nUse free trials\nMost streaming services offer free trials, of varying lengths. Getting three months of free Apple TV+, for example, is more than enough time to get through a couple of its best series \u2013 after which time you can simply cancel your subscription.\nCheck for bundles\nIn some cases, you can get a streaming service thrown in with certain mobile phone bundles \u2013 so make sure you\u2019re not paying for something you could be getting for free.\nFor example, Vodafone phone and SIM only customers can get its entertainment plan, which includes membership to YouTube Premium or Amazon Prime. Some Sky packages also come with Netflix thrown in; currently, you can get Sky Stream with Netflix (standard with ads) for \u00a328 per month for 24 months.\nOpt for free streaming\nWhile you will need a TV licence to watch BBC iPlayer and any live shows on other catch-up services, viewers can stream ITV X, My 5, and Channel 4 for free.\nAlternatively, Internet Archive, a free digital library, offers a large collection of films that are in the public domain \u2013 but don\u2019t expect to find the latest blockbusters. Top Documentary Films is a site perfect for when you want to learn something, offering thousands of insightful documentaries."

          "whole_article": "Let no one accuse Brian Williams of trying to lower expectations a week before his election night special coverage on Amazon Prime Video.\n\u201cThis will be the first \u2014 if you'll forgive the phrase \u2014 new product introduction in the election night space since color television,\u201d the former NBC News anchor said shortly after landing in Los Angeles, near where Amazon is building a set for him at its massive new studio.\nAmazon (AMZN) is the pioneer streaming service to compete in live news with television on its biggest night, a presidential election. And its headliner is the quintessential TV guy, one who told the world about the elections of Barack Obama and Donald Trump from Rockefeller Center for NBC News.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nWilliams, 65, is certainly well known, but he's asking potential viewers to take a leap of faith. Amazon has no track record in the election space and, unlike NBC, CNN, Fox News and others who will cover the results on Nov. 5, has no news division behind it. Williams said he and his executive producer, a fellow former NBC hand Jonathan Wald, have \u201cbuilt a temporary, one-night news division over the past 60 days.\u201d\nThey have contracted with The Associated Press for video and Reuters for results data, and hired a stable of commentators and journalists to work that night. They include some of Williams' frequent guests from when he hosted \u201cThe 11th Hour\u201d on MSNBC, including political consultants James Carville, Mike Murphy and writer-comedian Baratunde Thurston.\nFormer Fox News anchor Shepard Smith will be stationed at Democrat Kamala Harris' election night headquarters, with Tara Palmeri of Puck at Republican Trump's. Others on their one-night staff include historian Douglas Brinkley, former \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Abby Huntsman, the Washington Post's Jackie Alemany, ex-CNN and ABC News reporter Jessica Yellin and former U.S. Rep Tim Ryan of Ohio. Reporters from Axios, Politico and Puck will also be working for the Amazon team, Wald said.\nSome things will feel familiar\nIn many respects, it will be like a familiar election night television newscast \u2014 acceptance speeches aired, pundits opining. Amazon won't have its own decision desk, but the broadcast will discuss when other news organizations call individual states. \u201cAll viewpoints will be represented,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe are striving to cover it straight with minimal drama.\u201d\n\u201cNow that the \u2018magic walls\u2019 have been around for a few cycles, we get it, we understand it,\" he said. \"So we'll just trot out a few new things that viewers haven't seen before. There is a formula to election night. We're not going to break that.\u201d\nStory Continues\nThey'll operate from the giant former MGM soundstage, where \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and countless other productions originated, bought by Amazon and tricked out with the latest gadgetry.\n\u201cIt is traditional in the sense that you have a traditionalist in Brian Williams,\u201d Wald said. \u201cBut everything else about it, from where it is on and how we are presenting things, is new.\u201d\nWald promises a broadcast that he says will seem more streamlined, less cluttered, than its rivals. A typical news division often brings everyone it has available into its election night coverage, and often it feels that way.\nEven before this event, Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos has played a role in the election. Also the owner of The Washington Post, Bezos was instrumental in the newspaper's decision announced Friday not to endorse either Harris or Trump, causing an uprising among many at the newspaper.\nWilliams comes forward after keeping a low profile\nWilliams anchored \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d then the top-rated evening newscast, from 2004 to 2015, losing that job after embellishing his role in war coverage. Given a second chance, he hosted \u201cThe 11th Hour\u201d on MSNBC from 2016 until signing off in December 2021.\nHe's kept a low profile ever since, enjoying a grandson born just days before leaving MSNBC, and volunteer firefighting down at the Jersey Shore until Amazon came calling.\n\u201cThis is the first thing that really made my toe tap,\u201d he said. \u201cThis got some old competitive juices flowing \u2014 emphasis on old. It is a weird place to be because you know me well enough to know there was no more bullish broadcaster than I was. I completely believed in over-the-air broadcast news, and cable.\u201d\nYet every television executive he's talked to tells him that streaming represents the future, if not the present. \u201cThis feels like a chance to get on a train that is leaving the station,\u201d said Williams, who spoke by phone Sunday from an airport in Los Angeles.\nThe election night newscast will begin at 5 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 5. It will be available for free to anyone with a device who logs on to amazon.com: no subscription or log-on will be necessary.\nWilliams is prepared for the possibility that the ultimate mystery \u2014 who\u2019s going to be the next president \u2014 will not be known by the time he has to sign off. That will probably be about 10 hours after he starts give or take some time. \u201cA lot of of good energy drinks have come out in the last couple of years,\u201d he joked.\nWilliams said he has no idea what this means for himself, or Amazon, after Nov. 5.\n\u201cIt's a big undertaking and they're taking a big swing with this,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is my part in it, and that's one night. I don't know if we're going to look back on this as a first for Amazon or as an experiment for Amazon. I don't know. That's up to them.\u201d\n___\nDavid Bauder writes about media for the AP.

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nKey Factors to Influence Amazon\u2019s Q3 Results\nPrime Ecosystem Leads Multi-Channel Expansion\nIn the third quarter, Amazon's growth trajectory is expected to have been anchored by its comprehensive Prime ecosystem, which continues to evolve across multiple revenue streams. The e-commerce giant's robust delivery infrastructure, particularly its Prime Free One Day and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery services, remains a cornerstone of its retail dominance, setting new standards for consumer convenience.\n\nThe company's strategic expansion in the grocery sector, coupled with its strengthening distribution network, has positioned it favorably in the competitive retail landscape. This growth is further amplified by Amazon's global e-commerce operations and the international expansion of Prime membership benefits. A notable development is the company's emerging presence in the pharmaceutical sector, where its innovative RxPass program offers Prime members a simplified medication delivery service for a flat monthly fee of $5.\n\nPhysical retail operations are expected to show healthy growth, with consensus estimates projecting physical store sales of $5.15 billion, representing a 4% year-over-year increase. The integration of advanced technology, such as the Amazon Dash Cart, into its brick-and-mortar locations demonstrates the company's commitment to enhancing in-store shopping experiences. Additionally, the expansion of Amazon Fresh grocery stores, Whole Foods locations and Amazon Go outlets continues to strengthen the company's omnichannel presence.\n\nThird-party seller partnerships remain a significant growth driver, with consensus estimates for sales pegged at $38.07 billion, indicating a robust 10.9% increase from the previous year. The streaming segment, led by Prime Video, continues to gain momentum through expanded original content offerings and portfolio diversification. The addition of ad-free Amazon Music as part of Prime membership further enhances the subscription's value proposition.\n\nThese combined initiatives are expected to positively impact subscription revenues, with consensus estimates forecasting subscription service sales of $11.13 billion, indicating 9.4% growth compared to the previous year. This comprehensive ecosystem approach, integrating retail, healthcare, entertainment, and digital services under the Prime umbrella, appears to be effectively driving Amazon's continued market expansion and revenue growth.\nStory Continues\nAWS Boosts AI Innovation and Infrastructure Expansion\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has been strengthening its market position through strategic investments in generative AI and infrastructure expansion. The cloud segment's growth has been primarily driven by the successful adoption of Amazon Bedrock, marking a significant advancement in generative AI capabilities.\n\nThe expansion of AWS' global footprint through additional regions and availability zones enhances its service accessibility and reliability. These strategic initiatives are reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWS sales of $27.5 billion, implying a substantial 19.5% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe combination of cutting-edge AI technology and robust cloud infrastructure positioned AWS as a key driver of Amazon's overall growth momentum in the quarter under review.\nSmart Device Portfolio Worth Considering\nAmazon\u2019s robust Fire products family, portfolio of Echo smart speakers, Blink smart security cameras and doorbells, and eero WiFi systems are expected to have continued benefiting its financial performance in the third quarter.\n\nStrengthening Alexa features are likely to have aided Amazon in delivering a better user experience, the impacts of which, in turn, are expected to get reflected in the upcoming results.\nPrice Performance & Valuation\nAmazon\u2019s shares have appreciated 23.6% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the broader Zacks\u00a0 Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500 index\u2019s rise of 19% and 21.9%, respectively. Shares of Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL have gained 13.9% and 18.3%, respectively.\nAMZN Outperforms Sector, Peers\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value Amazon offers investors at current levels. AMZN is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 2.86X compared with the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry\u2019s 1.7X and higher than the median of 2.8X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nAMZN\u2019s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Thesis\nAmazon presents a compelling investment thesis driven by dual growth engines. The core retail business demonstrates strong momentum through Prime ecosystem expansion, enhanced delivery capabilities and omnichannel optimization, while AWS maintains its cloud leadership through strategic AI integration and infrastructure scaling. The company's revenue diversification across e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming and healthcare services provides multiple growth vectors. With retail projecting solid growth in third-party sales and physical stores, alongside AWS' estimated 19.5% revenue growth to $27.5 billion, Amazon appears well-positioned to deliver sustained financial performance. The integration of generative AI across segments further strengthens its competitive moat and long-term growth potential.\nFinal Thoughts\nAmazon\u2019s near and long-term prospects are expected to benefit from strong retail strategies, which include bolstering its online and offline retail presence, distribution channels and delivery services. An expanding global presence and the growing adoption of Prime are other tailwinds. The growing footprint in the video streaming space with Prime Video is another positive. Solid AWS momentum, coupled with a deepening focus on generative AI, is a plus. It is helping Amazon maintain its dominant cloud position. Maintaining a position in Amazon appears prudent at present. Investors looking to buy the stock should, however, wait for a better entry point, as a stretched valuation might be perceived as a risk.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenues are forecasted to be $157 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 9.7%.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone an upward revision of 0.2% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Amazon metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net Sales- AWS' of $27.56 billion.

The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +17.6%.\nAnalysts forecast 'Net Sales- Third-party seller services' to reach $38.08 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +10.9% year over year.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Net Sales- International' will reach $34.01 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.8% from the prior-year quarter.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Subscription services Y/Y Change' will reach 9.3%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 13%.\nStory Continues\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Online stores Y/Y Change' will reach 3.8%. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 6% in the same quarter last year.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Third-party seller services Y/Y Change' will likely reach 10.9%. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 18% in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Headcount - Total' at 1,532,649. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 1,500,000 in the same quarter of the previous year.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'WW shipping costs' reaching $23.94 billion.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of BofA\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stocks with The Fastest Projected EPS Growth Rates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best BofA's top growth stocks with the fastest projected EPS growth rates.\nFor the stock market, if there\u2019s one thing that can be said with some certainty, it\u2019s that earnings and revenue growth drives share price performance. This is because a firm\u2019s stock price is a reflection of investor estimates of its future market potential. Firms that are believed to gain market share in the future often see their share price surge in the present as investors tailor their portfolios to try to get an early position in some of the biggest names of tomorrow.\nIn fact, we don\u2019t have to dig too deep to see this principle in action. The clearest example of it is in the stock of the AI chips company that\u2019s Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI stock so far. Its stock is up 199% year to date, 235% over the past twelve months, and 887% since the start of 2023. While all these returns are something that most\u2013if not all\u2013company executives would give an arm and a leg for, to see our principle in action, we\u2019ll have to dig deeper into the 887% share price gain.\nNarrowing down our analysis to this stock\u2019s performance in 2023\u2013from the start and to the end of the year\u2013its shares gained 239%. During the first half, they gained 189.5% and during Q1, the stock was up 90%. So, the shares\u2019 performance in Q2 has proven crucial as the starting point of a rally that has so far yielded an 887% share price appreciation. During Q2, the stock was up 52%, driven by the fact that on May 24th, 2023 (during the Q1FY24 earnings), the firm\u2019s CEO stunned investors when he shared that \u201cA trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.\u201d\nThis meant that CEO Jensen Huang believed that in the future, businesses would spend as much as $1 trillion on his company\u2019s products. Investors were ecstatic and they piled into the company to send its shares soaring by 24.6% between May 19th and May 26th. In this company\u2019s case, the CEO\u2019s optimism was also met by cold, hard results. During the same Q1, the firm\u2019s data center business division revenue jumped by 14% annually, in a sign that foretold the growth story of the next quarters. Mind you, this fiscal Q1 was only the second quarter following OpenAI\u2019s public ChatGPT release, so the AI wave that solidified in Q4 2024 was in its infancy.\nStory Continues\nThese hard results saw the firm annually grow its revenue by 101%, 206%, 265%, 262%, and 122% in its Q2FY24, Q3FY24, Q4FY24, Q1FY25, and Q2FY25, respectively. The top line growth has been accompanied by bottom line profits also jumping by triple digit percentages in all of the quarters. The highest reading was for Q2FY24 when its non-GAAP net income jumped by 843% year-over-year.\nThus, it\u2019s safe to say that growth is rewarded by the stock market. Yet, the high investor expectations for growth stocks also mean that they are punished harder in case they fail to meet expectations. Research from the University of Michigan analyzed data for 13 years covering consensus earnings forecasts, quarterly earnings, stock prices, market to book ratio, and price to earnings ratio to check whether growth and value stocks perform similarly if they fail to meet earnings expectations.\nTheir results\u00a0show\u00a0that growth stocks tend to fall more than value stocks when it comes to negative earnings surprises. The researchers add that the underperformance is typically before the earnings are announced since growth stocks typically preannounce their negative earnings surprise. A descriptive analysis of their data also shows that cumulative stock returns for the days between two earnings cycles are higher for low growth stocks over high growth stocks. For the lowest growth stocks, the cumulative returns for all firms analyzed were 0.66%, while those for firms with negative and positive earnings surprises were -3.57% and 5.44%, respectively. For the high growth stocks, cumulative returns for all firms were -0.58%, and the returns for those with negative and positive earnings surprises were -7.32% and 6.32%, respectively.\nThe research concisely sums up the potential of investing in growth stocks and the accompanying risks. Returning to our GPU designer, while right now it\u2019s at the center of the AI buzz, back in 2017 and 2018, it was at the center of the Bitcoin rush since gaming GPUs could also be used to mine cryptocurrencies. However, between mid-December 2017 and mid-December 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped by 83%. For the firm\u2019s quarter that ended in January 2019, this led to its gaming GPU revenue dropping by 45% year-over-year and 46% sequentially. This was because the crypto sector had over ordered GPUs, but as Bitcoin prices fell, mining became unprofitable and the over-ordering led to a glut in the market. Looking at the firm\u2019s post split stock price, this led to the stock falling by 53% between October and the end of December 2018.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of BofA\u2019s top growth stock picks, we used the bank\u2019s latest list of stocks that are rated Buy, have an EPS surprise rating, and the highest projected growth rates for the next five years. The stocks were ranked by their projected EPS growth rates.\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 103\nProjected EPS Growth Rate: 34.4%\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the biggest media streaming company in the world. With 282.7 million subscribers under its belt as of September 2024. Its reliance on subscribers means that it has to focus on customer retention and user monetization to drive its share price higher. Consequently, it was unsurprising that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s stock rose 4.45% after the firm\u2019s third quarter of 2024 earnings saw it add 5.1 million subscribers and beat analyst estimates by more than a million. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also delivered on the revenue and earnings front, with its $9.93 billion revenue and $5.40 in EPS beating analyst estimates of $9.77 billion and $5.12. However, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s Q3 subscriber additions were lower than the year ago quarter\u2019s 8.76 million, and with management now set to discontinue sharing subscriber count, investor sentiment will depend on Netflix, Inc.

Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cThe rapid recovery of Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth has shocked investors who drove the stock down to a price of just $166 in May 2022. While at the time, bearish investors were declaring the company\u2019s growth days were behind it, instead the company added a remarkable 13.1 million new subscribers in the most recent quarter. This was the single largest quarterly subscriber addition other than the large gains experienced during the first quarter of COVID. For all of 2023, the company added nearly 30 million new subscribers, making it the largest annual gain in Netflix history other than the first year of COVID.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 6th on our list of best BofA's top growth stocks with the fastest projected EPS growth rates. NFLX is one of the top stocks with the highest consensus earnings growth according to BofA. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nNetflix (NFLX) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this internet video service a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Netflix is 25.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 64.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 17.5%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Netflix is 5.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.9%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 17.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 1.7%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Netflix have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.6% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNetflix has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Netflix is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to figures from Ofcom, 68pc of UK households reported using a streaming service in the first three months of 2024, up from 66pc in 2023.\nThe most popular services were Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, with Netflix remaining the most watched, averaging 21 minutes per person per day in 2023.\nHere, Telegraph Money takes a look at what each of the major TV streaming platforms offer, along with tips on how you can cut costs without sacrificing the films and TV shows you want to watch.\nNetflix\nNetflix, which began as a DVD postal service, launched its groundbreaking streaming service in 2007 and by 2010 it was available on most devices.\nIt now creates enormous amounts of original content, such as the shows Bridgerton, The Crown and Baby Reindeer, and films including Scoop and Academy Award winner All Quiet On The Western Front.\nPreviously the streaming service had a large library of older content, although this has been eroded by other content producers launching their own platforms.\nSubscription numbers dropped after its 2022 announcement that it would be cracking down on password sharing, but the platform also added a cheaper membership option \u2013 which comes with ad breaks. Its viewing figures have since recovered, and its latest count of paying viewers topped 282.7 million globally.\nUK customers now have to pay an extra \u00a34.99 per month on top of their existing subscription to share their account outside their home.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a34.99 for a standard account with adverts for two devices; \u00a310.99 for standard account for two devices (extra member slots outside your household can be added for \u00a34.99); \u00a315.99 for premium account for four devices (extra member slots can be added for \u00a34.99). All charges are monthly.\nCan you share your password? Not any more. Netflix wrote to users in May 2023 to inform them they could no longer share accounts with people outside of their household. However, those signed up for a standard or premium account can purchase extra member slots for people who don\u2019t live with them for \u00a34.99 a month.\nStory continues\nAmazon Prime\nThe Amazon Prime Video platform is just one part of the Prime subscription, which also offers services like Prime Reading and free delivery on qualifying Amazon orders. Like Netflix, it has a number of original films and TV shows, with big hitters including Clarkson\u2019s Farm, The Grand Tour and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\nAmazon also has the rights to show 20 matches of Premier League fixtures over the course of a season. Both rounds for this season have already been shown, and it will not have the rights from the 2025-26 season onwards.\nThe streaming service recently launched ads, meaning your content will be interrupted by regular adverts unless you pay an extra \u00a32.99 each month.\nCustomers can get a one-month free trial before the paid subscription kicks in, while students can get a free six-month trial.\nIf you don\u2019t want free delivery or any of the other Prime services, you can get a cheaper Prime Video subscription, which is just for the streaming service.\nNote that you can end up paying extra to rent or buy titles that aren\u2019t part of the free Prime viewing offer. Look out for the Amazon Prime banner, which indicates the free things you can watch, or check out the \u201cFree to me\u201d section. Some shows, such as Neighbours, are free with adverts on Amazon\u2019s Freevee service.\nIt is possible to link Amazon accounts with another adult in your household and up to two children in order to share Prime benefits, including Prime Video, meaning only one subscription per household is needed.\nAmazon has not announced a password crackdown, so even if you don\u2019t link accounts, you should be able to share the Prime Video benefits with friends and family.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a35.99 per month for Prime Video only; \u00a38.99 per month or \u00a395 per year (\u00a312.88 cheaper); for students it\u2019s \u00a34.49 per month or \u00a347.49 per year (\u00a36.39 cheaper). It costs \u00a32.99 extra each month to watch ad-free.\nCan you share your password? You can share your Prime membership with someone else in your household, meaning you can both also get perks like free deliveries. There\u2019s no mechanism in place to strictly prohibit password sharing with other people, but be aware they may be able to access the rest of your Amazon account.\nDisney+\nWith more than 153 million subscribers as of August 2024, Disney+ has caused a real stir in the streaming market since it launched in the UK in March 2020.\nOriginally designed to be the home of all much-loved children\u2019s Disney content, the platform has expanded with its Star Wars and Marvel content. It also hosts a number of series popular with adults, such as Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Modern Family and exclusive content such as Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals.\nIts popularity with older generations has increased, with subscribers aged over-64 rising from 7pc in 2022 to 12pc in 2023, according to Ofcom.\nUsers can access Disney\u2019s entire back catalogue from its 80-year history, and the service also has exclusive streaming of new Disney films \u2013 though if you want these new films early it can cost around \u00a319.99 extra, on top of your subscription.\nIn November 2023 Disney announced an ad-supported subscription plan for \u00a34.99.\nIt has also cracked down on password sharing, with the possibility of being blocked from the streaming service if it detects that the account is shared with people who don\u2019t live at the primary residence.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a34.99 per month for a standard account with adverts for two devices; \u00a38.99 a month or \u00a389.90 a year (\u00a317.98 cheaper) for a standard account for two devices; \u00a312.99 per month or \u00a3129.90 per year (\u00a325.98 cheaper) for a premium account for four devices. Since it cracked down on password sharing, you can add an extra member, not in your household, for \u00a33.99 per month with ads, or \u00a34.99 per month without ads.\nCan you share your password? As of September 2024 you can no longer share a Disney+ account with someone outside of your household. Its customer support defines a household as \u201cthe collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside therein.\u201d\nIf you want to share your account outside of your household, you have to pay \u00a33.99 per month to add an extra member, or \u00a34.99 per month for ad-free viewing.\nNOW TV\nLaunched in 2012, NOW is Sky\u2019s on-demand streaming service, and is the place to go for many blockbusters and fan-favourite shows such as Game Of Thrones and Succession.\nArguably the most customisable service out there, you can get \u201cpasses\u201d for the specific kinds of things you want to watch \u2013 the Entertainment Pass covers Sky TV series and box sets, as well as children\u2019s shows, and a Sport Pass lets you watch everything on Sky Sports, while a Hayu Pass allows you watch reality TV shows such as Real Housewives and Below Deck at the same time it\u2019s released in America, putting an end to spoilers.\nIn addition, you can choose how long you want to sign up for. Most passes come with a rolling monthly option, but the Sports Pass, for example, has a day pass option where you spend \u00a314.99 for 24-hour access to 12 live Sky Sports channels \u2013 ideal if there\u2019s just one particular match you want to watch.\nHowever, it can get expensive if you want access to all of the channels.\nWith the standard subscription for an Entertainment or Cinema Pass you can only stream on one device at a time, and will have to watch ads. You can add on a Boost subscription for \u00a36 per month to watch on two devices and watch ad-free, or Ultra Boost for \u00a39 which allows three devices and ad-free viewing.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a39.99 a month for Entertainment Pass or Cinema Pass; \u00a334.99 a month for Sport Pass; \u00a34.99 a month for Hayu Pass (for reality TV).\nCan you share your password? There\u2019s nothing strictly prohibiting password sharing, but you may come a cropper as only a limited number of streams can take place at the same time. To get three simultaneous streams, you need to sign up to the Boost service, which costs an extra \u00a39 a month after a seven-day free period.\nApple TV+\nWhile Apple TV+ was once one of the best value streaming services on the market, its \u00a36.99 monthly price has since risen to \u00a38.99, putting it broadly in-line with several other services.\nThe streaming service, which is free for three months to those who buy new Apple products, has however received criticism for its relatively small library, but the shows are Apple TV+ originals.\nAmong its big hitters are football-comedy-with-feelings Ted Lasso, and The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Anniston and Reese Witherspoon. Watching anything on Apple TV+ is ad-free.\nIn an Oscars upset, the streaming service became the first to win a Best Picture award for CODA, a heart-warming indie drama, beating offerings from the likes of Netflix.\nUp to five family members can be added to the subscription and the main account holder can stop others from making extra purchases via your Apple account \u2013 perfect for stopping small children overspending on your card.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a38.99 a month after a seven-day free trial.\nCan you share your password? You\u2019re encouraged to share your Apple TV+ account with up to five family members in your household. It\u2019s possible to share with people outside of your household, but you\u2019ll want to be extra careful about making sure the extra purchase option is turned off.\nParamount+\nLaunched in the UK in 2022, Paramount+ is vying to compete with the streaming mainstays of Amazon and Netflix.\nIt has a large catalogue of content \u2013 ranging from original shows, to programmes from channels like MTV and Comedy Central. It has also branched into Star Trek spin-off shows, and rebooted the US comedy Frasier.\nParamount\u2019s collection of films is also quite substantial, including 90s classics Titanic and Clueless, as well as more recent releases such as the Mean Girls musical.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a36.99 a month, or \u00a369.90 a year. It comes with a seven-day free trial. Sky Cinema subscribers can use the streaming service for free.\nCan you share your password?\u00a0Six profiles can be created with your account, so theoretically, you can share your account with five other people. Only two devices can be in use at once, so two people can watch Paramount+ at the same time from the same account.\nFree options and other ways to save\nIf you want to maintain access to the various streaming services, there are a few ways you can cut your costs.\nConsider rotating your subscriptions\nIf you\u2019re paying monthly, it can make sense to pause or cancel your account whenever you\u2019re not using it. For example, if you\u2019re signed up to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, you could pause two accounts while you focus on watching things on Netflix, the next month pause Netflix and focus on Disney+, and so on.\nShare whenever you can\nEven if you can\u2019t share your passwords \u2013 or don\u2019t want to \u2013 at least make sure there aren\u2019t multiple accounts being paid for within your household. Each service usually comes with more than enough available profiles for everyone to maintain their own list of things they\u2019re watching, and recommendations for further viewing. It\u2019s also possible to add parental controls to children\u2019s profiles, ensuring they can only view age-appropriate content.\nUse free trials\nMost streaming services offer free trials, of varying lengths. Getting three months of free Apple TV+, for example, is more than enough time to get through a couple of its best series \u2013 after which time you can simply cancel your subscription.\nCheck for bundles\nIn some cases, you can get a streaming service thrown in with certain mobile phone bundles \u2013 so make sure you\u2019re not paying for something you could be getting for free.\nFor example, Vodafone phone and SIM only customers can get its entertainment plan, which includes membership to YouTube Premium or Amazon Prime. Some Sky packages also come with Netflix thrown in; currently, you can get Sky Stream with Netflix (standard with ads) for \u00a328 per month for 24 months.\nOpt for free streaming\nWhile you will need a TV licence to watch BBC iPlayer and any live shows on other catch-up services, viewers can stream ITV X, My 5, and Channel 4 for free.\nAlternatively, Internet Archive, a free digital library, offers a large collection of films that are in the public domain \u2013 but don\u2019t expect to find the latest blockbusters. Top Documentary Films is a site perfect for when you want to learn something, offering thousands of insightful documentaries."

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX).\nNetflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.5% and 5% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NFLX\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Netflix, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs NFLX Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.6% over the past month to $19.78.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Netflix may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "The tech rally has been helping the broader market this year. Although markets have been volatile over the past couple of weeks, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has been making a steady climb. On Oct. 25, the Nasdaq hit an all-time high, led by mega-cap stocks ahead of their upcoming earnings and the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).\nGiven the ongoing tech rally and expectations of more rate cuts this year, it would be ideal to invest in Nasdaq stocks such as Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW, whichhave strong potential for the near term. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNasdaq Hits Record High\nOn Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.6% to close at an all-time high of 18,518.61 points. The index also closed 0.2% higher for the week, recording its seventh straight week of gains, its longest winning streak for 2024.\nYear to date, the Nasdaq Composite has gained 23.4% after soaring 43.4% in 2023, recording its best year since 2020.\nTech stocks rallied last year after a lackluster 2022 when rising interest rates negatively impacted growth stocks. The rally has since continued and gathered steam this year, boosting the Nasdaq. The current rally is largely being fueled by stocks focused on artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, which is also helping the broader market.\nAI Enthusiasm Powering Tech Rally\nWhile AI experts' opinions, particularly on the future of generative AI, are divided, the optimism surrounding this field has been enormous over the past year. Many believe that AI is still in its early stages and that its full potential has yet to be tapped. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been a frontrunner in generative AI and has been pivotal in the surge in interest in this field. Its shares have soared 185.8% year to date.\nNVIDIA\u2019s solid progress in the generative AI space has seen several tech giants trying to leave a prominent footprint in that area. Also, the advancement of smart devices is supporting the field as they require computing and learning abilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analytics. These functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, which are all favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry.\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a strong recovery as a result, following a period of challenges until the first half of 2022.\nStory Continues\nAlso, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first since March 2020. This has been further aiding growth assets, especially tech stocks. Low interest rates typically have a positive impact on growth assets. Market participants are now expecting two more interest rate cuts of 25 basis points each this year, which should further help tech stocks.\n4 Nasdaq Stocks With Upside\nAlphabet Inc.\nAlphabet Inc. is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, GOOGL has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others.\nAlphabet\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 31.9%.

The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks \u2014 Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet.\nThe debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines.\nThat\u2019s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals.\nFreedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on \u201chopes and dreams\u201d than fundamentals.\n\u201cTesla had its moment in the sun \u2026 to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,\u201d Woods warned on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief.\nWhile CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm\u2019s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business \u2014 a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers.\n\u201cI've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen \u2026 We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,\u201d longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me.\nTesla\u2019s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group.\n\u2022 USD\n(TSLA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAs of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts.\nAs far as Tesla\u2019s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender.\nWealth Enhancement Group\u2019s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix \u201cmakes the most sense,\u201d as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance.\nStory Continues\nSince the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nPortfolio Wealth Advisors\u2019 Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a \u201ccash flow machine,\" and Netflix \u201cfits the bill.\u201d\n\u201cNetflix\u2019s free cash flow has been relentless \u2026 Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,\u201d Alvarado added.\nThe streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022.\nBank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix\u2019s growing free cash flow as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nAs of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock.\nWhile Tesla\u2019s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix\u2019s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.\nSeana's week ahead checklist\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nThe earnings avalanche has commenced.\nAnd what does that mean?\nYou've probably missed a lot of other stories that could impact your portfolio. After all, there's more to one's investing life than modeling out 2050 profits for Nvidia (NVDA) and wondering whether Tesla (TSLA) will haul in $10 billion in sales from humanoid robots.\nIn the spirit of this, here are a couple of convos I had this week that may leave you thinking (hopefully).\nAI meets extra spicy hot sauce: I was at a CEO dinner this week where an analyst specializing in AI proceeded to share the deep impact to businesses as AI proliferates. I tend to agree the way business is done will change profoundly, and it'll include a good bit of job loss.\nAn example of AI's impact is in Cholula hot sauce. Its parent, spice maker McCormick (MKC), held an investor day this week.\n\"We have used generative AI to really understand where all the commentary was going [for hot sauce], we learned there were some Cholula lovers out there that wanted a hotter version. So in January, we are launching an extra-hot version of Cholula,\" McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination Overtime.\nMcCormick reiterated its long-term sales growth guidance of 4% to 6% and earnings growth of 9% to 11%. Shares are up 16% year to date compared to the 22% gain for the S&P 500.\nYou can catch that full spicy segment here.\nBuilding a 21st-century media company: The traditional media industry continues to be disrupted by everything from new streaming networks to creators posting on YouTube. Why else do you think Disney (DIS) said this week its CEO Bob Iger was sticking around until 2026 (he was rumored to be leaving in 2025)? He has to leave the business in a much better place than his last exit.\nOne of these disrupters in the past 15 years has been Dude Perfect. The company was started by five friends who went to Texas A&M and rose to fame for viral trick-shot videos posted on YouTube. The company now boasts 60.5 million subscribers and churns out a steady, broader array of content.\nArmed with a new $100 million capital infusion from Highmount Capital, Dude Perfect is gearing up for more unique programming and the build-out of a headquarters in Frisco, Texas. In charge of bringing that vision to life? Dude Perfect's first-ever CEO Andrew Yaffe, who took the job several weeks ago.\nStory Continues\n\"I think people underestimate how big YouTube is,\" Yaffe told me of the Google-owned (GOOG) platform on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here). \"YouTube is the biggest media platform in the US in terms of consumption. Bigger than Netflix (NFLX). And that's growing quickly. It's also the biggest outside the US. It's massive \u2014 it is how people under the age of 34 consume content.\"\nNot massive: Google's stock price year to date. Shares have lagged the S&P 500's 23% gain, rising only 16%.\nListen to more episodes of Opening Bid\nWhy leaders should think about DEI differently this presidential election season\nNvidia stock is still undervalued, BofA analyst argues\nFormer Trump adviser Judy Shelton: Elon Musk is right on the government efficiency front\nBig Blue is a big AI player: So much gets lost on a company's earnings day as traders zoom in on the numbers and a couple of trends on the earnings call. Ultimately this is why I think companies should be reporting twice a year, but that's a discussion for a different day.\nOne number that got lost in IBM's earnings release Wednesday (which led to a shellacking in the stock price as consulting sales missed estimates): $3 billion of AI-related project backing. IBM's veteran CFO Jim Kavanaugh tells me the company is tracking toward adding $1 billion in AI project backlog a quarter.\nThat's huge and aligns with what Kavanaugh thinks is a long runway for AI infrastructure buildout.\n\"In my personal opinion, I think it's going to be the longest [adoption] curve that we'll see also because it'll play in many different industries and many different clients,\" Kavanaugh said.\nThat bullish sentiment was echoed in a convo I had on Opening Bid with BofA analyst Vivek Arya this week, where he went into how AI's buildout will require the use of nuclear power. More insight on that and how it will benefit market darling Nvidia here.\nOur Morning Brief anchor Seana Smith will be diving into IBM's AI future with chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna at our annual Invest conference on Nov. 12.

Marriott, 50, who assumed the chairman role at Marriott (MAR) from his legendary father J.W. \"Bill\" Marriott, Jr., 92, in 2022. David's father \u2014 who is chairman emeritus \u2014 served as chairman for 60 years and CEO for 40 years. Mind-blowing! Bill's parents, Alice Marriott and J. Willard Marriott, founded the company as an A&W root beer stand in 1927.\nSuffice it to say, the younger Marriott hardly does interviews (he travels a lot and has four children) \u2014 so it was a treat to spend time with him on Opening Bid.\n\"I spent several summers doing internships in the kitchen, learning how to prep food, hot food, cold food, and learning how to cook on the line. And, I spent a summer as a bellman and spent some time making beds and working behind the front desk,\" Marriott told me of his on-the-job training.\nThe full pod drop of our chat is at 8:30 a.m. ET on Monday. Be sure to tune in on Yahoo Finance or listen in on your podcast platform of choice.\nAnd since you were wondering: Shares of Marriott are up 111% in the last five years.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Netflix's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n51% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders\nInsiders have sold recently\nIf you want to know who really controls Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nAnd as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 9.7% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 87%.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Netflix.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Netflix\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Netflix?\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nNetflix already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Netflix's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Netflix. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nStory Continues\nInsider Ownership Of Netflix\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur information suggests that Netflix, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.9b worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nNext Steps:\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Netflix better, we need to consider many other factors.\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The company reported revenue growth of 2.8% QoQ and 15% YoY, with revenue beating estimates by $57 million. GAAP EPS also exceeded expectations at $5.40, while subscriber numbers surged to 282.7 million, outpacing estimates by 4 million. The net income margin reached an impressive 24.1%, up 450 basis points compared to the same quarter last year, signaling operational efficiency despite competitive pressures.\nDespite facing stiff competition from peers like Disney and Amazon Prime, Netflix\u2019s Q3 results have displayed its ability to maintain its competitive edge. Netflix's strategy of expanding beyond traditional streaming, into areas like live events, gaming, advertising, and international markets, has broadened its total addressable market. The platform's ability to secure high-profile events, such as the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match and NFL games, exemplifies its ability to capture large, engaged audiences.\nNetflix\u2019s approach to flexible pricing models has also been key to sustaining growth. In some regions, such as Japan, the U.S., and Spain, prices have been raised, while in other markets, the company has introduced lower-priced, ad-supported plans. These ad-supported tiers now account for over 50% of new sign-ups, offering a solution for price-sensitive consumers while allowing Netflix to monetize a broader audience. However, the introduction of ad-supported plans also reflects underlying consumer weakness, highlighting the company's need to balance affordability with profitability.\nThe ad platform, still in its early stages, offers significant long-term potential. Despite growing competition in the digital advertising space, Netflix's unmatched audience engagement provides a unique value proposition to advertisers. As companies increasingly invest in digital ads, Netflix stands out by offering premium placements in highly anticipated content, positioning itself as a future leader in this lucrative market. With strong user engagement, the company can command high CPMs, giving it a competitive edge over other platforms.\nStory Continues\nInternational expansion remains another key opportunity for Netflix. Revenue growth of 16% YoY in both the U.S. and Canada and EMEA markets, alongside 19% growth in Asia Pacific and 9% in LATAM, demonstrates Netflix's ability to scale globally, although volatility remains in emerging markets.\nBasically, the bullish thesis on Netflix stems from the fact that the company is diversifying its revenue streams and expanding its total addressable market (TAM).

(AP Photo/Alastair Grant) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIndustry watchers also anticipate an expansion of Google's cloud business, an increasingly important segment to investors because of its use in the development of artificial intelligence. Wall Street projects Google Cloud revenue to register nearly $11 billion, boasting a roughly 28% increase from the same period last year.\n\u201cWe think GOOGL has the best cloud infrastructure for the AI era and, as a result, should allow it to better manage its cost profile compared to other cloud providers, while also benefiting from a host of new revenue opportunities,\u201d said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA Research, in a note.\nAlphabet's report arrives during a turbulent moment for the company.\nEarlier this month, the US Justice Department said in court filing that it may recommend a break-up of the company to boost competition in the search engine market. The DOJ is expected to provide a more detailed document by Nov. 20 outlining their proposed remedies.\nStory Continues\nMegacap earnings fall just a week before the tight contest between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, adding another element of unpredictability.\nAlphabet falls in the bottom half when it comes to \"Magnificent Seven\" stock performance, gaining 20% so far this year \u2014 well below Meta's (META) and Nvidia's (NVDA) spectacular climbs, but ahead of Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft's (MSFT) respective gains of 14% and 10%.\nSome analysts who are bullish on the stock see its relative affordability as an attractive feature.\n\u201cWhile we don't view the upcoming quarterly report as a likely catalyst for Alphabet, we do think shares are attractive at current levels with shares trading below the market multiple,\u201d said Wedbush analysts in a preview note.\n\u201cWe think there is a case for multiple expansion for Alphabet in the coming quarters and years as investors gain more comfort related to regulatory risk and the impact of generative AI on Google Search.\u201d\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

This company went on to become the largest in the world before declining, but it is on another rally that could make it the biggest company yet again. Very few people would've thought that such a thing would be possible even just a year ago.\nThat said, the stock market is--and always will be--a weighing machine in the long run. The bulls may have been right so far, but that does not mean that Nvidia will keep its shine forever. No stock in history has defied gravity for years and years without a major correction of some sort. Conversely, the bearish argument here is taking a very long time to play out. There's competition on the horizon, but the numbers coming out of Nvidia's quarterly reports are simply too high for the market to not reward.\nAnyone telling you with absolute certainty about where this train is heading is lying. However, what we can do is dig deeper and see what can go right and what can go wrong. You can then form your own opinion--with a lot more confidence. Let's start!\nDoes Nvidia's AI Business Have Any Real Competition?\nWe're going to assume that you already have a decent idea of what Nvidia does. On that note, we're going to jump into the most important part of Nvidia's business: Compute & Networking.\nCompute & Networking is Nvidia's largest and fastest-growing segment. It generated $22.68 billion in revenues in Q1 fiscal 2025, up by an extraordinary 5.1X year-on-year. The segment further accelerated in Q2 fiscal 2025 and reached $26.3 billion in revenue. This marked a 16% sequential increase and a staggering 154% year-over-year growth.\nThe success here stems from Nvidia's flagship H100 data center GPUs. These GPUs are poised to get even better with the upcoming H200 and Blackwell B200 architectures. Speaking of Blackwell, it claims to deliver up to 30 times greater inference performance and consume 25 times less energy for massive AI models compared to its predecessors.\nNow let's see what the competition has to offer.\nThe underdogs AMD and Intel are making significant strides against Nvidia. However, they're more focused on trying to undercut Nvidia's chips instead of trying to outperform them. AMD's Instinct MI300X chip focuses on inference workloads and Intel's Gaudi 3 accelerator is positioning itself as a more cost-effective alternative.\nAI hardware isn't the only thing Nvidia is working on, though. Nvidia's competitive moat extends beyond hardware. Its CUDA software platform has become the industry standard, creating what CEO Jensen Huang calls a \"virtuous circle.\" The company is expanding its ecosystem with new products like Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software.\nStory Continues\nMoreover, Nvidia's networking arm--which reported revenue of $3.2 billion in Q1 fiscal 2025 (a 242% year-over-year increase)--is becoming increasingly important. Nvidia's Spectrum-X product line is expected to become a multibillion-dollar business within a year. In Q2, its Networking revenue hit $3.7 billion, up 114% year-over-year.\nThe Growth Potential Going Forward\nNvidia is clearly miles ahead of the competition so far. There's no denying it. That said, being overkill does have its own drawbacks. There's no guarantee that the broader AI industry will grow in a way that would let Nvidia continue to post such insane growth figures. It's a good idea that we look into the growth potential here more closely.\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global artificial intelligence market is projected to grow from $621.19 billion in 2024 to $2,740.46 billion by 2032. This is at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.4%.\nLooking specifically at Nvidia, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya believes that Nvidia can capture a significant portion of the AI market. He estimates that with Nvidia maintaining its market share, this translates to $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. For reference, Nvidia's total revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $61 billion.\nHowever, not all analysts are quite as bullish. The consensus among analysts suggests that Nvidia will generate roughly $1.29 trillion in cumulative revenue between fiscal years 2025 and 2030. While still an impressive figure, it falls short of the most optimistic projections.\nHow could this play out? Well, let's take a look.\nAll of these are based on what analysts estimate right now. We could dig into each of these estimates separately, but that would take us outside the scope of this article. Here are what the estimates for its Data Center/AI segment look like for the next two years.\nNvidia's growth going forward clearly has a lot of variability but should remain fast-moving in the near term unless competition really starts to ramp up.\nLet's dig deeper into the catalysts that could drag growth into the lower end of the estimates we've presented.\nMacroeconomic factors can throw a wrench into those estimates. Plus, there's no knowing if AI hype will continue to hold steady. AI startups are flush with cash due to enthusiastic funding rounds from venture capitalists. However, they can get impatient fast if profitability does not improve in the coming years.\nAnother catalyst that is quite under-mentioned is the reliance of Nvidia on a few key customers. This level of customer concentration is considered \"highly unusual\" for a company of Nvidia's size. Most other mega-cap companies don't have even a single customer accounting for 10% of revenue. Let's look at what each customer is trying to do:\nNvidia's revenue from these customers is likely to peak in 2024-2025 and then gradually decline. New customers and markets are likely to offset some losses from major tech companies, but the customer makeup here makes Nvidia prone to any cooldown in how these big software companies view AI.\nSo, How Good Is Nvidia's Valuation Right Now?\nThis is probably the most difficult part of our analysis, as we have to rely on \"guesstimates.\" There are many variables at play with Nvidia, but the current valuation looks fair, or even slightly overvalued. We do not see any signs of Nvidia being a deeply undervalued company. The market has been more than generous. (Read our article about what NVDA's current valuation priced in)\nHowever, this also does not mean that Nvidia is out of steam. Momentum has proven analysts wrong--again and again--and it can continue to do just that if the broader tech market keeps rallying.\nIf you are a momentum investor, Nvidia is a good play. Even if you are a value investor and you believe in the prospects of AI, going long on NVDA stock is not a bad idea. You could also start taking some profits if you're sitting on big gains.\nWhat we wouldn't suggest doing is shorting NVDA. The momentum here can get you burned pretty quickly.\nRegardless, all of this is short-term. Our long-term analysis is that NVDA stock is heavily dependent on the broader tech industry and macro factors. This is a cyclical stock that has a lot of room for correction if things do go wrong.\nYou're paying 36 times forward earnings for this business. The growth so far certainly warrants that premium. The problem arises when we consider whether or not that growth will stick around in the coming years.\nIf the AI segment's growth starts to falter, the market will have a very hard time justifying this premium. Moreover, any slowdown in the development of AI models or a better GPU chip by a competitor could erode Nvidia's margins quickly. Wall Street is only paying 36 times trailing sales due to its sky-high margins. However, this will not be the case if margins take a dive. This has happened before during previous downturns.\nWe have good reason to believe that any future recession would erode margins significantly. This is because AI startups and software companies will likely cut corners when it comes to GPUs if VC/public funding starts to take a hit. But again, that's if a recession happens.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhether or not you should buy Nvidia depends on how much risk you're comfortable taking. The upside here has been more and more momentum-driven, so value-focused investors should scrutinize NVDA stock more before going long.\nIf you're an aggressive investor, going long on NVDA is not a bad idea, but you should keep in mind that any pullbacks in the broader market could hurt you a lot more.\nAccording to my base case, I see Nvidia $140-220 a year from now. That said, a recession could easily drag it below $100.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an AI play, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year.\nThe past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries\u2019 balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022.\nThe Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging.\nThe tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end.\nHowever, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year.\nThe aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent.\nComing back to tech \u2013 the industry wouldn\u2019t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown.\nWhat\u2019s Ahead for the Market?\nThe US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a\u00a0Financial Times\u2019 survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed\u2019s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession.\nStory Continues\nFor instance, Piper Sandler\u2019s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the \u201cjumbo\u201d rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn\u2019t avert the problem.\nHowever, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists\u2019 estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn\u2019t without historical precedent.\nFurther, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week\u2019s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024.\nMoving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is \u2018tactically bullish\u2019 on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets \u201cpricing in a soft landing\u201d. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end.\nWith regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said:\n\u201cI think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we\u2019re kind of underweight on software.\u201d\nRowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don\u2019t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up.\nMethodology\nFor our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Driving the AI Boom with 184% YTD Gains\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n3Y CAGR: 82.08%\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), for all intents and purposes, is considered the driving force behind the AI boom, especially on the hardware side. Nvidia\u2019s core business revolves around designing Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). The company\u2019s biggest market is the gaming industry since GPUs are almost essential for high-performance rendering due to their parallel processing capabilities. As it turns out, GPUs are also incredibly useful for training AI models for the same reason, since AI models require a lot of matrix calculations simultaneously.\nIt goes without saying that Nvidia isn\u2019t the sole GPU designer but what put it at an advantage over its competitors is its proprietary parallel computing platform \u2013 CUDA. Having a GPU market share of\u00a070.5%\u00a0as of 2016, Nvidia recognized the need for a programmable architecture very early since programming parallel processing is recognized as notoriously difficult. The CUDA platform is now supported by a library of thousands of specific applications, which makes it hard to compete with Nvidia in the space of parallel programming platforms. This, coupled with the explosive demand for GPUs for training AI models, resulted in NVDA becoming the most valuable company in the world in June 2024 before Apple regained the top spot for itself. NVDA grew at an annualized rate of 82% over the past three years, and has gained nearly 212% over the past year and 184% year-to-date.\nNvidia\u2019s highly anticipated GPU \u2013 Blackwell \u2013 is expected to offer substantial inference performance gains over its previous GPUs, and is already experiencing a high level of demand from hyperscalers. The GPU will be rolled out in Q4, 2024, but has already been booked out for 12 months.\nThis is what Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein senior analyst, had to\u00a0say\u00a0about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in one of the latest CNBC programs:\n\u201cPeople are getting excited about the story again as we approach earnings, year-end, and next year when the new platform with Blackwell starts to ramp up. By all indications\u2014based on supply chain checks and everything else\u2014demand for this product looks off the charts.\u201d\nThe analyst believes the stock is trading at a discount:\n\u201cIt\u2019s much cheaper today than it was before the run started a year and a half ago. The stock has risen significantly, but earnings have increased even more than the stock.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Slowing earnings growth will likely be OPEX as AMD invests billions of dollars to capture tens of billions of future annual revenue,\u201d the analysts said.\nThe anticipated revenue increase is expected to boost AMD's bottom line, with non-GAAP earnings likely surpassing the consensus estimate of $0.92 per share.\nThe analysts flagged AMD's ability to gain market share in the server CPU segment, a trend that has been bolstered by improvements in the enterprise market over the last three months.\nThere are signs that demand for non-AI server products is also picking up, contributing to AMD's momentum in data center AI solutions.\nNorthland expects AMD to guide for revenue above consensus for the fourth quarter, fueled by ongoing strength in its AI, server CPU, and client product lines.\nThe analysts do not expect AMD to provide guidance for calendar year 2025 during the upcoming earnings report, which is anticipated in January 2025.\nHowever, they noted a sharp increase in AMD\u2019s revenue share in the server market, rising from just 2% in 2019 to 34% in the first half of 2024.\nThis growth has been attributed to AMD's competitive product offerings, which continue to outperform those of its main rival, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\nAdditionally, early performance benchmarks suggest that AMD will maintain its upward trajectory in market share with the next generation of server CPUs expected to launch in 2025.\nAMD\u2019s share in the AI accelerator market is also projected to grow, with estimates indicating an increase from 0.7% in 2023 to 3.9% in 2024.\nAnalysts at Northland believe that AMD will continue to capture a larger slice of the accelerator market moving forward, especially as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces delays with its Blackwell product family.\nThe expected release of AMD\u2019s next-generation MI325x accelerators in early 2025 is expected to position the company well against NVIDIA's offerings, further solidifying its market presence.\nThe shift toward AMD is partly driven by cloud service providers' (CSPs) desire for alternatives to NVIDIA, as indicated by year-over-year growth in AMD's AI revenue.\nAnalysts at Northland estimate that AMD could potentially double its market share over the next two years, thanks to strategic partnerships with industry giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Hugging Face.\nStory Continues\nBeyond 2025, Northland's projections suggest that AMD could generate between $18 billion and $28 billion in AI revenue by 2027, representing 6.2% to 9.7% of the AI accelerator market.\nThe total revenue for AMD in 2027 could range from $45 billion to $55 billion, contingent on steady growth in its other product lines.\nAnalysts estimate potential earnings power of $6 to $9 per share by that time, although operating expenses remain a major variable in these projections.\nWhile there are concerns regarding AMD's necessary investments to catch up with NVIDIA, Northland asserts that the company\u2019s share gains against Intel demonstrate the long-term value of AMD's strategic investments.\nRelated Articles\nAMD gains as Northland says share gains likely to continue\nSaudi Arabia stocks lower at close of trade; Tadawul All Share down 0.13%\nWise CEO cleared in FCA tax inquiry with \u00c2\u00a3350,000 penalty\nView Comments"

The stock trades at a relatively cheap price-to-earnings multiple of 23.71x. GOOGL\u2019s P/E has ranged from ~17x to ~37x in that timeframe.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeanwhile, Google is the cheapest name out of the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d names which include Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Meta Platforms (META).\nTechnical Levels & Information\nGOOGL key levels to watch:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shares are coiling above their 200-day moving average which is ~3.4% lower ($161.29).\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Google\u2019s swing low is $147.22.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Short-term resistance sits at $169.16.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There\u2019s an open daily price gap at $183.61, and all-time highs are at $191.75.\nNote: The coiled nature of shares suggests that GOOGL may move more implied move of the options, as price contraction leads to price expansion.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n3 Potential Catalysts\nBelow are 3 things to watch for during the earnings call:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cloud: Google\u2019s Cloud business is a key driver for the company. Despite the highly competitive cloud market Google generated cloud revenues of more than $10 billion in Q2 and accounted for ~12% of total revenues. Google Cloud revenue rose 28.8% year-over-year and management is making the company\u2019s main expansion segment.\nStory Continues\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Artificial Intelligence: Google has intensified its generative AI efforts with its Gemini large language model. Wall Street expects Google\u2019s AI business to grow at a scorching hot CAGR of ~50% until 2030.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Search Cannibalization Commentary: Ad revenue from Google\u2019s search business still accounts for the largest portion of total revenues by a lot. However, Google bears believe that AI will cannibalize its search business and eat into profit margins, though no evidence of this phenomenon exists yet.\nWhat to Not Expect\nThe Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) monopolistic crackdown against Alphabet is unlikely to be a factor or discussed because the legal battle is ongoing.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Though Elon Musk and Tesla deserve credit for popularizing the EV, they did not invent it. The movie \u201cWho Killed the Electric Car?\u201d profiles the limited commercialization and downfall of early EVs. Nevertheless, the Tesla teams\u2019 vision to unveil a cool and high-performance EV at scale has propelled Tesla CEO Elon Musk to become the wealthiest man on Earth. However, with some of his antics, like his \u201cFunding Secured\u201d tweet, smoking marijuana on the world\u2019s most popular podcast (The Joe Rogan Experience), and his unique and overall eccentric behavior, Musk has garnered his fair share of haters and doubters over the years, including the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) founder Bill Gates, CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, and renowned short seller Jim Chanos.\nThe fact and the matter is that Tesla is and will always be one of the biggest battleground stocks on Wall Street. Investors either hate or love Musk and, as a result, have strong feelings about the stock. \u00a0Having said that, savvy investors understand the significance of ignoring emotions and looking at the facts. Today, I will divulge five common bearish myths about Tesla and use data and numbers (not emotion) to examine why they are wrong.\n\u201cTesla\u2019s Relative Stock Performance is Poor\u201d\nA common bearish argument that I hear is that TSLA is not worth owning because it has underperformed competitors such as General Motors (GM) and fellow \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks like Microsoft and Meta Platforms (META). These investors go wrong because they fail to account for time frame context, which is critical when sizing up relative price performance. Bears will argue that TSLA is weak because it has failed to print a fresh high since late 2021. However, over the past decade, TSLA has trounced GM to the tune of 1500% to 115%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnother factor to consider is price digestion. After TSLA soared from a split-adjusted $1.79 to $17.67 in 2012-2014, the stock consolidated those gains for 5 years before again surging in 2019 and 2020 from $14 to $400. In other words, price consolidations are common after monumental price moves.\n\u201cTesla Depends on Government Handouts\u201d\nLike other clean energy stocks, Tesla has been a beneficiary of government subsidies. That said, the idea that Tesla is entirely dependent on these subsidies and would go bankrupt without them is a farce that the company proved in the recent quarterly earnings report. Though regulatory credit revenue sunk 17% quarter-over-quarter, Tesla still beat earnings expectations by a wide margin due to decreased cost of goods sold (COGS). Even with fewer subsidies, Tesla\u2019s COGS per vehicle dropped to its lowest level ever ($35.1k). Tesla smashed Zacks Consensus Estimates in the recent quarter by 24.14%.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nElon Musk\u2019s Politics Will Deter Prospective Tesla Buyers\nIf there\u2019s anything more controversial than Elon Musk, it\u2019s U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump. During this election cycle, Elon Musk is strongly supporting Trump and campaigning for him in battleground states like Pennsylvania. Bears have speculated that the support of the republican candidate will deter left-leaning customers from buying cars. However, the data says otherwise. Tesla guided auto growth to 25% in 2025, smashing Wall Street expectations. Wall Street analysts expect TSLA EPS growth of 33% in 2025. Though a handful of people may boycott the company due to Elon\u2019s politics, the issue is not systemic. Further evidence against the bear case is that Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck model is already the third-best-selling EV in America.\nWaymo Will Win the Cybertaxi Wars\nAlphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Waymo cybertaxi service has a leg up on Tesla\u2019s because it has been greenlighted in some major U.S. cities like San Fransisco and is in service, while Tesla still hasn\u2019t gone live. Nonetheless, being the first to market is not enough to win the battle. Tesla has a massive edge when it comes to training their Full Self Driving model. As a result, Tesla expects that FSD will be safer than a human driver (< 1 accident reported every 550k miles traveled). Furthermore, Tesla is far more scalable than Waymo because it doesn\u2019t rely on super expensive lidar sensors like Waymo. Though I see both companies ultimately succeeding, skeptics are very wrong to assume that Waymo will run away with cybertaxi supremacy just because they launched first.\nTesla is Expensive from a Valuation Perspective\nThe high valuation argument is the most puzzling to me of all the arguments. Even if you discount Tesla and Wall Street\u2019s rosy growth expectations (higher growth tends to demand a higher valuation), Tesla\u2019s price-to-book value aligns with where it was in 2020 before the stock quintupled.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nTesla is one of the biggest battleground stocks on Wall Street. However, details from its third-quarter earnings report suggest that bears are on the wrong side of the trade.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "This week's earnings lineup will feature a flurry of prominent companies\u00a0reporting their third quarter results.\nSet to release their Q3 reports on Tuesday, October 29, Alphabet GOOGL, Crocs CROX, and Royal Caribbean Cruises\u00a0RCL\u00a0are three noteworthy names to watch as their stocks sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe Most Undervalued Magnificent Seven Stock - GOOGL\nArguably the most undervalued of the Magnificent Seven-themed tech stocks, Wall Street will be watching Alphabet\u2019s Q3 results closely. Despite regulatory concerns prompted by Google Search being viewed as a monopoly, Alphabet\u2019s growth trajectory remains compelling.\nAlphabet has a plethora of other successful businesses that should keep its outlook intact including its reach as a cloud provider and portfolio of lucrative acquisitions like YouTube. Alphabet\u2019s top and bottom lines are thought to have expanded by doubt digits during Q3 with GOOGL trading at a very reasonable 21.6X forward earnings multiple.\nThis is the cheapest forward P/E valuation of the Mag 7 tech giants, as GOOGL trades beneath Meta Platforms'\u00a0\u00a0META\u00a026.7X and Apple\u2019s AAPL\u00a030.8X.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCrocs Blazing Footwear & Apparel Growth - CROX\nExceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus for 17 consecutive quarters, Crocs impressive streak of topping earnings expectations could continue.\nCrocs Q3 EPS is thought to have decreased 3% to $3.13 but the Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) indicates the footwear and apparel leader could surprise again with the Most Accurate Estimate at $3.15 per share and slightly above the Zacks Consensus.\nLike Alphabet, lucrative acquisitions such as acquiring the popular Heydude brand have extended Crocs' spectacular growth story. To that point, fiscal 2024 EPS projections of $12.91 would reflect a 700% increase from pre-pandemic earnings of $1.61 a share in 2019. Plus, full-year sales forecast of $4.14 billion would reflect a 236% post-pandemic increase with 2019 sales at $1.23 billion.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRoyal Caribbean is the Cruise Industry\u2019s Leader - RCL\nLast but not least, on Tuesday investors will get Q3 results from one of the world\u2019s largest cruise companies in Royal Caribbean.\nSeparating Royal Caribbean from many of its industry peers is the leisure and recreation services leaders' operating performance.\nContinuing a sharp post-pandemic rebound, Royal Caribbean\u2019s Q3 EPS is projected to spike 31% to $5.04 versus $3.85 per share in the comparative quarter (Current Qtr below). Quarterly sales projections of $4.86 billion would be a 17% spike from Q3 2023.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMagnifying Royal Caribbean\u2019s attractive outlook for FY24 and FY25 is that RCL currently trades at 17.3X forward earnings with its price-to-sales ratio\u00a0(P/S)\u00a0of 3.1X being near the optimum level of less than 2X.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nHaving impressive streaks of surpassing quarterly earnings expectations, Alphabet, Crocs, and Royal Caribbean are certainly three of the most intriguing stocks to watch this week. Furthermore, earnings estimate revisions for FY24 and FY25 have trended higher for these prominent companies which suggests now is a good time to invest in CROX,GOOGL,\u00a0and RCL.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is set to release quarterly results after the bell on Tuesday, kicking off a big earnings week for US tech giants after a wobbly run on Wall Street.\nThe company is expected to offer updates on its efforts to turn massive AI investments into new revenue streams and its position in the massive digital ad market.\nHere\u2019s what Wall Street is expecting for some of Alphabet\u2019s most significant metrics in the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter, according to Bloomberg data:\nRevenue: $86.44 billion expected ($76.69 billion in Q3 2023)\nAdjusted earnings per share: $1.83 expected ($1.55 in Q3 2023)\nCloud revenue: $10.79 billion expected ($8.41 billion in Q3 2023)\nAd revenue: $65.5 billion expected ($59.65 billion in Q3 2023)\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nLast year, Google was widely seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. But in the quarters since, Google has attempted to advance its own leadership position. Earlier this month, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sent a note to employees outlining another internal reorganization, shifting personnel to prioritize AI development.\nAnd last week, the Information reported that the company is developing AI-driven technology that takes over a web browser to complete tasks such as buying products or booking a flight. The report said that Google could preview the technology as early as December.\nAnalysts will be looking to probe the company\u2019s progress on AI integration to get a better read on the costs of developing sophisticated AI technologies. Capital expenditures are expected to exceed $12 billion for the quarter.\nEarlier this month Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sent a note to employees discussing shifting personnel to prioritize AI development, including placing the Gemini app team under Google DeepMind. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIndustry watchers also anticipate an expansion of Google's cloud business, an increasingly important segment to investors because of its use in the development of artificial intelligence. Wall Street projects Google Cloud revenue to register nearly $11 billion, boasting a roughly 28% increase from the same period last year.\n\u201cWe think GOOGL has the best cloud infrastructure for the AI era and, as a result, should allow it to better manage its cost profile compared to other cloud providers, while also benefiting from a host of new revenue opportunities,\u201d said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA Research, in a note.\nAlphabet's report arrives during a turbulent moment for the company.\nEarlier this month, the US Justice Department said in court filing that it may recommend a break-up of the company to boost competition in the search engine market. The DOJ is expected to provide a more detailed document by Nov. 20 outlining their proposed remedies.\nStory Continues\nMegacap earnings fall just a week before the tight contest between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, adding another element of unpredictability.\nAlphabet falls in the bottom half when it comes to \"Magnificent Seven\" stock performance, gaining 20% so far this year \u2014 well below Meta's (META) and Nvidia's (NVDA) spectacular climbs, but ahead of Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft's (MSFT) respective gains of 14% and 10%.\nSome analysts who are bullish on the stock see its relative affordability as an attractive feature.\n\u201cWhile we don't view the upcoming quarterly report as a likely catalyst for Alphabet, we do think shares are attractive at current levels with shares trading below the market multiple,\u201d said Wedbush analysts in a preview note.\n\u201cWe think there is a case for multiple expansion for Alphabet in the coming quarters and years as investors gain more comfort related to regulatory risk and the impact of generative AI on Google Search.\u201d\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

(NYSE:AZO) stands against other stocks to buy before they split next.\nS&P 500: Targeting 6,000 Amid Market Optimism\nThere\u2019s been a notable sense of fear among investors despite the market\u2019s current strong performance. The upcoming weeks are expected to be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and an impending election, alongside uncertainty regarding the Fed\u2019s next moves. But the fact remains that the market has shown resilience, with numerous new highs for major indices this year, although investors remain skeptical. Historically, volatility tends to increase after elections as political changes take effect. Currently, volatility is relatively low but is anticipated to rise as January approaches and clarity about potential policy impacts emerges.\nDespite prevailing uncertainties, there remains cautious optimism about the market\u2019s ability to maintain its upward trajectory. In mid-October, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC to the skepticism displayed by investors. We covered his sentiment in our article about the\u00a08 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now:\n\u201cKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents\u2019 experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nAround the same time, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss the market trends as well. On October 14, Mary Ann Bartels highlighted that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, she acknowledged that while this target is achievable, the journey may not be smooth.\nStory Continues\nBartels noted that there could be volatility ahead, as evidenced by increased hedging activity in the market. However, she remains optimistic due to the Fed\u2019s shift towards an easier monetary policy and the ongoing economic growth, which is supported by full employment, albeit with a slight slowdown in job creation. Importantly, she highlighted that corporate profits are on the rise, with earnings currently beating expectations by about 5%. This positive trend across fundamental and technical indicators leads her to believe that the market can continue its rally into November and December.\nAs the S&P 500 recently closed above 5,800 for the first time at 5,815, Bartels discussed how this milestone brings the 6,000 target closer. She echoed sentiments from Tom Lee, who suggested that market behavior could improve significantly if there is clarity regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Bartels agreed that once a winner is declared, it could trigger a relief rally as both domestic and foreign investors gain confidence in the stability of US leadership.\nTurning to the Fed\u2019s actions, Bartels addressed concerns about recent CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected. She described potential short-term volatility as a bucking bull, indicating that while fluctuations might occur, the overall trend remains upward. Her year-ahead thesis suggests both fixed-income and equity markets are poised for positive returns, albeit with some bumps along the way.\nBartels also advocated for buying opportunities in the current market environment. She specifically pointed to technology stocks and the NASDAQ, which has yet to hit a new record high. She believes technology will continue to lead the market, particularly emphasizing semiconductors as key drivers of growth. For investors looking to enter the tech sector, she sees this as an opportune moment.\nHer perspective underscores a belief in the resilience of corporate profits and economic fundamentals amid changing monetary policies and external uncertainties. At the same time, it should be noted that the optimistic outlook for the S&P 500 targeting 6,000 is significant for stock splits as it reflects positive market sentiment, encouraging companies to make their shares more accessible to retail investors. When share prices rise, splits can attract more buyers by lowering the price per share. However, it\u2019s important to note that a stock split does not change anything about a business\u2019s fundamentals. A poor company will stay a poor company post-split and a good company will stay a good company.\nMethodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of stocks that are likely to split. We then selected the 20 stocks that have experienced the highest gains in their share prices over the past 5 years and have a history of spitting their stock. From that, we picked the top 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

As a group, they have surprisingly good earnings surprise track records.\nWhile none have perfect 5-year records, two of them have only missed once during that period. All of them have earnings streaks going into this report of at least 6 beats in a row.\nAnalysts are also bullish on some of the companies ahead of the report which says a lot. For example, 2 estimates have been revised higher for the quarter on Alphabet in the last week.\nThe analysts don\u2019t like to get it wrong on earnings. They will only raise estimates ahead of a report if they are confident that the quarter is going to be better than originally expected.\nWill these Magnificent 7 stocks be able to meet high expectations this week?\nHere Come the Mag 5 Earnings Reports\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\nAlphabet has beat 6 quarters in a row. Analysts are bullish, raising earnings estimates going into this report.\nShares of Alphabet have lagged the S&P 500 this year. It\u2019s up 20.1% versus the S&P 500 up 23%. But Alphabet is also the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 stocks. It trades at just 21.6x forward earnings.\nShould Alphabet be on the short list for value investors?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nApple has beat 6 quarters in a row. It has only missed once in the last 5 years. That\u2019s an impressive record with the pandemic in that period.\nShares of Apple are up 25.8% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 at 23%. It\u2019s not cheap. Apple trades with a forward P/E of 31 and earnings are expected to be up just 8.5% this year.\nWill Apple surprise again this quarter?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\nMicrosoft has beat 8 quarters in a row. It also has only missed once in the last 5 years, in 2022.\nShares of Microsoft have lagged with a gain of just 15.5% year-to-date. It\u2019s the poorest performer of these 5 stocks. It\u2019s not cheap either. Microsoft trades with a forward P/E of 32.9.\nEarnings are expected to rise 10.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025.\nIs that earnings growth good enough or does Microsoft have to step up its game?\nStory Continues\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\nMeta Platforms has beat on earnings 7 quarters in a row. It has only missed 4 times in the last 5 years.\nShares of Meta Platforms are up 66.5% year-to-date making it the best performing stock of the Magnificent 7 stocks reporting this week. It\u2019s been busting out to new all-time highs this year.\nMeta Platforms is still attractively priced with a forward P/E of 26.7.\nShould investors get into Meta Platforms here?\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\nAmazon has beat 7 quarters in a row. For a company that historically hasn\u2019t cared if it missed, or beat, it has put together a nice earnings surprise streak.\nShares of Amazon are up 26.3% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 up 23%. Amazon hit new all-time highs earlier this year but are looking for another breakout.\nAmazon isn\u2019t cheap on a P/E basis, but it never has been. It trades with a forward P/E of 39.6.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of BofA\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stocks with The Fastest Projected EPS Growth Rates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other best BofA's top growth stocks with the fastest projected EPS growth rates.\nFor the stock market, if there\u2019s one thing that can be said with some certainty, it\u2019s that earnings and revenue growth drives share price performance. This is because a firm\u2019s stock price is a reflection of investor estimates of its future market potential. Firms that are believed to gain market share in the future often see their share price surge in the present as investors tailor their portfolios to try to get an early position in some of the biggest names of tomorrow.\nIn fact, we don\u2019t have to dig too deep to see this principle in action. The clearest example of it is in the stock of the AI chips company that\u2019s Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI stock so far. Its stock is up 199% year to date, 235% over the past twelve months, and 887% since the start of 2023. While all these returns are something that most\u2013if not all\u2013company executives would give an arm and a leg for, to see our principle in action, we\u2019ll have to dig deeper into the 887% share price gain.\nNarrowing down our analysis to this stock\u2019s performance in 2023\u2013from the start and to the end of the year\u2013its shares gained 239%. During the first half, they gained 189.5% and during Q1, the stock was up 90%. So, the shares\u2019 performance in Q2 has proven crucial as the starting point of a rally that has so far yielded an 887% share price appreciation. During Q2, the stock was up 52%, driven by the fact that on May 24th, 2023 (during the Q1FY24 earnings), the firm\u2019s CEO stunned investors when he shared that \u201cA trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.\u201d\nThis meant that CEO Jensen Huang believed that in the future, businesses would spend as much as $1 trillion on his company\u2019s products. Investors were ecstatic and they piled into the company to send its shares soaring by 24.6% between May 19th and May 26th. In this company\u2019s case, the CEO\u2019s optimism was also met by cold, hard results. During the same Q1, the firm\u2019s data center business division revenue jumped by 14% annually, in a sign that foretold the growth story of the next quarters. Mind you, this fiscal Q1 was only the second quarter following OpenAI\u2019s public ChatGPT release, so the AI wave that solidified in Q4 2024 was in its infancy.\nStory Continues\nThese hard results saw the firm annually grow its revenue by 101%, 206%, 265%, 262%, and 122% in its Q2FY24, Q3FY24, Q4FY24, Q1FY25, and Q2FY25, respectively. The top line growth has been accompanied by bottom line profits also jumping by triple digit percentages in all of the quarters. The highest reading was for Q2FY24 when its non-GAAP net income jumped by 843% year-over-year.\nThus, it\u2019s safe to say that growth is rewarded by the stock market. Yet, the high investor expectations for growth stocks also mean that they are punished harder in case they fail to meet expectations. Research from the University of Michigan analyzed data for 13 years covering consensus earnings forecasts, quarterly earnings, stock prices, market to book ratio, and price to earnings ratio to check whether growth and value stocks perform similarly if they fail to meet earnings expectations.\nTheir results\u00a0show\u00a0that growth stocks tend to fall more than value stocks when it comes to negative earnings surprises. The researchers add that the underperformance is typically before the earnings are announced since growth stocks typically preannounce their negative earnings surprise. A descriptive analysis of their data also shows that cumulative stock returns for the days between two earnings cycles are higher for low growth stocks over high growth stocks. For the lowest growth stocks, the cumulative returns for all firms analyzed were 0.66%, while those for firms with negative and positive earnings surprises were -3.57% and 5.44%, respectively. For the high growth stocks, cumulative returns for all firms were -0.58%, and the returns for those with negative and positive earnings surprises were -7.32% and 6.32%, respectively.\nThe research concisely sums up the potential of investing in growth stocks and the accompanying risks. Returning to our GPU designer, while right now it\u2019s at the center of the AI buzz, back in 2017 and 2018, it was at the center of the Bitcoin rush since gaming GPUs could also be used to mine cryptocurrencies. However, between mid-December 2017 and mid-December 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped by 83%. For the firm\u2019s quarter that ended in January 2019, this led to its gaming GPU revenue dropping by 45% year-over-year and 46% sequentially. This was because the crypto sector had over ordered GPUs, but as Bitcoin prices fell, mining became unprofitable and the over-ordering led to a glut in the market. Looking at the firm\u2019s post split stock price, this led to the stock falling by 53% between October and the end of December 2018.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of BofA\u2019s top growth stock picks, we used the bank\u2019s latest list of stocks that are rated Buy, have an EPS surprise rating, and the highest projected growth rates for the next five years. The stocks were ranked by their projected EPS growth rates.\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Leverages Search and AI for Strong Revenue Growth\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 165\nProjected EPS Growth Rate: 19%\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. It relies on advertising to generate most of its revenue, with $112 billion of its $144 billion in H1 2024 sales coming through advertising on Search, YouTube, and ads through the Google Network. Within this, 73% of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s advertising revenue was through Search, which makes the product indispensable to the firm. Its dominance in the search engine industry has also allowed the company to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident through its $11 billion in cash and equivalents as of the latest quarters. This has allowed Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to focus on cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence. It is one of the few AI companies in the world that not only has access to a foundational model but that also provides computing resources to other companies. Consequently, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a wide moat in the emerging technology. However, it remains vulnerable to changing dynamics of search engines through antitrust action and disruption.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 9th on our list of best BofA's top growth stocks with the fastest projected EPS growth rates. GOOGL is one of the top stocks with the highest consensus earnings growth according to BofA. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

However, is it the right time to buy the stock? After all, the Alphabet stock has declined from the highs it had set a few months ago.\nFear not! Alphabet's AI prowess and diverse market strengths are anticipated to drive consistent profits and raise the share price. Let\u2019s see \u2013\nAlphabet\u2019s Q3 Earnings are Expected to Boost the Share Price\nAlphabet is set to report encouraging third-quarter 2024 earnings, which may increase the share price. For the reporting quarter, Alphabet\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) is expected to be $1.83, more than $1.55, indicating a jump of 18.1%.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet has delivered a positive trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.6%, on average, a tell-tale sign that the company has a reasonable chance to post earnings growth in the upcoming earnings release.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRevenues are projected to be $72.85 billion, a jump of 13.7% from year-ago sales of $64.05 billion. The AI boom will benefit Alphabet\u2019s AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions in the third quarter, eventually boosting revenues vis-\u00e0-vis earnings.\nAnyhow, management is always involved in the share buyback process, which reduces outstanding shares and improves EPS in the long run. As a result, Alphabet stock\u2019s $7.65 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 15.2% year over year.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet\u2019s Cloud Division Continues to Exhibit Strength\nAlphabet\u2019s cloud division is facing stiff competition from Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN but it\u2019s still growing at a solid pace and may help the stock price to scale northward.\nThe rise in AI products that require a significant amount of spending on the cloud helped the segment\u2019s revenues to climb 29% year over year to $10.3 billion in the last quarter.\nWorldwide acceptance of Alphabet\u2019s Gemini and strength in large language models should help the Google Cloud division register $100 billion in annual revenues in the next five-year period, eventually helping profit margins to expand.\nNotably, the company\u2019s net profit margin is 26.7%, slightly more than the Internet - Services industry\u2019s 26.4%. Any reading above 20% indicates a high-profit margin and that the company has been able to manage expenses efficiently.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Stock to Gain From Digital Ad Spending Increase\nStrength in the digital advertising market is a boon for the Alphabet stock. This is because Alphabet is one of the leaders in digital advertising with all its products including Google Search and YouTube having over 2 billion monthly users.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is relying on AI expertise to increase usage and improve user satisfaction in the digital advertising space, which is expected to see a 10% increase in spending annually through 2028, per eMarketer.\nAlphabet Has a Monopoly in Search Engine\nWhen it comes to the search market, Alphabet has an undue advantage since its share is over 90%. Of course, ChatGPT has gained a lot of users in recent times but that\u2019s not enough to derail Alphabet\u2019s monopoly.\nAlphabet, thus, can benefit from the economies of scale it enjoys in the search market and not have to worry about competition, a tailwind for the stock price. Alphabet\u2019s overall revenues are time and again driven by the Google Search division.\nAlphabet Stock to Benefit From Robotaxi Market Growth\nDon\u2019t forget Waymo LLC, Alphabet\u2019s subsidiary, which could also be a reason for the stock price to scale upward. After all, the autonomous ride-hailing service is well-poised to gain from the expected increase of the robotaxi market by 67% annually through 2030, according to Straits Research.\nTo introduce its ride-hailing service in Austin and Atlanta by next year, Waymo has partnered with Uber Technologies, Inc. UBER and analysts at Bank of America Corporation BAC expect Waymo\u2019s revenues to climb to $75 million this year and even more in the years to come.\nAlphabet Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist\nWhile the growth in the AI industry is expected to be a blessing for Alphabet\u2019s upcoming earnings, the inherent strength in the cloud, digital advertising, search, and robotaxi markets should help the company churn out profits consistently and boost the share price.\nProminent brokers estimate that the GOOGL stock\u2019s average short-term price target is $201.78, an upside of 24% from the last closing price of $162.72. The highest short-term price target is $225, indicating an upside of 38.3%.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAdditionally, the GOOGL stock is trading above the short-term 50-day moving average (DMA) and long-term 200-DMA, signifying a bullish trend, and the perfect time to buy the stock.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe GOOGL stock is also trading at 21.6X forward earnings, less than the industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple of 23.0X. Therefore, buying the stock won\u2019t burn a hole in your wallet.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe GOOGL stock, rightfully, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This move could signal a level dancing act by Alphabet to give backing to high-risk, high-return projects to Waymo and other projects while keeping an eye on even big bottom-line hit projects that are seen to supplement Alphabet's large and varied business activities.\nMarket players and analysts find this funding round to positively affirm the company's value proposition and Alphabet's dedication to the AD lead. The considerable investment is hoped to promote Waymo and expand its work to market, which may bring autonomous vehicles to the mass market faster. This kind of funding strategic plan is essential since Waymo chases the innovation and acquisition of the market in the complex system of L5 autonomous technology.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Citigroup today announced a multiyear strategic partnership that will see the bank move parts of its vast financial infrastructure to a platform hosted by Alphabet subsidiary Google Cloud. New York\u2013based Citi, the fourth largest bank in America by assets, currently relies heavily on hardware. It expects the integration to a virtual environment will make it easier to customize its financial pipes and respond to consumers' ever-changing demands.\nAs part of the partnership, Balaji Kumar, Citi\u2019s head of global technology infrastructure, told Fortune, the bank will also be using Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI platform to build a number of financial tools for customers using artificial intelligence. Though details about which applications might launch first weren\u2019t disclosed, Kumar says \u201cquite a few\u201d pilots are already in the works.\n\u201cIt's a massive opportunity for us to engage in technology modernization,\u201d says Kumar. The infrastucture upgrade is part of a larger effort at Citi to better capitalize on the bank\u2019s financial pipes, which power much of the global economy, and comprise half of the bank\u2019s revenue.\nThough the partnership is still in its early days, Rohit Bhat, the managing director of Google Cloud\u2019s financial services division, says that Google Cloud\u2019s engineering, product, and sales teams have been working with Citi\u2019s technology and business enablement team for months and much of the technology they\u2019ve codeveloped is quite mature.\nTop among the Google Cloud upgrades at Citi is a high-performance-computing (HPC) capability that will run millions of risk calculations a day for Citi\u2019s Markets business. The software is expected to reduce latency\u2014or delays\u2014by preemptively checking transactions to ensure they have enough compute power and storage to execute.\nThrough the partnership Citi also has access to Vertex AI, the enterprise version of Google's proprietary Gemini AI, and other open source large language models (LLMs), including Gemma, Meta, and Mistral. In the future, the bank anticipates using the AI tool to complete other pilots currently being developed, including for customer service and call centers, document digitization, and customized marketing tools.\nImplementing cloud and AI tools give rise to new security considerations, ranging from where the data comes from to who can access it. To address those concerns, Kumar says, \"every use case is governed and monitored and approved\" before it is rolled out for public use. That includes careful analysis of the kind of data used, where is it is hosted, and whether the data is being stored for future use or being actively used.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe're starting with the modernization platform really focused around reducing risk,\" says Google's Bhat. \"That is the foundation layer of then how we go into some of the more innovative things we're building: new products, services, and enhancing customer experience across the firm.\u201d\nStrategic placement\nThe partnership is part of Citi CEO Jane Fraser\u2019s larger effort to highlight the role its financial infrastructure plays in the economy. Last year, Fraser reportedly reorganized the firm\u2019s business lines to emphasize the role the bank\u2019s treasury and custody services play in global finance.\n\"The end state will be a simplified operating model,\u201d says Citi's Kumar. \u201cWhich is what our CEO and our executives have talked about quite a lot: the ability for us to meet the customers where they are, for us to be able to launch products at scale.\u201d\nThis partnership is also part of Citi\u2019s broader AI strategy. A widely covered Citi report in June predicted that 56% of banking jobs were ripe to be displaced by AI. Four days after the report was published the bank announced a strategic investment in commercial lending AI startup Numerated to improve commercial lending analysis.\nCiti\u2019s stock increased 1% today. So far this year, the company's stock has increased 15% compared to a 26% increase at other U.S. banks tracked over the same period by the S&P U.S. Banks Index.\nCiti's partnership with Google places it in a strategically different position than some of its competitors. The same month Citi invested in Numerated, the Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs had deployed its own generative AI tool; and in August Fortune exclusively reported that 14,000 BNY employees were using Eliza, a new AI named after Alexander Hamilton\u2019s wife.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an Alphabet subsidiary has partnered with Citi. In November 2020 Citi announced it would work with Google to offer a checking account using Google Plex, a digital checking service that was canceled the following year.\nFor Google Cloud, the Citi deal comes as the division expands efforts to help financial institutions use artificial intelligence. Perhaps most notably, in April, Google Cloud partnered with Discover Financial Services, the parent company that runs the Discover credit card and Discover Bank, to help integrate its AI into customer services.\n\u201cWe believe that there is a material step function change in the ability for firms to understand the information that lives between their four walls,\u201d says Google's Bhat, \u201cimprove the customer experience that their clients are experiencing, and enable the developers to build net new experiences for their clients. That step function change is a combination of generative AI and machine learning.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is set to release quarterly results after the bell on Tuesday, kicking off a big earnings week for US tech giants after a wobbly run on Wall Street.\nThe company is expected to offer updates on its efforts to turn massive AI investments into new revenue streams and its position in the massive digital ad market.\nHere\u2019s what Wall Street is expecting for some of Alphabet\u2019s most significant metrics in the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter, according to Bloomberg data:\nRevenue: $86.44 billion expected ($76.69 billion in Q3 2023)\nAdjusted earnings per share: $1.83 expected ($1.55 in Q3 2023)\nCloud revenue: $10.79 billion expected ($8.41 billion in Q3 2023)\nAd revenue: $65.5 billion expected ($59.65 billion in Q3 2023)\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nLast year, Google was widely seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. But in the quarters since, Google has attempted to advance its own leadership position. Earlier this month, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sent a note to employees outlining another internal reorganization, shifting personnel to prioritize AI development.\nAnd last week, the Information reported that the company is developing AI-driven technology that takes over a web browser to complete tasks such as buying products or booking a flight. The report said that Google could preview the technology as early as December.\nAnalysts will be looking to probe the company\u2019s progress on AI integration to get a better read on the costs of developing sophisticated AI technologies. Capital expenditures are expected to exceed $12 billion for the quarter.\nEarlier this month Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sent a note to employees discussing shifting personnel to prioritize AI development, including placing the Gemini app team under Google DeepMind. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIndustry watchers also anticipate an expansion of Google's cloud business, an increasingly important segment to investors because of its use in the development of artificial intelligence. Wall Street projects Google Cloud revenue to register nearly $11 billion, boasting a roughly 28% increase from the same period last year.\n\u201cWe think GOOGL has the best cloud infrastructure for the AI era and, as a result, should allow it to better manage its cost profile compared to other cloud providers, while also benefiting from a host of new revenue opportunities,\u201d said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA Research, in a note.\nAlphabet's report arrives during a turbulent moment for the company.\nEarlier this month, the US Justice Department said in court filing that it may recommend a break-up of the company to boost competition in the search engine market. The DOJ is expected to provide a more detailed document by Nov. 20 outlining their proposed remedies.\nStory Continues\nMegacap earnings fall just a week before the tight contest between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, adding another element of unpredictability.\nAlphabet falls in the bottom half when it comes to \"Magnificent Seven\" stock performance, gaining 20% so far this year \u2014 well below Meta's (META) and Nvidia's (NVDA) spectacular climbs, but ahead of Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft's (MSFT) respective gains of 14% and 10%.\nSome analysts who are bullish on the stock see its relative affordability as an attractive feature.\n\u201cWhile we don't view the upcoming quarterly report as a likely catalyst for Alphabet, we do think shares are attractive at current levels with shares trading below the market multiple,\u201d said Wedbush analysts in a preview note.\n\u201cWe think there is a case for multiple expansion for Alphabet in the coming quarters and years as investors gain more comfort related to regulatory risk and the impact of generative AI on Google Search.\u201d\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

(NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other stocks to buy before they split next.\nS&P 500: Targeting 6,000 Amid Market Optimism\nThere\u2019s been a notable sense of fear among investors despite the market\u2019s current strong performance. The upcoming weeks are expected to be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and an impending election, alongside uncertainty regarding the Fed\u2019s next moves. But the fact remains that the market has shown resilience, with numerous new highs for major indices this year, although investors remain skeptical. Historically, volatility tends to increase after elections as political changes take effect. Currently, volatility is relatively low but is anticipated to rise as January approaches and clarity about potential policy impacts emerges.\nDespite prevailing uncertainties, there remains cautious optimism about the market\u2019s ability to maintain its upward trajectory. In mid-October, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC to the skepticism displayed by investors. We covered his sentiment in our article about the\u00a08 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now:\n\u201cKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents\u2019 experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nAround the same time, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss the market trends as well. On October 14, Mary Ann Bartels highlighted that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, she acknowledged that while this target is achievable, the journey may not be smooth.\nStory Continues\nBartels noted that there could be volatility ahead, as evidenced by increased hedging activity in the market. However, she remains optimistic due to the Fed\u2019s shift towards an easier monetary policy and the ongoing economic growth, which is supported by full employment, albeit with a slight slowdown in job creation. Importantly, she highlighted that corporate profits are on the rise, with earnings currently beating expectations by about 5%. This positive trend across fundamental and technical indicators leads her to believe that the market can continue its rally into November and December.\nAs the S&P 500 recently closed above 5,800 for the first time at 5,815, Bartels discussed how this milestone brings the 6,000 target closer. She echoed sentiments from Tom Lee, who suggested that market behavior could improve significantly if there is clarity regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Bartels agreed that once a winner is declared, it could trigger a relief rally as both domestic and foreign investors gain confidence in the stability of US leadership.\nTurning to the Fed\u2019s actions, Bartels addressed concerns about recent CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected. She described potential short-term volatility as a bucking bull, indicating that while fluctuations might occur, the overall trend remains upward. Her year-ahead thesis suggests both fixed-income and equity markets are poised for positive returns, albeit with some bumps along the way.\nBartels also advocated for buying opportunities in the current market environment. She specifically pointed to technology stocks and the NASDAQ, which has yet to hit a new record high. She believes technology will continue to lead the market, particularly emphasizing semiconductors as key drivers of growth. For investors looking to enter the tech sector, she sees this as an opportune moment.\nHer perspective underscores a belief in the resilience of corporate profits and economic fundamentals amid changing monetary policies and external uncertainties. At the same time, it should be noted that the optimistic outlook for the S&P 500 targeting 6,000 is significant for stock splits as it reflects positive market sentiment, encouraging companies to make their shares more accessible to retail investors. When share prices rise, splits can attract more buyers by lowering the price per share. However, it\u2019s important to note that a stock split does not change anything about a business\u2019s fundamentals. A poor company will stay a poor company post-split and a good company will stay a good company.\nMethodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of stocks that are likely to split. We then selected the 20 stocks that have experienced the highest gains in their share prices over the past 5 years and have a history of spitting their stock. From that, we picked the top 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) a Top Stock to Buy Before the Next Split?\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nShare Price as of October 18: $416.12\nSurge in Share Price in 5 Years: 202.83%\nStock Split Confirmed: no\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology company that develops, manufactures, and licenses software, hardware, and services. Founded in 1975, it became one of the most influential companies in the personal computer revolution with its Windows operating system. Today it offers a range of products and services, including the Windows operating system, Office productivity suite, Azure cloud computing platform, Xbox gaming consoles, and Surface devices.\nIts stock has rallied after a recent decline, supported by a key technical level. Despite a general market downturn and concerns about Azure cloud computing revenue, the company\u2019s focus on AI and its strong fundamentals position it for potential growth.\nFQ4 2024 revenue increased 15.20% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in Microsoft Cloud, up 21% from a year-ago period. Individual Office sales grew 4%, while Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales increased 19%. Bing usage rose 3%. Azure revenue surged 30%, fueled by partnerships with Lumen Technologies and Palantir.\nThe company\u2019s Copilot, an AI-powered productivity assistant, has seen significant growth, with Office 365 Copilot customer numbers increasing by over 60% sequentially in FQ4. With an Office 365 user base exceeding 400 million, Copilot\u2019s future in productivity tools looks promising. Placing Platform Limited (PPL) has partnered with Microsoft to enhance its specialty insurance trading platform. This collaboration will leverage Microsoft\u2019s data and AI capabilities to create a more efficient and data-driven platform.\nIn October, Lenfest Institute, OpenAI, and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) have launched a $10 million AI Collaborative and Fellowship program to support US metro news organizations in exploring and implementing AI technologies.\nThe company\u2019s healthcare AI innovations offer a promising but risky investment opportunity. While the potential for high growth exists, the competitive and regulated market presents challenges. Continued investment in AI and cloud infrastructure positions the company as a market leader.\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cGenerative AI\u2019s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called \u2018inference\u2019). Some of the latest trends worry us.\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category \u2013 nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google\u2019s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of stocks to buy before they split next.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nWhile Apple's shares climbed 0.4%, so valuing the firm at $3.52 trillion, Nvidia's stock rose 0.8%, so reflecting the worth of the business at the end of trade.\nWith their closely matched market valuations, Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) have all helped Wall Street reach its record highs this year. In June, Nvidia was first; thereafter, Apple and Microsoft took front stage. Following a 0.8% stock rise, Microsoft's market value as of Friday came to $3.18 trillion.\nKey processor provider for artificial intelligence computing, Nvidia's stock increased roughly 18% in October. The spike tracked a $6.6 billion fundraising round revealed by OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT.\nFollowing Western Digital (WDC, Financials) with better-than-expected quarterly earnings, semiconductor stocksincluding Nvidiaalso surged on Friday, inspiring hope about data center demand.\nAmong options traders, Nvidia is a favorite because of its recent performance. Strong profit projections and growing demand for artificial intelligence technologies have sent the company's shares about 190% year-to-date upwards.\nApple also struggles with declining smartphone demand, especially in China where iPhone sales dropped 0.3% in the third quarter while competitor Huawei's phone sales shot 42%. On Thursday, Apple is likely to show a 5.55% year-over-year sales rise to $94.5 billion; experts predict Nvidia's revenue to rise about 82% to $32.9 billion.\nWith Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft accounting for over a quarter of the S&P 500's weight, its stock has been a significant determinant of the index's climb to new highs. Investors see great promise in artificial intelligence and anticipate the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, therefore stimulating the market.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Five of the Magnificent 7 stocks are reporting earnings including Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc.\nOf the other two Magnificent 7 stocks, Tesla reported better-than-expected earnings last week and NVIDIA Corp. will report earnings in late November.\nHow Good Are Their Earnings Surprise Records?\nThat means all eyes will be on the \u201cMag 5\u201d this week. As a group, they have surprisingly good earnings surprise track records.\nWhile none have perfect 5-year records, two of them have only missed once during that period. All of them have earnings streaks going into this report of at least 6 beats in a row.\nAnalysts are also bullish on some of the companies ahead of the report which says a lot. For example, 2 estimates have been revised higher for the quarter on Alphabet in the last week.\nThe analysts don\u2019t like to get it wrong on earnings. They will only raise estimates ahead of a report if they are confident that the quarter is going to be better than originally expected.\nWill these Magnificent 7 stocks be able to meet high expectations this week?\nHere Come the Mag 5 Earnings Reports\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\nAlphabet has beat 6 quarters in a row. Analysts are bullish, raising earnings estimates going into this report.\nShares of Alphabet have lagged the S&P 500 this year. It\u2019s up 20.1% versus the S&P 500 up 23%. But Alphabet is also the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 stocks. It trades at just 21.6x forward earnings.\nShould Alphabet be on the short list for value investors?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nApple has beat 6 quarters in a row. It has only missed once in the last 5 years. That\u2019s an impressive record with the pandemic in that period.\nShares of Apple are up 25.8% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 at 23%. It\u2019s not cheap. Apple trades with a forward P/E of 31 and earnings are expected to be up just 8.5% this year.\nWill Apple surprise again this quarter?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\nMicrosoft has beat 8 quarters in a row. It also has only missed once in the last 5 years, in 2022.\nShares of Microsoft have lagged with a gain of just 15.5% year-to-date. It\u2019s the poorest performer of these 5 stocks. It\u2019s not cheap either. Microsoft trades with a forward P/E of 32.9.\nEarnings are expected to rise 10.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025.\nIs that earnings growth good enough or does Microsoft have to step up its game?\nStory Continues\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\nMeta Platforms has beat on earnings 7 quarters in a row. It has only missed 4 times in the last 5 years.\nShares of Meta Platforms are up 66.5% year-to-date making it the best performing stock of the Magnificent 7 stocks reporting this week. It\u2019s been busting out to new all-time highs this year.\nMeta Platforms is still attractively priced with a forward P/E of 26.7.\nShould investors get into Meta Platforms here?\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\nAmazon has beat 7 quarters in a row. For a company that historically hasn\u2019t cared if it missed, or beat, it has put together a nice earnings surprise streak.\nShares of Amazon are up 26.3% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 up 23%. Amazon hit new all-time highs earlier this year but are looking for another breakout.\nAmazon isn\u2019t cheap on a P/E basis, but it never has been. It trades with a forward P/E of 39.6. However, Amazon is expected to grow its earnings by double digits this year and next.\nShould Amazon be on your short list?\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, with Nvidia estimated to have between 75% and 90% of the market, that\u2019s not saying much.\nFor the quarter, AMD is expected to bring in adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.7 billion, based on analyst consensus estimates from Bloomberg.

          "whole_article": "Today is Bill Gates' birthday. And it was 49 years ago this spring that he and Paul Allen founded Microsoft\u2014a company that has had a lasting impression and impact on the software industry, and Big Tech itself.\nTo build such a successful company, which now boasts a whopping $3.125 trillion market capitalization, Gates rarely took breaks. In fact, he said that in the early days of Microsoft, he really didn\u2019t even believe in them, Gates told Northern Arizona University\u2019s graduating class in 2023.\n\u201cWhen I was your age, I didn't believe in vacations. I didn't even believe in weekends,\u201d said Gates, who was about 20 years old when he started Microsoft. \u201cI pushed everyone around me to work very long hours.\u201d\nIn fact, he recalls overlooking Microsoft\u2019s parking lot each day to \u201ckeep track of who is leaving early and who is staying late.\u201d It took Gates decades to realize that this level of scrutiny wasn\u2019t appropriate\u2014nor sustainable.\n\u201cAs I got older\u2014and especially once I became a father\u2014I realized that both in terms of doing your best work and having a great life, that that intensity was not always appropriate. Don't wait as long as I did to learn this lesson.\u201d\nIndeed, Gates emphasized the value of being easy on yourself.\n\u201cYou are not a slacker if you've cut yourself some slack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took me a long time to learn [that].\u201d\nA little over a decade ago, Gates launched his own blog, Gates Notes, sharing about the people he meets, the books he\u2019s reading, and what he\u2019s learning. But over the years, he\u2019s shared some other advice about life and success. Here are three insightful things we can learn from Gates, who is now worth about $153 billion.\nAsk questions when problem-solving\nBusiness leaders are consistently tasked with problem-solving\u2014whether it\u2019s something with long-term or short-term implications. Gates says he always starts his problem-solving process by asking two questions: Who has dealt with this problem well? And what can we learn from them?\n\u201cEver since I was a teenager, I've tackled every big new problem the same way: by starting off with two questions,\u201d Gates wrote in a 2020 blog post. I used this technique at Microsoft, and I still use it today.\u201d\nWhile they\u2019re seemingly simple questions, they can serve as good starting points for research about how best to address a challenge.\n\u201cThey seem like obvious questions,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut sometimes it's surprisingly hard to find the answers.\u201d\nManage your time wisely\nAn unlikely character taught Gates the value of effective time management: billionaire buddy Warren Buffett. While Buffett is undoubtedly one of the most powerful and wealthy people in business, he takes a very lenient approach to his calendar.\nStory Continues\n\u201cI\u2026remember Warren showing me his calendar,\u201d Gates said in a 2017 interview with Charlie Rose. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on it.\u201d\nGates, on the other hand, used to have \u201cevery minute packed\u201d on his calendar, and \u201cthought that was the only way you could do things.\" But Buffett taught him the value in saving time to let yourself just think.\n\u201cYou control your time,\u201d Gates said. \u201cSitting and thinking may be a much higher priority than a normal CEO, where there [are] all these demands and you feel like you need to go and see all these people.\u201d\nAnd having every second marked off in your calendar doesn\u2019t make you any better of a business leader, Gates said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a proxy of your seriousness that you fill every minute in your schedule,\u201d he said.\nBe understanding and patient\nWhile it took Gates awhile to realize the implications of his intensity during the early days of Microsoft, he came away with one key takeaway about being a fruitful leader\u2014and it has nothing to do with managing money, and all to do with time and people.\n\u201cPatience is a key element of success,\u201d Gates said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Microsoft (MSFT), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry.\nThis software maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3.18%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Microsoft came out with earnings of $2.95 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.90 per share, representing a surprise of 1.72%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.94 per share, delivering a surprise of 4.63%.\nPrice and EPS Surprise\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Microsoft. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of +0.35% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 30, 2024.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nStory Continues\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This demand is fueled by the increasing migration of workloads to the cloud.\n\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter, Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% (up 30% at cc), including roughly 8 points from AI services where demand remained higher than available capacity.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, Microsoft expects Azure revenue growth at cc between 28% and 29%, with increasing contributions from all Azure AI services.\n\nMicrosoft is witnessing an acceleration of revenues from migrations to Azure. MSFT has become the hyperscale platform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, with Atos, Coles, Daimler Truck AG, Domino\u2019s and Haleon migrating their mission-critical SAP workloads to Azure.\n\nAzure's increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally is expected to have strengthened this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s competitive position in the cloud computing market, dominated by Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud division, Amazon Web Services, and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nDespite these cutting-edge AI moves, shares of Microsoft have gained 18.3% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s 23.8% growth amid intensifying competition from Amazon and Alphabet as they are all making aggressive moves to expand their generative AI capabilities. Shares of AMAZN and GOOGL have returned 22.7% and 30.1%, respectively.\nAzure AI Gives MSFT Competitive Edge in Generative AI Market\nMSFT\u2019s AI innovation continues to build on its strategic partnership with OpenAI. Azure OpenAI Service provides access to best-in-class frontier models, including, as of this quarter, GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. It is being used by leading companies in every industry, including H&R Block, Suzuki, Swiss Re and Telstra, as well as digital natives like Freshworks, Meesho and Zomato.\n\nWith Phi-3, Microsoft is offering a family of powerful, small language models, which are being used by companies like BlackRock, Emirates, Epic, ITC, Navy Federal Credit Union and others.\n\nThe company also continues to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open-source models, LLMs and SLMs.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Models as a Service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs and SLMs without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Hundreds of paid customers, from Accenture and EY to Schneider Electric, are using it to take advantage of API access to third-party models, including the latest from Cohere, Meta and Mistral.\n\nMicrosoft is also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows, or build a website. To date, more than 480,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 45% quarter over quarter.\nIn total, Microsoft now has 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40% year over year.\n\nThe number of Azure AI customers and average spending continues to grow. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company had more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year.\nStory Continues\nGrowing Adoption of MSFT\u2019s Copilot to Boost Q1 Prospects\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers, as it transforms work, workflow and work artifacts. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter over quarter. Copilot customers increased more than 60% quarter over quarter. This trend is likely to have continued in the quarter under review.\n\nMore than 1,000 paid customers have used Copilot for Security, including Alaska Airlines, Oregon State University, Petrofac, Wipro and WTW. Microsoft now has more than 1.2 million security customers. More than 800,000, including Dell Technologies, Deutsche Telekom and TomTom, use four or more workloads, up 25% year over year.\n\nThe number of customers with over 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl and Novartis while EY alone will deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees.\nKey AI Announcements in Q1\nIn the quarter under review, Microsoft announced a five-year multibillion-dollar strategic alliance with KT Corporation to develop AI innovations and transformations for over 650,000 businesses and 17 million consumers across Korea.\n\nMicrosoft, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and MGX announced the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership to make investments in new and expanded data centers to meet the growing demand for computing power, as well as energy infrastructure to create new sources of power for these facilities.\n\nMicrosoft announced a significant advancement in its partnership with Palantir PLTR to bring some of the most sophisticated and secure cloud, AI and analytics capabilities to the U.S. Defense and Intelligence Community.\n\nMSFT announced a collaboration with Lumen to expand its network capacity and capability to meet the growing demand for its data centers due to AI.\n\nThe launch of enterprise capabilities of Azure OpenAI and Copilots across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform is expected to have been a game changer in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Delta did not immediately comment on CrowdStrike's suit.\nCrowdStrike is seeking a declaratory judgment plus legal fees.\nDelta's lawsuit filed on Friday in Fulton County Superior Court called the faulty software update from CrowdStrike \"catastrophic\" and said the company \"forced untested and faulty updates to its customers, causing more than 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to crash.\"\nDelta said the faulty update caused 7,000 flight cancellations, disrupted travel plans of 1.3 million customers and cost the carrier more than $500 million.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit, also filed on Friday, said Delta's own response and technology caused delays in the carrier's ability to resume normal operations.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit reiterated its contention that it has minimal liability, something Delta rejected.\nDelta said CrowdStrike is liable for over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses as well as for unspecified lost profits, expenditures - including legal fees - reputational harm and future revenue loss.\nThe incident prompted the U.S. Transportation Department to open an investigation.\n\"If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed,\" Delta's lawsuit says.\nDelta said it has invested billions of dollars in information technology licensing and infrastructure.\nLast month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologized before Congress for the faulty software update.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nIn a recent Tech Check program, CNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI\u2019s head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries.\nAs reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself.

Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data \u2014 cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result\u201d.\nDespite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly \u201challucinating\u201d. OpenAI may deem it to have near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy\u201d, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments.

Non-fuel expenses amounted to $170 million, while fuel costs were $50 million lower than they would have been had the flights not been cancelled. Third-quarter per-share profit was also dented by $0.45.\n\"Because the faulty update could not be removed remotely, CrowdStrike crippled Delta's business and created immense delays for Delta customers,\" the airline said in its lawsuit.\nAmid the fallout from the outage, Delta brought on David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner to seek damages from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft, including compensation for losses and litigation expenses related to the matter.\nIn a statement late on Friday cited by Reuters, CrowdStrike said Delta's claims were based on \"disproven misinformation\" and \"demostrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works.\" The lawsuit was a \"desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure,\" CrowdStrike added.\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\nRelated Articles\nCrowdStrike shares slightly lower premarket amid Delta lawsuit over summer outage\nMorgan Stanley explains why rates are rising\nEuropean shares gain as key data and US tech earnings loom\nView Comments"

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\nCheck out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhat's The Opportunity In CrowdStrike Holdings?\nGreat news for investors \u2013 CrowdStrike Holdings is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $420.23, but it is currently trading at US$301 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from CrowdStrike Holdings?\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. CrowdStrike Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRWD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CRWD for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy CRWD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nStory Continues\nIf you want to dive deeper into CrowdStrike Holdings, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

          "whole_article": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Delta Air Lines sued CrowdStrike on Friday, claiming the cybersecurity company had cut corners and caused a worldwide technology outage that led to thousands of canceled flight in July.\nThe airline is asking for compensation and punitive damages from the outage, which started with a faulty update sent to several million Microsoft computers. Delta said the outage crippled its operations for several days, costing more than $500 million in lost revenue and extra expenses.\nCrowdStrike said Delta is giving \u201cmisinformation,\u201d does not understand cybersecurity and is trying to shift blame for its slow recovery from the outage.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating why Delta took longer to recover than other carriers. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the department also would look into complaints about Delta customer service during the outage, including long waits for help and reports that unaccompanied minors were stranded at airports.\nIn its lawsuit, Delta claims that the outage occurred because CrowdStrike failed to test the update before rolling it out worldwide.\nDelta canceled about 7,000 flights over a five-day period during the peak summer vacation season. The outage also affected banks, hospitals and other businesses.\n\u201cCrowdStrike caused a global catastrophe because it cut corners, took shortcuts, and circumvented the very testing and certification processes it advertised, for its own benefit and profit,\u201d Delta said in the lawsuit, which was filed in Fulton County Superior Court in Georgia, near the company's headquarters.\nA CrowdStrike spokesperson said the company tried to resolve the dispute \u2014 one of its lawyers said in August that CrowdStrike's liability to Delta was less than $10 million.\nThe spokesperson said Delta's claims are based on \"misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.\u201d\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n2024 has been a big year for AI breakthroughs, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Generative AI has arguably been the biggest trend, with McKinsey estimating that it could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries annually, based on 63 use cases they analyzed. Back in 2022, when OpenAI launched its free web app, ChatGPT, few could have predicted the scale of the AI revolution that would follow. Major tech giants have since followed suit, revealing their own chatbot-based assistants, AI-enabled phones, and much more.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and\u00a020 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\nAs AI continues to revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries to new heights, today\u2019s headlines reveal just how impactful these advancements can be. The question of the hour is, with all of these big AI breakthroughs, are regulators finally catching up with developers working on their next big AI projects? Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a global cybersecurity company that provides cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data. The company employs world-class AI and ML to detect and prevent modern threats with the speed and scale of the cloud.\nOn Tuesday, October 23, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) announced that it is partnering with Omnissa, a leading digital work platform company. The partnership aims to deliver real-time threat detection and automated remediation for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and physical desktop environments, all while improving upon customers\u2019 digital work experience and productivity. The partnership, forming amid rising worldwide security threats, aims to combine CrowdStrike's AI-based endpoint security with Fortinet's network firewall technology to handle cyber-attacks.\nWhile endpoint security helps safeguard individual devices such as computers and phones, network firewalls help regulate incoming and outgoing network traffic. The combination of the two elements helps bridge the gap through collaboration, offering a holistic approach to cybersecurity, and allowing organizations to detect and respond to threats more efficiently across their entire IT infrastructure. It is also a reflection of the growing trend in the cybersecurity industry to consolidate and integrate security tools.\nOverall CRWD ranks 9th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

It was for identity threat protection software intended for the US Internal Revenue Service, according to documents from both companies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nRobotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nArgentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge\nBut the IRS never bought the software, according to records reviewed by Bloomberg News and people with knowledge of the situation.\nStill, Carahsoft has been making on-time payments on the $32 million to CrowdStrike, according to the cybersecurity firm. When asked for comment by Bloomberg News, both companies explained that they had a \u201cnon-cancellable order\u201d between them. They declined to say why that deal was struck without a purchase in place from the IRS. Shares of CrowdStrike fell as much as 2.7% after Bloomberg News reported about the deal.\nSome legal and accounting experts, who reviewed the arrangement at Bloomberg\u2019s request, said it raises red flags that merit scrutiny from regulators. The deal also raised concerns within CrowdStrike \u2014 according to people familiar with the matter and the company itself \u2013 and many specifics of the transaction remain unclear.\nDepending on how CrowdStrike accounted for the deal in financial statements \u2014 the company didn\u2019t explain those details \u2014 it was big enough that it could have made the difference between the company beating or missing Wall Street projections for the period. The day after CrowdStrike reported results for the record quarter, its shares rose 10%.\nJeremy Fielding, a spokesperson representing CrowdStrike, dismissed employees\u2019 concerns as baseless and the order\u2019s timing as insignificant. The Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm closes deals \u201cthroughout the quarter, starting the first day and often through the last day,\" he said.\nStory Continues\n\"The Carahsoft deal went through a separate and extensive review,\" he said, adding that it \"was given a clean bill of health.\" Fielding characterized the experts\u2019 comments as \u201cinaccurately speculating about a transaction that CrowdStrike confirmed fully met\u201d an accounting standard on revenue from contracts. CrowdStrike \u201cclosed and recognized\u201d the deal once Carahsoft placed the order, and its booking of the revenue is consistent with standard accounting principles, according to Thomas Clare and Elizabeth Locke, lawyers representing the cybersecurity company.\nA representative of Carahsoft, Mary Lange, said in an email, \u201cCarahsoft is a private company and we do not disclose financial information or customer details. That said, we placed a valid, non-cancellable order with CrowdStrike and stand by that transaction.\u201d The company declined to answer any other questions.\nThe IRS didn\u2019t answer detailed questions. The tax agency said in a statement that it doesn\u2019t hold any contracts with CrowdStrike directly and, in keeping with federal procurement rules, acquires its software and services through third-party vendors.\nNo IRS contract or payments matching the deal appear in the public government spending database USASPENDING.gov. The database excludes some information \u2014 for instance, material that could compromise national security. But the tax agency\u2019s purchases of CrowdStrike\u2019s products through vendors total less than $10 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.This story is based on records of the transaction and interviews with five people familiar with the matter, who requested that their names not be published because they aren\u2019t authorized to discuss it.\n\u201cIt raises an eyebrow,\u201d said Lawrence Cunningham, director of the University of Delaware\u2019s John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance.\n\u201cIt appears on its face to be uncompensated risk, and rational businesses don\u2019t usually accept uncompensated risk,\u201d Cunningham said, referring to Carahsoft\u2019s payments to CrowdStrike.\nCarahsoft declined to answer questions about whether it was taking a loss on the deal or if it found a way to recoup the money.\nIn recent months, separate issues at CrowdStrike and Carahsoft have drawn negative attention and government scrutiny.\nCrowdStrike, with annual revenues of more than $3 billion, sells security software to thousands of businesses and government agencies globally. But in July, a flawed update from the firm knocked out millions of Windows computers around the world, disrupting air travel, medical care, banks and other businesses. Executives have apologized repeatedly, including before members of Congress; the company\u2019s share price plummeted after the outage and hasn\u2019t fully recovered.\nCarahsoft is a dominant player among resellers and distributors that help technology companies navigate the complexities of selling to government agencies. In September, agents from the FBI and the US Department of Defense searched the company\u2019s Reston, Virginia, headquarters. Lange, the Carahsoft spokesperson, previously said the company was cooperating with the FBI probe and that it involved \u201can investigation into a company with which Carahsoft has done business in the past.\u201d The Justice Department is also conducting a civil probe of Carahsoft and software giant SAP SE for potential price fixing on government contracts. The German firm is cooperating with the civil probe, a spokesperson said. SAP Chief Financial Officer Dominik Asam told Bloomberg News that SAP had \u201cgotten written assurance from Carahsoft\u201d that the FBI search was \u201centirely unrelated\u201d to SAP and a US subsidiary.\nThere\u2019s no known link between CrowdStrike and either the civil investigation or search of Carahsoft\u2019s office. Fielding, the CrowdStrike representative, said neither investigation is connected to the cybersecurity company.A potential deal for the IRS dates to early 2023, when CrowdStrike sales representatives began talking with agency officials about buying an identity verification tool to help prevent fraud in a new program that lets people file their taxes directly with the government, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nWork continued on a potential deal in the following months, but by mid-October it had become clear to at least some CrowdStrike staff that the IRS wouldn\u2019t order the software before the company\u2019s quarter closed at the end of the month, the people said.\nNevertheless, on Halloween, Carahsoft ordered $32.25 million worth of subscription access to CrowdStrike\u2019s \u201cGovernment National Identity Threat Protection\u201d service for as many as 40 million users, according to records and two of the people. The order split the purchase into four $8 million payments, with the final payment due at the end of this October. The order indicates that Carahsoft should be billed for the CrowdStrike software and that it should be shipped to the IRS\u2019s Washington headquarters.\nThat day, CrowdStrike sent an automated email to dozens of staff, saying, \u201cOpportunity has been Closed Won for Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\u201d\nThe closing of the deal and Kurtz referring to it on the earnings call alarmed some staff who raised internal concerns that CrowdStrike was \u201cpre-booking\u201d a transaction that they viewed as incomplete because it was unclear whether the IRS would ever make the large purchase, according to three of the people. US regulators have in some cases sued and fined companies over alleged pre-booking, also known as channel stuffing, claiming they misled investors by improperly recognizing revenue to inflate their financial figures.\nFielding said it was \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d that there was any pre-booking.\nThat quarter, $32 million was enough to make the difference between CrowdStrike beating analysts\u2019 expectations on two key financial metrics \u2014 annual recurring revenue and net new annual recurring revenue \u2014 or falling short of them. CrowdStrike highlighted both metrics in the earnings announcement for the quarter, but the company declined to answer questions about whether the deal was recorded under them.\nAnnual recurring revenue is widely used by software companies to track income from subscriptions. CrowdStrike has consistently emphasized it with investors, writing in a 2019 regulatory filing that it \u201cis a key metric to measure our business.\u201d\nTheresa Gabaldon, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, said that for CrowdStrike to appropriately book the deal as revenue it would need to have not only received payment but also delivered the product. Neither CrowdStrike nor Carahsoft answered questions about what became of the subscription software.\n\u201cI characterize it as raising red flags,\u201d Gabaldon, who teaches securities regulation, law and accounting, said of the deal.\nWhatever happened, Carahsoft was among the companies that CrowdStrike feted at a June \u201cpartner symposium.\u201d There, Kurtz and other CrowdStrike staff mingled with guests at a luxury resort on the southern California coast. A video shows attendees enjoying drinks and live string music on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean and getting sushi-making lessons from a celebrity chef.\nAt the event, CrowdStrike named Carahsoft \u201cDistributor of the Year.\u201d\n--With assistance from Charles Gorrivan.\n(Updates with CrowdStrike share drop in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nA New Economy for Wood Is Slowly Taking Root in California\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\nWho Thinks China\u2019s Not an Economic Powerhouse?

Visa delivered an EPS of $2.42, which met estimates. However, the company reported revenue of $8.9 billion, slightly missing analysts\u2019 expectations of $8.924 billion. Still, this figure represents a 9.6% increase from the $8.12 billion reported a year earlier.\nGrowth was fueled by an increase in cards in circulation, rising from 4.1 billion to 4.5 billion, which boosted transactions and transaction volume. Visa processed 59.32 billion transactions during Q3, a 9.8% increase from 54.03 billion in the same period last year, resulting in a payments volume of $3.78 trillion for the quarter.\nDespite initial market pessimism following Visa\u2019s Q3 earnings call, the stock has risen by around 12% since then. This performance came despite three Wall Street analysts lowering their price targets, offset by one upgrade and two price target increases.\nHow Fiscal Q4 Is Shaping Up for Visa\nOne of my concerns about adopting an ultra-bullish stance ahead of Visa\u2019s earnings is the potential for Q4 to be weaker than anticipated. In its earnings call, Visa\u2019s management indicated that the outlook for upcoming quarters, including Q4, could be slightly softer due to external factors such as a hurricane affecting parts of Texas, a cyber outage from CrowdStrike (CRWD), and various macroeconomic pressures.\nManagement also stated that Q4 non-GAAP revenue should grow at a low double-digit rate, with a 10% growth translating to approximately $9.47 billion. Wall Street\u2019s consensus is slightly higher at $9.48 billion, reflecting 10.25% growth, despite 19 of 21 analysts revising estimates downward in the past three months. For EPS, Visa guided for high single-digit growth, with analysts expecting $2.58, implying 10.8% annual growth.\nBeyond topping analyst\u2019s expectations, a key focus for Visa\u2019s upcoming earnings will be its progress in \u201cvalue-added services\u201d (VAS), a significant growth driver. In Q3, Visa generated $2.2 billion from VAS, a 23% increase, positioning the company to exceed $8 billion in VAS revenue this year. This reflects Visa\u2019s efforts to diversify its revenue streams beyond traditional swipe fees and progress in this area is likely to positively influence the stock price\u2019s reaction.\nStory Continues\nIs V a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\nLooking at Wall Street consensus, 23 out of 28 bullish analysts rate Visa Stock a Strong Buy, with an\u00a0average price target of $314.09 implying a potential upside of 10.29%.\nSee more V stock analyst ratings\nMastercard\u2019s Q2 Recap\nShifting focus to Mastercard, the second-largest credit card company globally, I hold a slightly more bullish stance on the stock ahead of its earnings. Mastercard has performed well in 2024, with shares up 21%. The company\u2019s recent quarters indicate that it is benefiting from a resilient global economic environment, which is driving steady earnings growth.\nIn Q2, Mastercard reported revenues of $7 billion, marking an 11% year-over-year increase, which exceeded the $6.85 billion consensus. The company also posted adjusted diluted EPS of $3.59, a 24% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of $3.51. However, the most notable shortcoming in the report was purchase volume, which totaled $1.97 trillion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $2.01 trillion.\nWhat likely fueled the 17% rally in Mastercard\u2019s shares after its Q2 results was CEO Michael Miebach\u2019s statement that double-digit top and bottom-line growth was driven by \u201ccontinued healthy consumer spending.\u201d This was in contrast to Visa\u2019s management, which highlighted a slight moderation in spending within the lower consumer segment in the U.S. Consequently, seven Wall Street firms raised their target prices for Mastercard, with only one reducing their estimate.\nHow Q3 Is Shaping Up for Mastercard\nWhile I\u2019m leaning more bullish on Mastercard ahead of its earnings, it\u2019s important to note that growth expectations for the September quarter are quite similar to Visa\u2019s. Mastercard\u2019s Q3 guidance anticipates low double-digit growth in non-GAAP revenues, with Wall Street projecting $7.26 billion\u2014an 11.2% year-over-year increase. The company also expects operating expenses to rise by low double digits, aligning with consensus estimates of Q3 EPS at $3.74, reflecting a 10.5% year-over-year increase.\nAlthough the bar for top-line estimates is relatively high, with 17 out of 19 analysts raising their projections in the last three months, I believe there is minimal risk of Mastercard missing revenue expectations\u2014something it hasn\u2019t done since Q3 2020\u2014unlike Visa, which missed last quarter.\nMoreover, the recent Fed rate cut has likely supported both Mastercard and Visa shares by boosting card usage activity, which may be better reflected in Q3 results. Another significant factor that could drive Mastercard\u2019s stock higher is its international performance, with gross dollar volume (GDV) growing 9% year-over-year in Q2, compared to 6% growth in the U.S. This outpaced Visa\u2019s 5% growth in both the U.S. and internationally, potentially explaining Mastercard\u2019s outperformance relative to Visa throughout the year.\nIs MA a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\nThe Wall Street consensus on Mastercard is highly favorable, with 22 out of 26 analysts recommending a Buy, giving it a Strong Buy rating. The average price target of $537.54 implies a potential upside of 4.78%.\nSee more MA analyst ratings\nKey Takeaway\nWhile I have a long-term bullish outlook for both Visa and Mastercard, if I had to choose one as the better buy ahead of its earnings, I would lean toward Mastercard. Although this is a close call, I believe Mastercard has a stronger chance of exceeding estimates, given its recent earnings performance and the more confident narrative from its management regarding growth expectations amid macroeconomic challenges and on the international front.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

Although markets have been volatile over the past couple of weeks, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has been making a steady climb. On Oct. 25, the Nasdaq hit an all-time high, led by mega-cap stocks ahead of their upcoming earnings and the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).\nGiven the ongoing tech rally and expectations of more rate cuts this year, it would be ideal to invest in Nasdaq stocks such as Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW, whichhave strong potential for the near term. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNasdaq Hits Record High\nOn Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.6% to close at an all-time high of 18,518.61 points. The index also closed 0.2% higher for the week, recording its seventh straight week of gains, its longest winning streak for 2024.\nYear to date, the Nasdaq Composite has gained 23.4% after soaring 43.4% in 2023, recording its best year since 2020.\nTech stocks rallied last year after a lackluster 2022 when rising interest rates negatively impacted growth stocks. The rally has since continued and gathered steam this year, boosting the Nasdaq. The current rally is largely being fueled by stocks focused on artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, which is also helping the broader market.\nAI Enthusiasm Powering Tech Rally\nWhile AI experts' opinions, particularly on the future of generative AI, are divided, the optimism surrounding this field has been enormous over the past year. Many believe that AI is still in its early stages and that its full potential has yet to be tapped. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been a frontrunner in generative AI and has been pivotal in the surge in interest in this field. Its shares have soared 185.8% year to date.\nNVIDIA\u2019s solid progress in the generative AI space has seen several tech giants trying to leave a prominent footprint in that area. Also, the advancement of smart devices is supporting the field as they require computing and learning abilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analytics. These functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, which are all favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry.\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a strong recovery as a result, following a period of challenges until the first half of 2022.\nStory Continues\nAlso, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first since March 2020. This has been further aiding growth assets, especially tech stocks. Low interest rates typically have a positive impact on growth assets. Market participants are now expecting two more interest rate cuts of 25 basis points each this year, which should further help tech stocks.\n4 Nasdaq Stocks With Upside\nAlphabet Inc.\nAlphabet Inc. is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, GOOGL has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others.\nAlphabet\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 31.9%.

AVGO\u2019s semiconductor solutions are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays.\nBroadcom\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 14%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the past 60 days. AVGO currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\nNetflix, Inc.\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\nNetflix\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 64.4%.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year.\nThe past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries\u2019 balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022.\nThe Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging.\nThe tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end.\nHowever, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year.\nThe aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent.\nComing back to tech \u2013 the industry wouldn\u2019t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown.\nWhat\u2019s Ahead for the Market?\nThe US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a\u00a0Financial Times\u2019 survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed\u2019s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession.\nStory Continues\nFor instance, Piper Sandler\u2019s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the \u201cjumbo\u201d rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn\u2019t avert the problem.\nHowever, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists\u2019 estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn\u2019t without historical precedent.\nFurther, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week\u2019s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024.\nMoving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is \u2018tactically bullish\u2019 on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets \u201cpricing in a soft landing\u201d. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end.\nWith regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said:\n\u201cI think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we\u2019re kind of underweight on software.\u201d\nRowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don\u2019t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up.\nMethodology\nFor our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom (AVGO): Leading with Custom Silicon and Strategic Acquisitions\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n3Y CAGR: 55.87%\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been one of the most profitable stocks in the S&P500 index over the past few years. The company has been very successful in its patent portfolio strategy by acquiring other tech companies by leveraged buyouts. Some of its recent acquisitions include CA Technologies and VMware, with VMware being especially prominent.\nFurther, Broadcom is the biggest player in the custom silicon market that lets other companies design their own AI accelerators, which are increasingly opting for specific chips for specific use cases.\nFollowing is what Clearbridge Large Cap Value strategy had to say about AVGO in their Q3, 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Broadcom is:\n8.4% = US$5.5b \u00f7 US$66b (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2024).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.\nDoes Broadcom Have A Good Return On Equity?\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Broadcom has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Semiconductor industry classification.\nroe\nUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Broadcom visit our risks dashboard for free.\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\nBroadcom's Debt And Its 8.4% ROE\nBroadcom clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.06. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\nStory Continues\nSummary\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\nOf course Broadcom may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, emphasized the ongoing significance of fossil fuels in supporting technological advancements, even as investments in renewable energy continue to increase. He stated:\n\u201cThis is not just a grudge match between the old and the new, a battle of electric vehicles versus internal combustion. The truth is, fossil fuels are essential for a lot more than vehicles, like it or not.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Stock Picks\nCramer highlighted the growing energy demands of major tech companies, noting that the data centers they are constructing consume vast amounts of electricity. While these tech giants are making substantial investments in nuclear energy, he pointed out that this power source is unlikely to significantly impact data centers for at least another decade due to the complexities of building nuclear facilities and community resistance to having them nearby.\n\u201cIf we need more energy, we\u2019re going to get it from what comes out of the ground \u2026 fossil fuels that will power the data center, specifically natural gas\u2026 You may be reluctant to invest in it, you might think who cares, but you need to know how vital all of this fossil fuel technology is to the growth of the Magnificent Seven.\u201d\nCramer also reflected on the shift in the U.S. energy landscape, recalling how the nation was once heavily reliant on OPEC for oil imports just two decades ago. Today, he pointed out, the U.S. produces over 13 million barrels per day, making it the largest oil producer globally and a net exporter. He mentioned the Permian Basin's unexpected resilience, continually producing despite earlier predictions of depletion.\nCramer noted that the decline of OPEC has transformed the geopolitical landscape. He referenced the 1973 oil crisis, triggered by OPEC's retaliation against U.S. support for Israel, which led to stagflation and economic turmoil. In contrast, he pointed out that despite Israel's current conflict, the U.S. economy is not experiencing stagflation or recession, resulting instead in a bull market. He attributed this stability to the industry, saying:\n\u201c... This industry that spent billions upon billions of dollars to try to be as low carbon as possible is the reason why oil prices have actually come down during this period. They've gotten so much production that OPEC is now powerless.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTurning his attention to the broader oil industry, Cramer explored the role of oil service companies that facilitate production, including offshore drillers. He recalled becoming optimistic about oil service stocks earlier in the year, anticipating higher energy prices but admitted that this expectation did not materialize due to economic concerns dampening oil and gas markets. Despite current investor reluctance toward oil service stocks, Cramer suggested that sentiment could shift over time, especially because of the Federal Reserve's recent rate cutting.\n\u201cNow that the FED is our friend and more rate cuts are on the table, that's good news for the industry. I am not worried about the election either. If Trump wins, maybe we're back to that \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d thing. If Harris wins, we get exactly what we've had the last four years. Not ideal for the industry but it's still led to record oil and gas production here in the United States.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 23 and 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nCramer expressed enthusiasm about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) and said, \u201cBuy. Charitable Trust name, doing incredibly well\u2026 I like Broadcom, I like Hock Tan.\u201d\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) specializes in the design, development, and supply of semiconductor devices, building on a strong foundation in semiconductor innovation. In the third quarter, the company reported total revenue of $13.1 billion, marking a significant increase of 47% from the same period last year. A contributor to this growth has been the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products and services, which brought in $3.1 billion during the quarter.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects that AI will become a key driver of growth moving forward, projecting $3.5 billion in AI revenue for the upcoming fourth quarter. The company has found considerable success in providing custom AI accelerators, specialized chips designed to handle AI workloads, to major hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. In the third quarter, sales of these AI accelerators skyrocketed, increasing by three and a half times compared to the previous year.\nOn October 14, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $220 from $190 and maintained an Outperform rating. The firm forecasts tailwinds in artificial intelligence, custom silicon, and networking through 2025 and 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AVGO) the Best FAANG Stock To Buy According to Analysts?\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nAnalyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 10.9%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters.\n2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies such as the industry\u2019s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. To keep its strategy active, on October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom\u2019s subsidiary, T-Systems. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider.\nOn June 13, Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, appeared in an Interview on Yahoo Finance where she shared her bullish stance on AVGO. Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man\u2019s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components.\nAs Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\"\nOverall AVGO ranks 4th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.

In this piece, we will look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) sits on the fund managers' radar.\nThe surge in interest surrounding artificial intelligence has meant that the stock market in 2024 has continued to surprise. Just like most Wall Street analysts were left scratching their heads after worries of a recession proved to be unfounded, this year, analysts have continued to revise their year end targets of the flagship S&P index multiple times. Take the example of investment bank Goldman Sachs. Its latest index year end target was released in October, and as of now, the bank believes that the index will close at 6,000 points by the end of this year.\nBefore the October target, the bank had upped its year end estimate to 5,600 points in June. This was based on optimism for big tech stocks and the rush surrounding AI that continued to fuel them. This had added 400 points to the previous target of 5,200 points which was released in February, and this in turn had added 100 points to the previous upward revision of 5,100 over the first Goldman Sachs S&P year end target of 4,700 points.\nSafe to say, the market has beaten expectations in 2024. Its recent value of 5,832 points leaves it just 2.8% shy of Goldman\u2019s latest 2024 estimate. The index is up by 23.6% year to date, and to see just how much its returns have been driven by artificial intelligence, consider the fact that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange\u2019s semiconductor stock index is up 27.8% year to date. AI, and particularly semiconductor stocks, continue to make their mark and the key question now is whether this performance will be sustained after the third quarter earnings season.\nThe Q2 season was nothing short of fireworks for some of the biggest AI names. Two firms in particular come to mind when we reminisce. The first is Wall Street\u2019s AI darling which is known for making the best AI GPUs in the world, and the second is the firm behind Windows OS that has invested billions of dollars in the AI upstart OpenAI.\u00a0 Both these stocks did well in the first half of 2024 but pared back some of their gains in H2. Starting from the GPU company, its stock is up 186% year to date. However, from the peak in June which had marked 181% in YTD gains back then, the shares are up by a modest 1.84%. For the software company, the shares peaked at 26% year to date returns before the Q2 earnings season, and since the peak, they are down 10.4%.\nStory Continues\nThe difference in their share price appreciation isn\u2019t surprising even though it might appear to be so. Simply put, the reason the GPU maker has posted stronger returns is its products are the immediate need of the AI industry. On the other hand, the software company\u2019s products are part of a later wave of AI which counts upon strong demand for AI products within the business world to enable it to turn a profit. Turning a profit is key since it has already invested billions of dollars into OpenAI.

Research from BofA covering their performance for the first quarter shows that 64% of actively managed large cap US mutual funds beat their benchmarks. This was a sizeable jump over 38% of funds beating the benchmarks last year, with the bank speculating that a broadening of equities performance was part of the reason driving the returns. A study from The Wall Street Journal adds to this. It looks at the performance of large cap growth funds during H1 2024 and shares that the Magnificent 7 stocks drove large cap growth funds to the top of the mutual fund pyramid. The survey looked at 1,218 funds to determine that just 15% were in the red, with the average 12 month return of all the surveyed funds being 16.5%.\nWhile on one end of the spectrum are the risk averse mutual funds, on the other, are hedge funds that chase alpha through leverage. This risk means that the funds can accumulate large losses that take years to recover from. This is the case for some of the funds, according to Goldman\u2019s latest industry report. It shows that Tiger Global, Whale Rock, and Third Point which fell 50%+, 45%, and 21.8% in 2022 still haven\u2019t recovered. In 2023, the three respective funds posted 28.5%, 18%, and 4.1%, while their performance through July was 10.7% and 10.9% for Tiger Global and Third Point and 18.9% through May for Whale Rock.\nIn fact, GS\u2019 data shows that roughly one third of long-short funds are yet to recover their 2022 losses, as they are joined by 31% of event driven funds and 45% of macro driven funds. However, some of the top performing funds in the first half were Bridgewater Associates and Citadel, which posted 14.1% and 13.7% in returns respectively. The top performer among hedge funds appears to be AQR Capital with its long/short fund delivering 16.3% in returns.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that hedge funds and mutual funds love and hate, we divided Goldman\u2019s Hedge Fund Trend Monitor and Mutual Fundamentals report into four categories. These categories are stocks that both avoid, stocks that both love, and stocks favored by one but avoided by the other. Stocks within these categories were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 130\nCategory: Most popular with HFs and underweight among mutual funds\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a diversified hardware and software company. On the hardware front, it is primarily a semiconductor designer that sells chips such as modems, network controllers, and ASICs. Its network processors and ASICs expose Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to revenue from the AI industry on multiple fronts. The processors are used in data center connectivity and the firm benefits from the growth in data centers stemming from higher AI use. Additionally, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s ASIC division means that it is able to design and sell chips tailor made for custom use cases. These are important in the AI era as well, especially since the industry\u2019s mainstay GPUs from NVIDIA are in short supply and costly. Subsequently, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) can benefit from a growth in industry interest towards developing custom AI chips. On the software front, the firm benefits from high margin revenue through its cybersecurity division. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s fiscal Q3 saw software revenue jump by 300% due to its VMWare acquisition.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 15th on our list of stocks that fund managers love and hate according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy.

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -3.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.4% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.13 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for AVGO _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 14.3% below.\nAfter much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank\u2019s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\nWhile some processors and graphics chips stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.5% since the latest earnings results.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nOriginally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.\nBroadcom reported revenues of $13.07 billion, up 47.3% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, and overall, it was a satisfactory quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates but underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter.\n\"Broadcom's third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware. We expect revenue from AI to be $12 billion for fiscal year 2024 driven by Ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers,\" said Hock Tan, President and CEO of\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Total Revenue\nInterestingly, the stock is up 13.3% since reporting and currently trades at $173.26.\nIs now the time to buy Broadcom?

It was a disappointing quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nBroadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. The company expects about $12 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2024, which means 20% of its total revenue will come from AI and counting.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4.

Many are closely watching trends and data that could impact future growth and stability.\nTom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently shared his insights on the current market trends during an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 14. He acknowledged that he underestimated the strength of the market, noting that it has been surprisingly resilient despite expectations of volatility leading up to the 2024 election. Lee highlighted that there is a significant amount of cash\u2014about $6 trillion\u2014sitting on the sidelines, which has contributed to the market\u2019s stability. He observed that many investors had anticipated a recession, but instead, companies have shown strong earnings and resilience.\nLee also mentioned that the Federal Reserve is likely to adopt a supportive stance as inflation data continues to trend toward their 2% target. He believes that regardless of who wins the upcoming election, stocks are likely to perform well in the following year. Lee pointed out that markets tend to thrive on visibility and certainty, suggesting that if one candidate appears to be gaining an advantage, it could lead to a more favorable trading environment before the election. Overall, he remains optimistic about the market\u2019s outlook.\nS&P 500 and Dow Reach New Heights Ahead of Election Season\nOn October 18, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached new record highs, marking six consecutive weeks of gains for these major indices. As reported by CNBC, the S&P 500 rose by 0.40%, closing at 5,864.67, while the Dow rose by 0.09% and added 36.86 points to close at 43,275.91. The Nasdaq also performed well, increasing 0.63% to close at 18,489.55. This marks the longest winning streak of the year for both the Dow and S&P 500, with notable increases in their overall performance.\nAs earnings season progresses, over 70 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their results, with about 75% of those companies surpassing expectations. Despite potential market volatility leading up to the upcoming election, some analysts believe that stocks may continue to rise through November.\nRob Williams, a chief investment strategist at Sage Advisory, noted that this trend is unusual for an election year, where markets typically hesitate before improving post-election. He suggested that investors might be optimistic about a possible victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose policies are seen as more favorable for businesses in terms of regulations and taxes.\nStory Continues\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners.

From the initial list, we narrowed our choices to stocks that have grown their revenue positively over the past 5 years. We further refined our selection to include only those that had positive revenue growth each year in their last five reported annual revenues.\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the revenue CAGR over the past five years, and Macrotrends, which offered information on historical annual revenue data. Finally, we have ranked the 10 stocks with consistent growth to buy below in ascending order based on their five-year revenue CAGR.\nAdditionally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds as of Q2 of 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do?

We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Darren. Good afternoon, everyone, I really appreciate you joining today. Because a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report, I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow is growth trajectory. First is elite level execution, with our Q3 results we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution.\nWe outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand. The defense logistics agency works with ServiceNow assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project.

The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life saving mission.\nMercedes Benz work to its ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

Overall, this was a strong quarter.\nIs now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million.\nAlso, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 39.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $959.64 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,034.\nStory Continues\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Still, they underlined ServiceNow's strong foundation for monetizing generative artificial intelligence solutions by 2025.\nFollowing in line, Stifel and RBC raised their price estimates to $990 and $1,045, respectively.

Current remaining performance obligation, a measure of booked sales, increased 26% in the period ending Sept. 30. Both exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company makes applications that help companies organize and automate their personnel and information technology operations. Like its peers, ServiceNow is baking generative AI features into its products and offers a pricier tier with those tools.\nThe company\u2019s main generative AI assistant product, Now Assist, is the fastest-growing in company history, Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott said in an interview. The average contract premium for users of Now Assist is 30%, he added.\nThe shares hit a record high Thursday in New York, jumping about 6%. Investors were initially unimpressed with the results, with the stock trading down Wednesday evening. The shares had increased 28% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close. That\u2019s more than twice the rally seen in the iShares Expanded Software ETF, which is often used as a sector benchmark.\nThe results \u201cvalidate the company\u2019s rare standing in enterprise software,\u201d wrote Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup. He cited strong execution in a tough environment for tech spending and early monetization of generative AI.\nIn recent weeks, ServiceNow and software peers like Salesforce Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have begun emphasizing AI \u201cagents\u201d that can complete tasks without user supervision. Some customers are already trying ServiceNow\u2019s agents, which will be released more broadly next month, McDermott said. Once the agents are fully rolled out, they\u2019ll be priced differently from other products, McDermott added.\nFor the current quarter ending in December, ServiceNow projected subscription revenue of about $2.88 billion, just ahead of analyst estimates. The company expects near-term bookings to rise 21.5%.\nThis bookings guidance was effectively \u201cgood, but not great,\u201d Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note. He added that the company tends to issue conservative forecasts for the fourth quarter.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also announced the hiring of a leader from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Cloud for a prominent role. Amit Zavery will fill titles vacated earlier this year by CJ Desai as president, chief product officer and chief operating officer. Zavery will focus on product and engineering, McDermott said. His first-year compensation is targeted at about $2 million, with a $3 million signing bonus, according to a filing.\nDesai left the company in July after a complaint about a government contract and the hiring of a former US Army technology leader. He has since been tapped for a high-level executive role at Cloudflare Inc.\nLast month, Bloomberg reported that Carahsoft Technology Corp., a government-focused technology reseller, was under investigation alongside SAP SE for potentially conspiring to overcharge federal agencies.\nCarahsoft is also a major partner of ServiceNow\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re currently not involved in any issues related to Carahsoft and the US federal business,\u201d McDermott said when asked about the issue during a call with analysts Wednesday.\nProfit, excluding some items, was $3.72 per share, ahead of analyst estimates. The company saw a spike in large deals worth more than $5 million in annual contract value, it said.\nServiceNow hired more than 1,200 workers in the quarter. The company now has 25,743 employees. Much of the hiring is of quota-bearing sales representatives, which shows \u201cour confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Gina Mastantuono during the call.\n(Updates share reaction in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 97\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc.

Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year to $2.5 billion and free cash flow grew 47% year-on-year to $1.2 billion. The company\u2019s core operating metrics were also impressive with remaining performance obligations growing 26% year-on-year to $17.7 billion (i.e. roughly 2x 2023 revenue) and renewal rates holding steady at 98%. Performance was evenly spread across segments, products, and geographies, with notable strength in the US federal government. The company now boasts 1,933 customers generating in excess of $1 million in Annual Contract Value (ACV), which is pleasing to see as it implies multiple solutions are involved and that the company\u2019s platform model is increasingly resonating with customers. In our view, ServiceNow is one the highest quality software businesses globally as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it a compelling opportunity.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4.

          "whole_article": "Digital agents powered by artificial intelligence have emerged as the latest battleground for major technology firms.\nAs the number of companies seeking to streamline business operations with the advanced tech grows, the competition between Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) has been especially pronounced.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nOn Monday, Microsoft became the latest company to jump into the agent race, launching 10 autonomous agents as part of a suite of enterprise tools unveiled at its AI Tour event. Touting the feature as \u201cthe new apps,\u201d Microsoft hailed its ability to simplify enterprise tasks, saying initial pilots showed a 90% reduction in lead times and a 30% reduction in administrative work.\n\u2022 USD\n(CRM)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n\u201cThe impact of this is tremendous,\u201d said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, speaking in London. He added, \u201cWe now have at-scale evidence of how these tools are fundamentally changing, \u2026 increasing value, and reducing waste.\u201d\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at the company's annual conference for software developers on May 6, 2019, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe announcement came just weeks after Salesforce announced the buildout of its own autonomous agents through the Agentforce platform, underscoring the AI-driven opportunity companies see in enterprise.\nHailed by Salesforce as the third wave in the AI revolution, customized agents enable companies to move beyond traditional chatbots that answer to preprogrammed responses to digital assistants that can reason, tackle multiple tasks at the same time, and make judgments based on a broader set of data.\nSalesforce AI CEO Clara Shih said the use cases are especially abundant in customer relations management, where agents can handle everything from product returns to crafting sales pitches.\n\u201cIt goes from being a single step prescribing, almost micromanaging what the AI should do versus asking the agent to figure out what it needs to do,\u201d said Shih in an interview with Yahoo Finance (video above).\nMicrosoft, Salesforce tout digital assistants as the future\nOther companies have touted their own specialized use cases for AI agents.\nCloud software provider ServiceNow (NOW) has announced plans to integrate AI agents into its human resources and IT platform. Dating app Grindr is working on an AI agent wingman that would seek out relationship prospects and help set up dates. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) helps clients develop their own agents for internal use, including legal work.\nAnd in a recent podcast interview, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang envisioned a future where 100 million AI agents would be deployed within the company.\n\u201cOur inbox is going to be full of directories of AIs that we work with,\u201d he said. \u201cAIs will recruit other AIs to solve problems. AIs will be in Slack channels with each other and with humans.\u201d\nStory Continues\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks onstage with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff during Salesforce's Dreamforce on Sept. 17, 2024, in San Francisco, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \u00b7 Justin Sullivan via Getty Images\nHowever, the battle over autonomous agents has pit Salesforce and Microsoft against each other in particular, in part because the companies have clashed publicly but also because of the trove of enterprise data both have access to. CEO Marc Benioff has repeatedly likened Microsoft\u2019s Copilot to Clippy, its doomed Office assistant from the 1990s, once listed as one of Time\u2019s 50 worst inventions.\nAt its Dreamforce event last month, Shih doubled down on the criticism, without naming Microsoft directly, while touting the Agentforce platform.\n\u201cThis is the difference between a DIY science project versus a real enterprise-grade agent you can confidently deploy into production,\u201d Shih said. She added that Salesforce agents showed 33% greater accuracy and \u201ctwo times greater relevance\u201d than competitors, according to customer benchmarks.\nEarlier this week, Microsoft said agent deployment in companies like McKinsey & Company and UK-based Pets at Home have already been shown to cut down on time spent processing time-consuming work, including data entry.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nWith the wider release of Agentforce set for Oct. 29, Shih emphasized that these agents are not meant to replace human workers but assist them so that \u201chumans can start at higher level.\u201d\nShih expects Salesforce\u2019s advantage to grow as the battle for digital assistants heats up because of its ability to connect individual clients\u2019 data through Data Cloud and the safety layers in place for Agentforce.\nShe said human interaction with digital assistants will \u201cgrow exponentially.\u201d\n\u201cI think it's similar to asking the question maybe in 1998 of, in the future, how many other interactions will be through the internet or some sort of digital medium,\u201d Shih said. \u201cI very much believe that agents will play that role in the future. Agents will become the apps that all of us interface with.\u201d\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"
