          "whole_article": "Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) stock surged 6% in after-hours trading Tuesday as the company reported fiscal third quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong growth in its cloud business.\nThe search giant reported earnings per share of $2.12 on revenue of $88.27 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30. That represents a profit and sales increase from the same period last year of 37% and 15%, respectively.\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAnalysts were anticipating earnings per share of $1.83 on revenue of $86.44 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAdvertising revenue topped $65.85 billion versus analysts' expectations of $65.5 billion, up from the year-ago period's $59.65 billion.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of the cloud unit in an earnings call Tuesday, noting that the company's AI portfolio is attracting new customers and leading to larger deals. Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, surpassing expectations.\n\u201cThis business has real momentum, and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace gen. AI,\" he said.\nThe run-up in cloud revenue comes as rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are also expected to grow their cloud businesses and ramp up investments in AI infrastructure. Google plans spend roughly $13 billion on capital expenditures for the current quarter, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the call. And the company anticipates another increase in AI and data infrastructure spending in 2025.\nGoogle also faces competition on its home turf with the introduction of increasingly sophisticated AI-powered chatbots. On Monday the Information reported that Meta (META) is developing its own search engine to drive its Meta AI chatbot, providing users with conversational answers to their questions and prompts.\nHow the next generation of answer engines compete with Google's traditional and AI-boosted search remains a key question for the company.\nPichai framed the expansion of AI search tools as boosting the user experience. AI Overviews, Google's search feature that offers concise answers to user queries, now reaches 1 billion users on a monthly basis, the company announced Monday.\n\u201cPeople are asking longer and more complex questions and exploring a wider range of websites,\" Pichai said. \"What's particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn that Google can answer more of their questions.\"\nSimilar to legacy search results, users are shown advertisements that Google places alongside AI Overviews.\nStory Continues\nGoogle is the first of the Big Tech platforms to report this week, with Meta and Microsoft set to release quarterly results on Wednesday, followed by Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). While all the megacaps have posted share price gains so far this year, the stocks have forged divergent paths as investors are no longer gauging their AI spending and the success of their business lines in lockstep.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Meta has jumped more than 20% twice and dropped as much as 25% over the past eight releases, so even a 7% implied move pales in comparison.\n\u201cWe see options-implied moves for earnings across Big Tech names roughly in line with historical averages,\u201d said Celine Zhao, head of US equity research at Optiver. \u201cHowever we have not seen much of an increase in skew for these names, suggesting limited demand for downside protection around earnings. This could be due to fewer fears around market concentration, capex spending or valuations, compared with the last two quarters.\u201d\nInvestors will be closely watching the results and outlooks from the companies, which together represent more than 20% weighting in the S&P 500 index, after the stellar earnings reported by technology firms earlier in the year. The earnings will be followed next week by the closely contested US presidential election and Federal Reserve meeting, piling up a slew of potentially market-moving events for investors to protect against.\nBreaking it down a bit further, in five of the past eight quarters Apple\u2019s options implied a larger swing than was actually realized, while Microsoft options were more expensive in six of eight. On the other hand, Meta\u2019s swings have outpaced the implied moves more than half the time, sometimes by more than 10 percentage points.\nAlthough Nvidia Corp. doesn\u2019t report this week, investors will be watching capital spending outlooks closely, as four of the companies account for a large chunk of the chipmaker\u2019s sales. Near-term Nvidia option volatility edged higher on Monday.\nThe broader technology sector appears relatively inexpensive with earnings and the US election approaching, according to Goldman Sachs\u2019 derivatives sales trading desk, which sees Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (ticker QQQ) calls cheap relative to SPDR S&P 500 ETF trust (ticker SPY).\nStory Continues\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s NVDA and Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI.\nHere is a synopsis of all three stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nCyberArk Software is a global leader in identity security. The company provides the most comprehensive security offering for any identity across business applications, distributed workforces, hybrid cloud environments, and throughout the DevOps lifecycle.\nAnalysts have taken a bullish stance on the company\u2019s earnings outlook, landing it into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nIn addition to favorable earnings estimate revisions, the stock resides in the Zacks Computers \u2013 IT Services industry, currently ranked in the top 20% of all Zacks industries. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.\nCyberArk Raises Guidance\nThe outlook for its current fiscal year has remained very bullish, with the $2.29 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up more than 60% over the last year and suggesting a sizable 105% growth rate year-over-year. Sales growth is also forecasted to be strong, with the $940 million expected 25% higher than FY23.\nShares saw a nice pop following its latest set of quarterly results, now trading at all-time highs. Stocks making new highs tend to make even higher highs, particularly when positive earnings estimate revisions are present.\nConcerning the above-mentioned print, CyberArk delivered record revenue and saw a profitability uptick, also outperforming its previous guidance across all metrics. The company is enjoying a snowball of demand, with Subscription revenue of $158.4 million nearly 50% higher than the year-ago figure.\nThe company raised its full-year guidance across the board following the print, explaining the positive share reaction post-earnings. The company\u2019s growth trajectory is expected to continue nicely, as shown below.\nThe valuation picture here is quite rich, but that\u2019s a reflection of investors\u2019 big growth expectations. Shares currently trade at an 11.4X forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio, well above the 9.1X five-year median but still beneath five-year highs of 14.2X.\nThe stock sports a Style Score of \u2018F\u2019 for Value. While the valuation picture may steer some away, the company\u2019s robust growth is undeniable.\nBottom Line\nInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank \u2013 one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.\nStory Continues\nThe top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.\nCyberArk Software would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nBear of the Day:\nUlta Beauty is a leading beauty retailer in the United States. The company offers a wide range of products, including cosmetics, fragrances, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores.\nAnalysts have taken a bearish stance on the stock\u2019s outlook, lowering their earnings expectations across the board and landing it into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\nIn addition, the company is in the Zacks Retail \u2013 Miscellaneous industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 42% of all Zacks industries. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the company.\nUlta Shares Disappoint\nULTA shares have been hit hard in 2024, down 23% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500. Quarterly results that have largely disappointed have been a driver behind the share plunge, with the stock not seeing a sustained post-earnings move higher following several periods.\nWhile the company\u2019s sales growth has been notably strong over recent years, regularly impressing the market, the growth rates have cooled significantly, as shown below. Please note that the chart below tracks the % YoY change in sales, not actual sales numbers.\nThe stock traded at high multiples for years thanks to its explosive growth, with the current 16.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple a bargain relative to five-year highs of 80.8X. Still, while the stock is historically cheap, waiting for positive earnings estimate revisions to hit the tape would be a better approach.\nBottom Line\nSlowing growth paints a challenging picture for the company\u2019s shares in the near term.\nUlta Beauty is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company\u2019s earnings outlook.\nFor those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) \u2013 these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.\nAdditional content:\nBuy Meta Platforms: Q3 Earnings Might Be a Game-Changer\nMeta Platforms Inc. is the world\u2019s largest social media platform. The company\u2019s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta\u2019s family of products.\nThe tech giant is set to release its third-quarter 2024 earnings results on Oct. 30, after the closing bell. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP of 2.83%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nOur research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better (Rank #1 or 2) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings release. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\nMeta Platforms is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence (AI). A section of financial experts raised questions about the timing of the monetization of these massive investments.\nA possible earnings and revenue beat will ensure META\u2019s ability to a great extent about AI spending monetization. This along with a favorable Zacks Rank should drive its stock price significantly in the near future.\nFactors to Be Considered for Third Quarter\nMeta Platforms is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.3 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching the 200 million user milestone.\nMETA is riding on strong advertising revenue growth prospects. In the second quarter of 2024, advertising revenues increased 21.7% year over year to $38.33 billion, accounting for 97.9% of revenues. Meta Platforms\u2019 advertising revenues are expected to benefit from strong spending from advertisers as they leverage its growing AI prowess.\nMETA has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads. META\u2019s significant investment in AI is expected to help it gain market share in the digital advertising space.\nKey metrics like Family daily active people, ad impressions and average price per advertisement are likely to remain solid on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, reflecting the dominant position of the company in the digital advertising market.\nHowever, the Meta Platforms Reality Labs division (which includes virtual reality, augmented reality and metaverse initiatives) has been a significant drag on profits. It remains to be seen how the company is approaching profitability for this segment and if massive investment in AI has aided this initiative.\nSolid Earnings Estimate Revisions for META Shares\nFor third-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently shows revenues of $40.16 billion, suggesting an improvement of 17.6% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.17, indicating an appreciation of 17.8% year over year. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters with the average beat being 12.6%.\nMoreover, META has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the last seven days. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 20% and 44.2%, respectively, for revenues and EPS in 2024.\nThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues and EPS reflects an upside of 14% and 13.3%, respectively. In addition, META has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 19.1%, significantly higher-than the S&P 500 index\u2019s growth rate of 13.1%.\nMore Catalysts for META Stock\nMeta Platforms is set to receive initial shipments of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s new flagship AI chip later this year. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META is set to get B200 Blackwell chips.\nMETA\u2019s AI-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms.\nManagement said that the company will invest $37-$40 billion as capital expenditure in AI initiatives in 2024. Moreover, capital spending is likely to reach more than $50 billion in 2025.\nOn July 24, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA\u2019s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbent like Open AI.\nOn Oct. 24, Meta Platforms entered into a multi-year deal with Thomson Reuters Corp. \u00a0to allow its AI chatbot access to news content for responses to current events and news questions. This constitutes a significant AI partnership between a tech behemoth and a news publishing giant.\nStrong Upside Left for META Shares\nYear to date, the stock price of Meta Platforms soared nearly 62%, well above the Zacks defined Internet Software Industry\u2019s gain of 23.1%. Despite this, META is currently trading at an attractive valuation compared to its peers. The stock has a forward price/earnings (P/E) of 26.5X, below the industry\u2019s P/E of 32.9X. META has a robust return on equity of 34.2%.\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 9.1% from the last closing price of $573.25. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $425-$811. This indicates a maximum upside of 41.5% and a maximum downside of 25.9%.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

          "whole_article": "Microsoft (MSFT) is at the forefront of the AI arms race, boasting an exceptional business model that consistently generates substantial and growing free cash flow. With the company\u2019s current valuation appearing fair, now may be an opportune time to buy its shares. I have a 12-month price target of $482.40, while the average Wall Street price target is $503.27. Therefore, I am decidedly bullish on MSFT stock, both in the short and long term.\nMicrosoft Should Not Be Underestimated in AI\nI am particularly bullish on Microsoft because it is widely recognized as a global leader in AI. Based on my analysis, Microsoft is likely at the forefront of the AI market, as demonstrated by its $10 billion commitment to ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This investment has enabled groundbreaking products like\u00a0Microsoft Copilot,\u00a0which integrates AI into its Office suite to improve productivity for millions of users. Notably, ChatGPT reached one million users in less than five days and 100 million users in about two months\u2014a feat of unprecedented growth.\nFurthermore, Microsoft, alongside partners like BlackRock (BLK), is involved in the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, which aims to raise up to $100 billion to develop data centers and energy infrastructure supporting AI operations. This partnership aligns with Microsoft\u2019s long-term strategy to lead the global AI industry. In the medium term, investors can anticipate growth driven by AI integrated into Microsoft\u2019s cloud services (Azure).\nHowever, the industry is crowded with Big Tech competitors, including Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and the unexpected outperformer Meta (META). Among these, I consider Meta to pose the most significant competitive threat to Microsoft, as it has open-sourced its frontier AI models, enabling third parties to iterate on the source code and advance the technology more rapidly\u2014a strategy Microsoft has not adopted.\nMSFT Stock Is Attractive for Growth Investors\nOne of the primary reasons I view Microsoft as an outstanding long-term investment is its robust history of generating substantial free cash flow. At the time of this writing, the company\u2019s free cash flow margin exceeds 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last trailing 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments.\nWhile Microsoft may not appear as a value investment, it is reasonably priced, in my view, given its consistent revenue and earnings growth, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. I estimate a 13% normalized EPS growth over the next 12 months. Based on this forecast, I hold a price target of $482.40, estimating the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of approximately 36.\nStory Continues\nLooking further ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next five to 10 years. While this outlook requires purchasing the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price presents an opportunity. The company\u2019s forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only a 6.5% premium over its five-year average, while its forward diluted EPS growth rate has expanded by nearly the same amount, at 5.8%.\nMSFT Faces Potential Headwinds in the Long Term\nOne potential challenge to Microsoft\u2019s long-term growth in AI is that its adoption may be cyclical. Currently, demand for AI systems is high, prompting Microsoft and other Big Tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks\u2014potentially due to macroeconomic constraints\u2014a slowdown in growth is likely.\u00a0According to the TipRanks Risk Analysis tool, Microsoft faces 32% of its risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is above the sector average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny on data privacy and AI governance.\nGiven this outlook, I anticipate some volatility in Microsoft\u2019s growth trajectory over the long term, though it may be less pronounced than that of semiconductor companies like NVIDIA (NVDA). Periodic price and valuation dips coinciding with temporarily lower growth rates could provide more attractive buying opportunities as sentiment fluctuates.\nThere is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure.\u00a0With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft\u2019s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations.\u00a0This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.\nIs Microsoft a Buy, Hold or Sell?\nOn Wall Street, Microsoft receives a broadly positive outlook, with 26 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and no Sell ratings. The average MSFT price target is $503.27, reflecting a 17.5% upside potential over the next 12 months.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nThis positive sentiment reinforces the view that now may be a prudent time to invest in Microsoft, given its strong market position and leadership in AI.\nKey Takeaway: Microsoft Is a Leading AI Investment\nI am bullish on Microsoft due to its leadership in AI, supported by its significant stake in OpenAI. Additionally, the company has demonstrated consistent free cash flow growth, which is likely to strengthen its market leadership over the long term. Although Meta is a strong competitor in the AI landscape, I remain confident that Microsoft holds the leading position. Based on my analysis, MSFT stock is a Buy.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

META, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. TMO and Food Comes From, Inc. WFCF.\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nTop Analyst Reports for Meta, Tesla and Thermo Fisher\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc., Tesla, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Where Food Comes From, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+64.0% vs. +23.5%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone.\n\nIt witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\n\nShares of Tesla have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (+12.0% vs. -1.4%). The company\u2019s long-term growth prospects remain strong, driven by its thriving Energy Generation & Storage segment, expansive Supercharger network and AI advancements. Energy deployments are expected to double this year, thanks to the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products.\n\nTesla\u2019s robust balance sheet, with a high liquidity buffer, supports continued innovation and expansion. Progress in the autonomous vehicle domain, including plans to launch robotaxi services in 2025, position the company well for sustained growth.\n\nHowever, near-term pressure from high capex, stiff EV competition and margin challenges in the automotive segment pose risks. Still, Tesla\u2019s commitment toward clean energy, along with its pioneering technology and robust infrastructure, underpins our bullish long-term view of the stock.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s shares have gained +27.4% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry\u2019s gain of +33.4%. The company is braving the ongoing tough economic conditions by utilizing the PPI Business System, resulting in strong financial performance.\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s growth strategy has been bolstered by several recent product launches, including a pre-transplant risk assessment assay and the international CorEvitas Adolescent Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Registry in the third quarter. The consistent efforts to expand its bioproduction business look encouraging.\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s continuous efforts to prioritize its partnership with customers to drive innovation and improve patient care bode well. A strong solvency position is an added advantage. The raised 2024 EPS outlook also raises optimism. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in Life.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here >>>)\n\nShares of Where Food Comes From have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Services - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-18.5% vs. +20.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $60.85 million demonstrates strong revenue growth in its core verification services, up 13% year over year to $9.7 million in the first half of 2024, driven by the rising demand for transparency in food production.\n\nExpansions into the Upcycled Food Certification and biosecurity services position WFCF for growth, capitalizing on sustainability trends. The company\u2019s diversified revenue streams mitigate risks from cyclical industry pressures, such as challenges in the beef sector.\n\nYet, declining product sales, particularly in RFID tags, and rising SG&A expenses, which increased 13% year over year in second-quarter 2024, pose risks to profitability. The cyclical downturn in the cattle industry continues to pressure WFCF\u2019s revenues.

[Trump would] tank our economy if he wins a second term.\"\n\"The Trump campaign has given Democrats a bit of a gift by highlighting Elon Musk,\" said Evan Roth Smith, a left-leaning pollster at a group called Blueprint who has looked at the billionaire's impact.\nHe said the idea of Trump being \"a stooge for the wealthy and corporate America\" is a top-performing message for Democrats among swing voters and it's a potential issue that \u201cdislodges some of these [Nikki] Haley Republicans who are skeptical of his tax policy.\u201d\nSmith has also polled perceptions of Musk personally, focused on young male voters, and found that even this group's views of Musk were decidedly mixed.\nThe poll asked whether Musk's endorsement makes \"you more or less likely to support Trump.\" 24% of respondents answered \"more likely,\" but slightly more, 28%, said \"less likely.\" A plurality of 45% said it would have no impact.\nThe results were even more stark among independent men of all ages, with 18% saying Musk moved them to Trump and 27% saying it moved them the other way.\nStory Continues\nA non-scientific survey of Yahoo Finance users last week came to a similar overall result: 25% of respondents said Musk made them more likely to vote for Trump, while almost 28% said he made them less likely.\nA focus on Musk in the home stretch\nFor Trump's part, he doesn't appear to be ratcheting down his Musk mentions at all.\nPraise for the CEO is a staple of rally appearances, and Musk was the final speaker Sunday before Trump's wife Melania took the stage at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\nThat was an appearance where Musk spoke about his plans for a \"Department of Government Efficiency\" if Trump wins and claimed the effort could save the US $2 trillion. He offered no details about how he would find such savings, which would represent more than all discretionary spending in the US budget.\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk exults as he steps on stage during a rally for Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden in New York on Oct. 27. (ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images\nIn addition to a possible role with Trump, Musk has been center stage on multiple other fronts in recent weeks in ways that could raise questions with voters.\nThere is growing evidence, in reports from both The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post released Tuesday, that the algorithm on Musk\u2019s social media site X, formerly Twitter, is being tilted toward conservative voices.\nMusk also still faces questions about another WSJ report that he is \"in regular contact\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nYet Musk has continued to command the spotlight with a steady stream of pro-Trump media posts and daily million-dollar giveaways to registered swing state voters that are now the subject of a lawsuit from Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nThe mix of issues has led the Harris campaign to go out of its way in recent weeks to highlight Musk's role. Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz called Musk Trump's \"running mate\" at a recent stop.\nOf course, many opinions are mixed on Musk's influence.\nPennsylvania Democratic Senator John Fetterman, who supports Harris and won a hard-fought contest in the commonwealth two years ago, underlined that Musk has a lot of appeal.\n\"I mean, to a lot of people, that's Tony Stark,\" he recently told the New York Times in reference to the \u201cIron Man\u201d protagonist. \"That's going to really matter.\"\nAn overall focus on billionaires\nThe focus in the home stretch of the campaign trail extends beyond Musk to a wide array of billionaires.\nTrump has brought up other prominent CEOs at recent stops, saying Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai have called him separately in recent days.\n\"Tim, I've got to get elected first,\" Trump said he told the Apple head about his concerns during a podcast interview with Patrick Bet-David.\nIt's unclear if those two tech CEOs are well-known enough to impact voters, but Smith noted that his polling has found that, while billionaire name checks can be a negative for Republicans among independents, they can be a positive for Democrats like Kamala Harris, whom Trump constantly attacks as anti-business.\n\"Democrats highlighting the support of people like Mark Cuban and other business leaders helps assuage some of those fears,\" he said.\nMark Cuban after speaking at a campaign rally for Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in La Crosse, Wis. on Oct. 17. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIndeed, his group's polling provides some evidence of that. One October poll asked voters about a potential message from Trump that began with \"Elon Musk is a fantastic guy.\"\nIt was the least popular among the 14 messages they tested.\nBy contrast, a more recent poll released just this week brought up another billionaire, Mark Cuban, and his argument that Donald Trump would be bad for the economy and Harris would be good for it.\nIt was much more popular among the swing state voters who will decide the election next week.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how US policy and government affect your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

It\u2019s a stretch to believe Tuesday\u2019s results will blow away those concerns.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThere Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC\u2019s Historic Meatpacking District\nInside NYC\u2019s Playbook for Getting Federal Grant Funds\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nBooming Cambridge Exposes England\u2019s Widening Wealth Gap\nThe Google parent\u2019s earnings, due after the close, are expected to show long-term growth trends remain intact. They could also offer new information about any tailwinds it is seeing from artificial intelligence.\nBut even a positive report may be overshadowed by worries over the unquantified cost of antitrust action, a headache dragging on the stock and making it inexpensive among tech megacaps. Plus, there will be scrutiny over whether Alphabet\u2019s dominant market share in internet search is at risk from other players in AI.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to shout out the company\u2019s valuation, but there are a lot of fears that are hard to quantify, which means you can\u2019t yet tell if it\u2019s a value or a value trap,\u201d said George Cipolloni, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. \u201cIt clearly looks cheap compared to the other Magnificent Seven, but you\u2019re being paid to take a lot of risk, relatively.\u201d\nAlphabet shares are up 2.2% over the past six months, the weakest performance among the megacaps. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index has risen 27% over that period. Shares of Alphabet rose 1.9% on Tuesday.\nAlphabet\u2019s results are expected to show revenue growth near 14% and net earnings expansion above 18%. Both these metrics are projected to hold above a double-digit pace over the subsequent years.\nThose healthy trends, coupled with Alphabet\u2019s more modest valuation, could mean a lower bar to clear this quarter. Jefferies wrote that Alphabet faces a \u201cless demanding set-up among megacaps\u201d going into earnings, and that the stock should \u201cgrind higher over time, driven by fundamentals, though fighting regulatory/antitrust headwinds.\u201d\nThe shares trade at 19 times estimated earnings, the cheapest among the Magnificent Seven cohort, and a discount to its 10-year average. In contrast, Microsoft Corp., the other major AI software play, trades near 31 times.\nAlphabet\u2019s fundamentals and valuation discount stand out among big tech, where investors are increasingly wary about the long-term growth outlook and demanding share-price multiples.\nStory Continues\nHowever, the discount also reflects the idiosyncratic risks confronting Alphabet. Antitrust regulation has emerged as a central headwind, ever since a federal judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search market.\nEarlier this month, the Justice Department told a federal judge it\u2019s considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations. While that is seen as unlikely, and Alphabet is expected to appeal more extreme punishments, the uncertainty could remain a long-term overhang.\nAlphabet is also among companies allocating billions of dollars to AI-related capital expenditure, something investors are increasingly wanting to see pay off in terms of improved growth and efficiency. Higher-than-expected spending was a reason the stock sold off in the wake of last quarter\u2019s results.\nWhile AI has boosted demand for the company\u2019s cloud-computing services, Alphabet is also on the defensive protecting its internet search market share from AI alternatives.\nNearly 80% of the company\u2019s 2023 revenue came from Google advertising, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Less than 11% was derived from Google cloud. On Monday, the Information reported that Meta Platforms Inc. is working on developing an AI search engine to reduce its dependence on Google.\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling to know how to handicap these overhangs, since I doubt judges will give Alphabet that lenient a path, and we don\u2019t know whether any erosion in market share will be manageable,\u201d said Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. \u201cThese concerns are becoming more real than ever in terms of impacting fundamentals.\u201d\nRoughly 83% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying Alphabet, a positive consensus that is nevertheless below megacap peers like Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., or Nvidia Corp., all of which have ratios near or above 90%. However, the average analyst price target points to upside near 20% for Alphabet over the coming 12 months, the highest among megacaps.\n\u201cThe regulatory headwind is unlikely to be removed in the near term, but in the meantime, Alphabet is a high-quality asset trading at a discount to the market even though it is outgrowing the market,\u201d Stucky said. \u201cThat\u2019s a reason to stick with it.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nApple Inc.\u2019s iPhone exports from India jumped by a third in the six months through September, underscoring its push to expand manufacturing in the country and reduce dependence on China.\nNEC Corp. plans to take its subsidiary NEC Networks & System Integration Corp. private, buying all the remaining shares in the company that it doesn\u2019t already own for as much as \u00a5235.5 billion ($1.5 billion).\nLiberal Democratic Party heavyweight Akira Amari\u2019s defeat in Japan\u2019s general election removes from parliament one of the chip sector\u2019s biggest advocates as concerns grow over the amount of taxpayer money getting plowed into the industry.\nThe Biden administration finalized restrictions on investments by US individuals and companies into advanced technology in China, including semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.\nApple Inc., heralding a \u201cnew era\u201d for its devices, started rolling out its first set of Apple Intelligence features and introduced a new 24-inch iMac desktop with an AI-focused M4 processor.\nIndian food-delivery platform Swiggy Ltd. is seeking to sell shares for as much as 390 rupees ($4.64) each in an initial public offering that may raise $1.35 billion, people familiar with the matter said.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nPremarket\nCorning\nZebra Tech\nCommVault\nIPG Photonics\nCTS\nPerfect\nShutterstock\nPostmarket\nAlphabet\nAMD\nElectronic Arts\nLiberty Global\nATN International\nSnap\nQorvo\nVaronis Systems\nLittelfuse\nMirion Technologies\nPros Holdings\nUnisys\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to afternoon trading.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\n\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle.\n\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $25.759 billion, suggesting 15.4% growth on a year-over-year basis.\nApple\u2019s Mac Sales to Fall Y/Y\nApple\u2019s Mac shipment is expected to have plunged 24.2% year over year in the third quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 5.3 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 7.8% compared with 10% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple\u2019s estimated shipment decline rate is the largest in IDC\u2019s vendor list, followed by Dell Technologies DELL, whose shipment declined 4%.

In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 62.9 million units, down 1.3% year over year. In Gartner\u2019s list, Acer Group gains the most in terms of shipments (up 4.4%), as well as market share (7.3% versus 6.9% in the year-ago quarter), followed by Apple (shipments up 3.5%).\nStory Continues\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector, Beat Industry\nApple shares have returned 21.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 26.3% but beating the Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry\u2019s 20.9%.\nYear-to-Date Performance Chart\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio, AAPL is trading at 30.06X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 26.44X.\nPrice/Earnings Ratio (P/E F12M)\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAI Focus Aids AAPL\u2019s Prospects\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nApple\u2019s AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul.\n\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\n\nApple Intelligence will be first available in U.S. English and will be expanded quickly to include localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the U.K. in December.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nTom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management Group, states that the two things to look for in the earnings season are consumer spending and companies' spending on technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Recent reports from the financial sector and retailers suggest that consumers are in good financial shape, setting the stage for a promising holiday season as well as providing a solid opportunity for growth in the fourth quarter. He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nSometimes, these AI-related names are a bit overvalued and there is volatility; but the long-term thesis remains strong. In fact, these \u201cdown days\u201d can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major \u201cAI arms race\u201d is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings.\nJust like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn\u2019t surprised by recent market developments. It\u2019s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is \u201ceasy to hope\u201d that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, \u201creaffirms that confidence\u201d.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents.\n\u201cWe think every company in the world, whether it\u2019s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.\u201d -Taylor told CNBC in an interview.\nIn other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo\u2019s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both.\n\"Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety.\" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company\u2019s Master Perfumer\nAdvancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI\u2019s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company:\n\u201cNeither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\u201d.\nWith that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (\nsee more details here\n).\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Launches Apple Intelligence AI Tools for iPhone, Enhancing User Experience with Advanced Features\nPixabay/Public Domain\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American technology company engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide.

Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s personal intelligence system, is a suite of software tools that brings what the company describes as artificial intelligence to its devices.

Apple Intelligence is also available on Mac computers and iPad tablets that are powered by its latest chips.\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with CROX.\nThe iPhone 16, which was released in September, has not been approved for domestic advertising since Apple has not put down the required investment to warrant certification. This decision makes sense in light of Indonesia's efforts to court overseas investors and develop advanced manufacturing capabilities in the country, specializing in technology devices. Even though Indonesians are young and have easy access to modern technology products, there is no proprietary store set up by Apple, with the general rule that they have to buy products from third-party sellers.\nThe restriction only touches the fret of bringing into the country the new model for commerce sale; it does not bar individual raw iPhone 16 users from importing the device for personal use in the country. It indicated that only approximately 9,000 units of iPhone 16 have been imported into Indonesia, although the market prospect in a nation with nearly 280 million people is huge.\nThis compliance issue emerged at a time when Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, was seeking huge investments in Southeast Asia to diversify the Company's supply chain, which is mainly dependent on China. The emergence also reveals the nature of competition the smartphone market in Indonesia has at the moment, instrumental by players like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and Samsung, amongst others.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) week of announcements continued Tuesday as the company took the wraps off of its newest Mac mini desktop computer and all-new M4 Pro chip, just ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season.\nThe news comes after Apple debuted its updated iMac desktop, complete with the company\u2019s M4 chip, on Monday.\nShares of Apple were flat following the news.\nThe Mac mini, which is available for preorder today and on sale Nov. 8, starts at $599 and features a significantly smaller design, measuring just 5 inches by 5 inches, down from 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches. Despite the smaller footprint, Apple says the latest mini gets more horsepower than its predecessor.\nBesides the obvious holiday rush, the recent announcements come at an important time as the company moves to keep its momentum going.\nApple\u2019s Mac segment struggled in 2023, following a blowout in 2022 caused by pandemic-driven spending among consumers and enterprise customers on computers and smartphones, with revenue falling from $40.1 billion in 2022 to $29.3 billion in 2023.\nBut sales have begun to normalize, with Apple reporting Mac revenue of $22.2 billion over the first nine months of the fiscal year versus $21.7 billion during the same period last year. In Q3, Mac revenue totaled $7 billion, up from $6.8 billion last year.\nApple's latest Mac mini gets the company's M4 chip along with its new M4 Pro processor just ahead of the holiday shopping season. (Image: Apple) \u00b7 Apple\nPC shipments, more broadly, are steadily recovering after two years of declines following the jump in growth at the onset of the pandemic. According to Gartner, shipments of Apple\u2019s Macs grew 3.5% in the third quarter from 5.4 million last year to 5.6 million this year.\nApple\u2019s pint-sized desktop features a bevy of connections and ports, making it more useful for consumers and enterprise users who need to hook up various peripherals including expanded storage and tools for photo editing. That includes an ethernet jack, HDMI port, three USB-C Thunderbolt slots in the rear of the mini, and two USB-C ports up front, along with a headphone jack.\nInside, Apple has outfitted the base Mac mini with its M4 chip and 16GB of memory, up from the M2 processor and 8GB of memory found in the prior generation of minis. Apple says the M4-powered mini\u2019s central processing unit (CPU) is up to 1.8x faster than the CPU found in the M1-powered model. The M4\u2019s graphics processing unit (GPU), meanwhile, is 2.2x faster than the M1 mini's GPU.\nThe rear of the new Mac mini features Thunderbolt, HDMI, and ethernet ports. (Image: Apple) \u00b7 Apple\nIn addition to the new Mac mini, Apple also revealed its M4 Pro chip. A more powerful version of the M4, Apple says the M4 Pro features a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, and 16-core neural engine and can be equipped with up to 64GB of memory. Apple says a Mac mini with the M4 Pro is twice as fast as a mini running the company\u2019s older M2 Pro chip.\nStory Continues\nApple is rolling out the M4 chips just as it launches its Apple Intelligence platform for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The software, which Apple will update with new features throughout the rest of 2024 and 2025, includes options like notification summaries, AI-powered writing tools, and photo editing capabilities.\nWhile Apple says M1-based Macs will be able to run Apple Intelligence, the speedier M4 chips and larger amount of base memory should help on-device AI applications run faster, especially when it comes to video and photo apps.\nI\u2019ve been using a beta version of Apple Intelligence for the past few weeks, and while I haven\u2019t found much opportunity to use the photo editing or writing tools, notification summaries have been a huge help in getting my deluge of texts, Slacks, and news updates under control.\nStill, Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t a must-have quite yet. That may happen when the company releases its next batch of Apple Intelligence features later this year, including ChatGPT integration with Siri and Apple\u2019s Visual Intelligence.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

With M4, Mac mini can support up to two 6K displays and up to one 5K display, and with M4 Pro, it can support up to three 6K displays at 60Hz for a total of over 60 million pixels.\nA New Era with Apple Intelligence on the Mac\nApple Intelligence ushers in a new era for the Mac, bringing personal intelligence to the personal computer. Combining powerful generative models with industry-first privacy protections, Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine to unlock new ways for users to work, communicate, and express themselves on Mac. It is available in U.S. English with macOS Sequoia 15.1. With systemwide Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write. With the newly redesigned Siri\u00ae, users can move fluidly between spoken and typed requests to accelerate tasks throughout their day, and Siri can answer thousands of questions about Mac and other Apple products. New Apple Intelligence features will be available in December, with additional capabilities rolling out in the coming months. Image Playground gives users a new way to create fun original images, and Genmoji\u2122 allows them to create custom emoji in seconds. Siri will become even more capable, with the ability to take actions across the system and draw on a user\u2019s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. In December, ChatGPT will be integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, allowing users to access its expertise without needing to jump between tools.\nApple Intelligence does all this while protecting users\u2019 privacy at every step. At its core is on-device processing, and for more complex tasks, Private Cloud Compute gives users access to Apple\u2019s even larger, server-based models and offers groundbreaking protections for personal information. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in \u2014 their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won\u2019t store requests. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI\u2019s data-use policies apply.\nThe First Carbon Neutral Mac\nThe new Mac mini is Apple\u2019s first carbon neutral Mac, marking a significant milestone toward Apple 2030, the company\u2019s goal to be carbon neutral across the entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade.\nMac mini is made with over 50 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Apple-designed printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. The electricity used to manufacture Mac mini is sourced from 100 percent renewable electricity. And, to address 100 percent of the electricity customers use to power Mac mini, Apple has invested in clean energy projects around the world. Apple has also prioritized lower-carbon modes of shipping, like ocean freight, to further reduce emissions from transportation. Together, these actions have reduced the carbon footprint of Mac mini by over 80 percent.2 For the small amount of remaining emissions, Apple applies high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects, like those generated by its innovative Restore Fund.\nIn another first for Mac mini, the packaging is now entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal to remove plastic from its packaging by 2025.\nAn Unrivaled Experience with macOS Sequoia\nmacOS\u00ae Sequoia completes the new Mac mini experience with a host of exciting features, including iPhone\u00ae Mirroring, allowing users to wirelessly interact with their iPhone, its apps, and notifications directly from their Mac.7 Safari\u00ae, the world\u2019s fastest browser,8 now offers the Highlights feature, which quickly pulls up relevant information from a site; a smarter, redesigned Reader with a table of contents and high-level summary; and a new Video Viewer to watch videos without distractions. With Distraction Control, users can hide items on a webpage that they may find disruptive to their browsing. Gaming gets even more immersive with features like Personalized Spatial Audio and improvements to Game Mode, along with a breadth of exciting titles, including the upcoming Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows. Easier window tiling means users can stay organized with a window layout that works best for them. The all-new Passwords app gives convenient access to passwords, passkeys, and other credentials \u2014 all stored in one place. And users can apply new, beautiful built-in backgrounds for video calls, which include a variety of color gradients and system wallpapers, or upload their own photos.\nPricing and Availability\nCustomers can pre-order the new Mac mini with M4 and M4 Pro starting today, Tuesday, October 29, on apple.com/store and in the Apple Store\u00ae app in 28 countries and regions, including the U.S. It will start arriving to customers, and in Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Resellers, beginning Friday, November 8.\nMac mini with M4 starts at $599 (U.S.) and $499 (U.S.) for education.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nTom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management Group, states that the two things to look for in the earnings season are consumer spending and companies' spending on technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Recent reports from the financial sector and retailers suggest that consumers are in good financial shape, setting the stage for a promising holiday season as well as providing a solid opportunity for growth in the fourth quarter. He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nSometimes, these AI-related names are a bit overvalued and there is volatility; but the long-term thesis remains strong. In fact, these \u201cdown days\u201d can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major \u201cAI arms race\u201d is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings.\nJust like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn\u2019t surprised by recent market developments. It\u2019s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is \u201ceasy to hope\u201d that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, \u201creaffirms that confidence\u201d.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents.\n\u201cWe think every company in the world, whether it\u2019s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.\u201d -Taylor told CNBC in an interview.\nIn other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo\u2019s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both.\n\"Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety.\" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company\u2019s Master Perfumer\nAdvancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI\u2019s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company:\n\u201cNeither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\u201d.\nWith that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (\nsee more details here\n).\nRay Wang on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN): Strong Fundamentals Amid AI Competition Challenges\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American multinational technology company offering e-commerce, cloud computing, and other services, including digital streaming and artificial intelligence solutions. The company uses artificial intelligence for everything from reinventing shopping experiences to automated ad creatives, streamlining healthcare access, and powering the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.\nOn Monday, October 28, investor Ray Wang talked about Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on CNBC\u2019s Money Movers.

He highlighted Amazon.com Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising revenue, growing at a 20% annual rate, which is allowing the company to catch up to Google\u2019s ad revenue numbers. Moreover, the company\u2019s massive cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, provides it the flexibility it needs to explore AI integration across its operations. Amazon Prime Video platform is a strong competitor to Netflix as well. Despite all these positives, it is also true that the company is trailing behind its peers in AI capabilities.\n\u201cThe bright side is they\u2019re done with their big CapEx investments into their data centers, whereas Microsoft has a lot of CapEx investment to do and Google has to play a lot of catch up. So Amazon has a little bit of time to get their AI story right\u201d. -Investor Ray Wang\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

They explained that although the stock has seen a nominal rise of 6.7%, it represents a negative 7% return when adjusted for inflation, lagging behind the S&P 500 and competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\nIn the letter, Blue Duck outlined several recommendations to revive the stock's performance.\nKey proposals include initiating a major capital return program to align with Amazon's market cap and free cash flow, expanding efforts to capitalize on the growing health food movement through Whole Foods, and scrutinizing media investments.\nThe firm says Amazon must adopt a shareholder-friendly strategy, including buybacks, to offset dilution from stock-based compensation. Blue Duck stated, referencing comparisons to Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet's shareholder returns.\nThe letter also raised concerns about Amazon's AI spending, urging the company to provide more transparency in simple terms.\nBlue Duck argued that Amazon's complex messaging could be alienating investors.\nAdditionally, the fund criticized recent decisions in Amazon Studios, including the controversial \"Rings of Power\" series, and warned against further \"unforced errors\" in content investments.\nThe letter concluded by encouraging Amazon's board to realign its strategies and suggested that such changes could drive the stock to over $250 per share within a year.\nRelated Articles\nDuck Capital calls for 'significant' capital return at Amazon\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley CEOs see more dealmaking in 2025\nAdidas sees strong sales in China as it opens more stores\nView Comments"

Quote\nFactors to Note\nA strong cloud services portfolio and expanding generative AI capabilities are expected to have aided the performance of AWS in the third quarter.\n\nIn the quarter under review, AWS announced the general availability of its new managed service called AWS Parallel Computing Service, which enables customers to build scientific and engineering models and seamlessly manage high-performance computing infrastructure.\n\nAmazon launched AWS GenAI Lofts, collaborative spaces and immersive experiences for startups and developers, offering key AI hotspots, workshops and hands-on programming from AI experts, community groups and AWS partners.\n\nAmazon introduced AWS App Studio, a generative AI-powered service that uses natural language to create enterprise-grade applications. The service allows technical professionals without software development skills to quickly build secure, fully managed applications, thereby reducing operational expertise and allowing them to focus on business problem-solving.\n\nOn the back of portfolio strength, AWS is likely to have witnessed solid customer momentum in the third quarter. AWS teamed up with Digital Domain to scale the latter's Autonomous Virtual Human Technology and help in introducing Generative AI-powered features.\n\nAWS was selected by the Central Japan Railway Company. The latter is using AWS' Internet of Things, machine learning (ML) and GenAI capabilities to drive efficient operations for its next-generation, high-speed train service.\n\nAWS was picked by Gold Fields GFI. The latter shifted its end-to-end SAP and treasury systems to AWS. Gold Fields is also leveraging AWS\u2019 analytics, ML and GenAI solutions to modernize technology infrastructure.\n\nAmazon partnered with GE HealthCare GEHC to allow the latter to use its healthcare and generative AI services to help clinicians improve medical diagnostics and patient care.\n\nAWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock. In the third quarter, AWS entered into a five-year partnership with Smarsh. Per the terms, the latter strives to enhance its offerings for the financial services industry by leveraging Amazon Bedrock.\n\nWe note that the strengthening customer base is likely to have driven AWS' top-line growth in the third quarter. It is also expected to have aided Amazon, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), in sustaining its cloud dominance against its strong contenders like Microsoft and Alphabet GOOGL.

The foundation of the strategy is a rigorous bottoms-up, risk/reward discipline that uncovers mispriced global equities across all market caps. The Fund's diligence process tends to underweight traditional 'sell-side' broker research and mainstream financial media and instead makes heavy use of primary sources. This tends to produce a return stream that has a low correlation with the S&P 500. The Fund manages risk by balancing exposures, using modest leverage, and adhering to proprietary risk/reward levels.

The firm's revenue estimates are 6% and 8% ahead of the consensus for those years, respectively.\nThe anticipated integration with Netflix and Roku is expected to contribute approximately 400 basis points to The Trade Desk's gross spend growth in 2025, positioning the company's revenues ahead of consensus.\nThe firm also notes that The Trade Desk is likely to continue gaining market share from Google's DV360 in the medium term due to Alphabet's legal challenges.\n\u201cIn our view, the biggest benefit from ad-tech legal challenges at Alphabet/Google is likely to be underinvestment&lack of focus, rather than pot'l business model or industry structure changes,\u201d analysts continued.\nSeparately, Citi analysts said they expect \u201canother strong beat and raise quarter\u201d from TTD, noting that key growth drivers including CTV, Retail Media, and market share gains remain intact.

That has prompted charges of mismanagement from the lessor providing the aircraft.\nElbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW), a joint venture between aircraft manufacturer Airbus and Singapore Technologies Engineering, promised to deliver 10 rebuilt Airbus A330-300 widebody jets by the fourth quarter for use by Amazon\u2019s private cargo airline. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has received six of the A330 cargo jets since September 2023 and placed them with Hawaiian Airlines to fly in its domestic air distribution network under a 10-year transportation services agreement.\nIn an interview earlier this year, EFW Chief Executive Jordi Boto acknowledged shortcomings with the production process at sites in San Antonio and Mobile, Alabama, which he attributed to subpar training and workforce shortages stemming from the lingering effects of aviation industry layoffs during the COVID crisis. He said the company planned to relocate freighter conversion work to facilities in Asia and Europe until training and recruiting could be brought up to standard.\nFinal work is being carried out on the remaining aircraft at both modification sites, and no more conversions will be carried out in San Antonio and Mobile in 2025, EFW spokeswoman Anke Lemke said in an email last week.\n\n\nAmazon is leasing the Airbus cargo jets from Seattle-based Altavair, which owns the aircraft and contracted with EFW to retrofit them for carrying shipping containers on the main deck.\nAltavair CEO Steve Rimmer said EFW\u2019s problems mostly resulted from a deliberate decision to prioritize ST Engineering\u2019s more lucrative airline maintenance and repair work at the U.S. production sites, not supply chain disruptions plaguing the entire aircraft manufacturing and conversion industry. ST Engineering\u2019s commercial aerospace unit is a global provider of maintenance, repair and overhaul services (MRO) for aircraft, engines and components.\nRimmer accused EFW of protecting a majority shareholder\u2019s interests over customers when it moved skilled labor from the Mobile conversion line to fill gaps at ST Engineering\u2019s next-door maintenance shop and Airbus\u2019 manufacturing plant for A220 and A320 family passenger jets as airline operations recovered and demand for aircraft increased.\n\u201cThey saw an opportunity as Airbus\u2019 production lines in Mobile started gearing up again to rent labor to Airbus. Conversion customers were clearly left behind in the dust. The skilled labor is there. They\u2019ve just chosen to allocate it to other higher-yielding things,\u201d Rimmer told FreightWaves in a phone interview.\nStory Continues\n\n\nHe characterized the Mobile operation as \u201can unmitigated disaster.\u201d\nAn EFW machinest works to remodel an Airbus passenger jet for dedicated cargo service. (Photo: EFW)\nMRO companies typically charge about $250 an hour for maintenance compared to $180 an hour for conversions. Tearing down and rebuilding an A330-300 for cargo service costs more than $20 million, not including additional maintenance, and takes about four months under normal conditions, experts say.\nST Engineering\u2019s facility in San Antonio does MRO work and cargo conversions of A321 narrowbody aircraft. EFW also has production lines at its headquarters in Dresden, Germany, and Singapore, as well as third-party sites in Istanbul and in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin, China.\nA representative with another EFW customer, who asked not to be identified so as not to jeopardize ongoing business ties, said the conversion process in Mobile \u201cwas a horrible experience\u201d that involved late deliveries, invoices that were 40% to 50% higher than initial estimates and poor communication.\nEFW\u2019s customer list includes AerCap (lessor), BBAM (lessor), Air China Cargo, Air Transport Services Group (U.S. freighter operator and lessor), DHL Aviation, CDB Aviation (lessor, part of China Development Bank), Turkey-based MNG Airlines, Qantas, and SmartLynx Airlines.\nEach A330 for Amazon has been delivered about six months late. Rimmer said the remaining aircraft should be delivered by the end of the first quarter.\nHow the delays have impacted Amazon is difficult to quantify. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment about the A330 deliveries. But Hawaiian Airlines has hired new pilots and maintenance technicians who can\u2019t generate revenue yet without a full complement of freighters. Aviation experts say airlines need at least six to eight cargo planes for optimal operating efficiency and spare capacity when repairs are conducted. Amazon likely would want to carefully coordinate routes operated by A330s and its Boeing 767 and 737 aircraft to minimize capacity mismatches and delays.\nLabor challenges\nDemand for all-cargo aircraft spiked during the pandemic when shipping activity surged and the grounding of most passenger flights eliminated some 50% of global air cargo capacity. Shippers experienced capacity shortages and high rates during the airline industry\u2019s slow recovery in 2021 and 2022. Leasing companies that lost revenues because passenger assets were grounded hurried to repurpose narrowbody aircraft as freighters and speculative investors entered the conversion market for the first time.\n\n\nModifying a passenger jet for dedicated cargo operations is a complex process in which the aircraft is stripped to the bones and retrofitted with a ruggedized interior, reinforced flooring and bulkheads to support heavy containers, a large cargo door, a cockpit barrier, and new wiring.\nThe global economic shutdown during the pandemic created massive dislocation up and down the supply chain, with factories at limited capacity, port congestion, vessels off schedule, overcrowded warehouses and empty store shelves. Most companies laid off workers during the crisis and then had trouble restaffing when business picked up.\nAmazon\u2019s first A330 freighter, operated by Hawaiian Airlines, gets a water cannon salute from the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky airport as it departs on its first commercial flight in early October 2023. (Photo: Amazon)\nThe aerospace industry has struggled to fully recover. Some suppliers went out of business. Aircraft manufacturers and repair facilities experienced huge delays for parts and raw materials through 2023 and let go of skilled employees they didn\u2019t think would be needed. Many workers left the industry for other jobs and never came back. Other industries, especially the defense industry after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, poached aircraft machinists with offers of better pay and work conditions.\nBoto said EFW\u2019s assembly facilities in San Antonio and Mobile were hard-hit by the shortage of trained technicians at the same time the workload was increasing. With work quality and production rates suffering, the decision was made to transfer conversions to EFW facilities in other parts of the world. The company intends to bring back conversions to the U.S. in three or four years once it revamps the entire production and labor process, including recruiting and training, and figures out how to create a strong work culture rooted in quality. The best way to attract and keep good technicians is to set up a training academy or work with technical schools, he said.\n\u201cYou have to invest in training. \u2026 Conversion is the highest level of complexity that an operator can have,\u201d because technicians must have the flexibility to deal with imperfections in a 15- or 20-year-old plane, such as corrosion, that a machinist doesn\u2019t encounter when building a plane from scratch, said Boto.\nEFW needs to do a better job of providing management support to partner facilities and monitoring their progress, he acknowledged.\n\u201cWe have to change the way we support the sites. [Before,] we were delivering them the job cards, the technical documentation and the conversion kits. Now we have to be much more on-site. We have to send work parties to fully train them and work alongside them in critical phases of the conversion. We learned that. So we are rediscovering, a little bit \u2013 the whole business, actually,\u201d said Boto.\nSending conversion work to Europe and Asia makes sense, because many current customers are in Asia and it allows ST Engineering to concentrate on its MRO business, the EFW chief explained. Also, production of the A321 has slowed as passenger airlines hold on to aircraft longer because Boeing, Airbus and engine makers are dealing with their own delays related to supply chain and quality issues, which means there is less feedstock of used aircraft to repurpose for cargo conversions.\nFrayed relationship\nEFW communicated openly with Altavair and other customers as soon as delays were obvious so they had time to find other aircraft to fill a need on a temporary basis, according to Boto. Fitting reallocated planes into a new repair facility requires extensive negotiations to persuade customers to either move up or move back reservation slots and ensure suppliers can deliver parts ahead of schedule, he said.\nAltavair negotiated with Airbus to buy four new A330-300 jets that were built for Hainan Airlines in China and never delivered, and bought the other six used aircraft from Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways.\nThe lessor selected EFW in 2022 to overhaul the Airbus A330s, because it was viewed as a subsidiary of the original equipment manufacturer and ST Engineering had a long track record as a reputable retrofit outfit. Rival Israel Aircraft Industries was new to A330 conversions and farming out some jobs to third-party installers. Relying on Airbus\u2019 conversion program had the advantage of full access to Airbus\u2019 original design data, fully integrated manuals and maintenance support that independent conversion shops don\u2019t have. EFW was best positioned to meet Amazon\u2019s requirement to have all 10 planes in service by the 2024 peak season, said Rimmer.\nFrom the outset, ST Engineering fell behind in supplying pieces of EFW conversion kits to the Mobile production line\nThe ST Engineering maintenance, repair and overhaul facility in San Antonio, Texas, includes a hangar for cargo conversions (right foreground). ST Engineering will suspend conversion work there by the end of the year. (Photo: ST Engineering)\n\u201cAs a shareholder in EFW, you should be looking and saying, what\u2019s the impact of these actions on my clients? And that didn\u2019t happen. They just stepped back and claimed that they couldn\u2019t influence things,\u201d Altavair\u2019s CEO said.\nEFW\u2019s problems appear to be limited to U.S. facilities. Rimmer said one of its aircraft was inducted at a Chinese installation site that had never done an A330 conversion before and was finished ahead of schedule.\n\u201cIt demonstrates that if you\u2019re committed you can get it done.

          "whole_article": "Microsoft (MSFT) is at the forefront of the AI arms race, boasting an exceptional business model that consistently generates substantial and growing free cash flow. With the company\u2019s current valuation appearing fair, now may be an opportune time to buy its shares. I have a 12-month price target of $482.40, while the average Wall Street price target is $503.27. Therefore, I am decidedly bullish on MSFT stock, both in the short and long term.\nMicrosoft Should Not Be Underestimated in AI\nI am particularly bullish on Microsoft because it is widely recognized as a global leader in AI. Based on my analysis, Microsoft is likely at the forefront of the AI market, as demonstrated by its $10 billion commitment to ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This investment has enabled groundbreaking products like\u00a0Microsoft Copilot,\u00a0which integrates AI into its Office suite to improve productivity for millions of users. Notably, ChatGPT reached one million users in less than five days and 100 million users in about two months\u2014a feat of unprecedented growth.\nFurthermore, Microsoft, alongside partners like BlackRock (BLK), is involved in the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, which aims to raise up to $100 billion to develop data centers and energy infrastructure supporting AI operations. This partnership aligns with Microsoft\u2019s long-term strategy to lead the global AI industry. In the medium term, investors can anticipate growth driven by AI integrated into Microsoft\u2019s cloud services (Azure).\nHowever, the industry is crowded with Big Tech competitors, including Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and the unexpected outperformer Meta (META). Among these, I consider Meta to pose the most significant competitive threat to Microsoft, as it has open-sourced its frontier AI models, enabling third parties to iterate on the source code and advance the technology more rapidly\u2014a strategy Microsoft has not adopted.\nMSFT Stock Is Attractive for Growth Investors\nOne of the primary reasons I view Microsoft as an outstanding long-term investment is its robust history of generating substantial free cash flow. At the time of this writing, the company\u2019s free cash flow margin exceeds 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last trailing 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments.\nWhile Microsoft may not appear as a value investment, it is reasonably priced, in my view, given its consistent revenue and earnings growth, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. I estimate a 13% normalized EPS growth over the next 12 months. Based on this forecast, I hold a price target of $482.40, estimating the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of approximately 36.\nStory Continues\nLooking further ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next five to 10 years. While this outlook requires purchasing the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price presents an opportunity. The company\u2019s forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only a 6.5% premium over its five-year average, while its forward diluted EPS growth rate has expanded by nearly the same amount, at 5.8%.\nMSFT Faces Potential Headwinds in the Long Term\nOne potential challenge to Microsoft\u2019s long-term growth in AI is that its adoption may be cyclical. Currently, demand for AI systems is high, prompting Microsoft and other Big Tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks\u2014potentially due to macroeconomic constraints\u2014a slowdown in growth is likely.\u00a0According to the TipRanks Risk Analysis tool, Microsoft faces 32% of its risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is above the sector average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny on data privacy and AI governance.\nGiven this outlook, I anticipate some volatility in Microsoft\u2019s growth trajectory over the long term, though it may be less pronounced than that of semiconductor companies like NVIDIA (NVDA). Periodic price and valuation dips coinciding with temporarily lower growth rates could provide more attractive buying opportunities as sentiment fluctuates.\nThere is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure.\u00a0With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft\u2019s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations.\u00a0This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.\nIs Microsoft a Buy, Hold or Sell?\nOn Wall Street, Microsoft receives a broadly positive outlook, with 26 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and no Sell ratings. The average MSFT price target is $503.27, reflecting a 17.5% upside potential over the next 12 months.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nThis positive sentiment reinforces the view that now may be a prudent time to invest in Microsoft, given its strong market position and leadership in AI.\nKey Takeaway: Microsoft Is a Leading AI Investment\nI am bullish on Microsoft due to its leadership in AI, supported by its significant stake in OpenAI. Additionally, the company has demonstrated consistent free cash flow growth, which is likely to strengthen its market leadership over the long term. Although Meta is a strong competitor in the AI landscape, I remain confident that Microsoft holds the leading position. Based on my analysis, MSFT stock is a Buy.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

Last week, the Tesla stock jumped about 23% primarily due to margin improvement and an upbeat outlook (read: Tesla Records its Best Day in 11 Years: 5 ETF Winners).\nDespite this surge, Wall Street remains divided over Tesla's place in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d \u2014 a group of market-dominating tech giants, including NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Microsoft MSFT and Tesla (read: Is Tesla's Stock Pop Sustainable? TSLA ETFs in Focus).\nAs the third-quarter earnings season kicks off, the Magnificent Seven is anticipated to record 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth, with NVIDIA, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta among the top contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, per FactSet, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nTesla\u2019s Earnings Rebound Yet Leave Analysts Skeptical\nTesla\u2019s third-quarter profits showed a 17% jump, a meaningful rebound after two quarters of decline. However, analysts remain cautious about Tesla\u2019s long-term position among Big Tech, citing concerns that its fundamentals may be overhyped.\nWe would like to note that Tesla\u2019s delivery numbers fell short of estimates in the past. Tesla has been losing market share to its rivals in both China and the United States, resulting in a notable slowdown in growth. This month itself we have seen Tesla\u2019s unimpressive robotaxi event, which failed to meet expectations, raising concerns among ridesharing investors.\nValuation Concerns Add to Tesla\u2019s Strained Standing\nTesla\u2019s pricey valuation further complicates its status within the Magnificent Seven. Although higher growth tends to demand a higher valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 115.54, Tesla\u2019s valuation far exceeds its tech peers.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalyst sentiment reflects this caution. Tesla currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.96 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 2.89 a month ago based on 38 recommendations.\nOf the 39 recommendations deriving the current ABR, Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 23.08% and 5.13%. It is the lowest approval rate within the Magnificent Seven.\nTesla\u2019s Stock Price Target\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 35 analysts, the average price target for Tesla comes to $206.22. The forecasts range from a low of $24.86 to a high of $310.00. The average price target represents a decline of 23.4% from the last closing price of $269.19 as on Oct. 25.\nStory Continues\nCould Netflix be a More Suitable Candidate?\nAs Tesla\u2019s standing falters, streaming giant Netflix NFLX has emerged as a possible replacement, thanks to its strong earnings, subscriber growth, improving free cash flow and solid guidance. Year to date, Netflix stock has surged by 55%, trailing only NVIDIA and Meta among the Magnificent Seven.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWealth Enhancement Group\u2019s Ayako Yoshioka believes Netflix is an appealing alternative due to its strong earnings and solid guidance. Bank of America loves its free cash flow strength, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Same is the view of Portfolio Wealth Advisors\u2019 Jesus Alvarado-Martinez.\nWith free cash flow reaching $2.19 billion in Q3, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier, Netflix\u2019s cash flow has been rising steadily since the pandemic. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich projects Netflix\u2019s free cash flow to hit $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nBroker Rating on Netflix Stock\nOf the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR of Netflix shares, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.5% and 5% of all recommendations. The Netflix stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has an upbeat VGM Score of B. Netflix shares trade at a forward P/E of 37.88X versus 105.6X forward P/E possessed by the underlying Broadcast Radio and Television.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNetflix-Heavy ETFs in Focus\nInvestors who believe that Netflix shares deserve a spot in the tech elite club may play the stock in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) form, too.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks to buy before they split next.\nS&P 500: Targeting 6,000 Amid Market Optimism\nThere\u2019s been a notable sense of fear among investors despite the market\u2019s current strong performance. The upcoming weeks are expected to be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and an impending election, alongside uncertainty regarding the Fed\u2019s next moves. But the fact remains that the market has shown resilience, with numerous new highs for major indices this year, although investors remain skeptical. Historically, volatility tends to increase after elections as political changes take effect. Currently, volatility is relatively low but is anticipated to rise as January approaches and clarity about potential policy impacts emerges.\nDespite prevailing uncertainties, there remains cautious optimism about the market\u2019s ability to maintain its upward trajectory. In mid-October, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC to the skepticism displayed by investors. We covered his sentiment in our article about the\u00a08 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now:\n\u201cKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents\u2019 experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nAround the same time, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss the market trends as well. On October 14, Mary Ann Bartels highlighted that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, she acknowledged that while this target is achievable, the journey may not be smooth.\nStory Continues\nBartels noted that there could be volatility ahead, as evidenced by increased hedging activity in the market. However, she remains optimistic due to the Fed\u2019s shift towards an easier monetary policy and the ongoing economic growth, which is supported by full employment, albeit with a slight slowdown in job creation. Importantly, she highlighted that corporate profits are on the rise, with earnings currently beating expectations by about 5%. This positive trend across fundamental and technical indicators leads her to believe that the market can continue its rally into November and December.\nAs the S&P 500 recently closed above 5,800 for the first time at 5,815, Bartels discussed how this milestone brings the 6,000 target closer. She echoed sentiments from Tom Lee, who suggested that market behavior could improve significantly if there is clarity regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Bartels agreed that once a winner is declared, it could trigger a relief rally as both domestic and foreign investors gain confidence in the stability of US leadership.\nTurning to the Fed\u2019s actions, Bartels addressed concerns about recent CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected. She described potential short-term volatility as a bucking bull, indicating that while fluctuations might occur, the overall trend remains upward. Her year-ahead thesis suggests both fixed-income and equity markets are poised for positive returns, albeit with some bumps along the way.\nBartels also advocated for buying opportunities in the current market environment. She specifically pointed to technology stocks and the NASDAQ, which has yet to hit a new record high. She believes technology will continue to lead the market, particularly emphasizing semiconductors as key drivers of growth. For investors looking to enter the tech sector, she sees this as an opportune moment.\nHer perspective underscores a belief in the resilience of corporate profits and economic fundamentals amid changing monetary policies and external uncertainties. At the same time, it should be noted that the optimistic outlook for the S&P 500 targeting 6,000 is significant for stock splits as it reflects positive market sentiment, encouraging companies to make their shares more accessible to retail investors. When share prices rise, splits can attract more buyers by lowering the price per share. However, it\u2019s important to note that a stock split does not change anything about a business\u2019s fundamentals. A poor company will stay a poor company post-split and a good company will stay a good company.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of stocks that are likely to split. We then selected the 20 stocks that have experienced the highest gains in their share prices over the past 5 years and have a history of spitting their stock. From that, we picked the top 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Netflix Inc. (NFLX) a Top Stock to Buy Before the Next Split?\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nShare Price as of October 18: $689.66\nSurge in Share Price in 5 Years: 150.51%\nStock Split Confirmed: no\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming service provider that offers TV shows, movies, documentaries, and original content. Founded in 1997 as a DVD rental service, it transitioned to a streaming platform in 2007. It has revolutionized the way people consume entertainment and is considered a pioneer in the streaming industry.\nThe company has introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier powered by AI in late 2022 to enhance user experience and deliver more effective ads. As a pioneer in online streaming, it\u2019s a top-performing stock. Its massive and growing subscriber base drives significant revenue growth. In 2023, it achieved record UK revenues, primarily due to increased subscriber numbers following its crackdown on password sharing.\nRevenue was up by 15.02% year-over-year in Q3 2024. Despite challenges in membership growth and ad monetization, it added over 5 million new subscribers and improved its operating margin to 29.6%. International markets drove subscriber growth, and the ad-supported tier saw a 35% quarter-on-quarter increase in memberships. The company\u2019s strategic shift towards advertising has solidified its position as a strong investment.\nManagement announced that the company\u2019s first-party ad server is launching in Canada this quarter and will expand to other markets in 2025. Partnerships with Trade Desk and Google Live are progressing well. There are plans for more ad formats, features, and measurement tools.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) projects a 14.7% increase in revenue year-over-year for Q4, with a target operating margin of 21.6%. Looking ahead to 2025, it anticipates annual revenue between $43 billion and $44 billion, driven by continued subscriber growth and higher average revenue per subscriber. The international expansion and ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences position it for continued growth.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFinally, we trimmed\u00a0Netflix, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:NFLX) mostly due to valuation but also as a source of funds to add to the new position in Shopify. As a reminder, we added to our position in August 2022 amid broad concerns about the company\u2019s ability to grow and monetize shared passwords. We expected Netflix to show progress in monetizing shared passwords, leading to robust free cash flow generation. This is now playing out and is appreciated by the market. Hence, given the balance of growth and valuation, we felt it was appropriate to reduce our exposure to a more normal weight.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 2nd on our list of stocks to buy before they split next. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NFLX, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The firm's revenue estimates are 6% and 8% ahead of the consensus for those years, respectively.\nThe anticipated integration with Netflix and Roku is expected to contribute approximately 400 basis points to The Trade Desk's gross spend growth in 2025, positioning the company's revenues ahead of consensus.\nThe firm also notes that The Trade Desk is likely to continue gaining market share from Google's DV360 in the medium term due to Alphabet's legal challenges.\n\u201cIn our view, the biggest benefit from ad-tech legal challenges at Alphabet/Google is likely to be underinvestment&lack of focus, rather than pot'l business model or industry structure changes,\u201d analysts continued.\nSeparately, Citi analysts said they expect \u201canother strong beat and raise quarter\u201d from TTD, noting that key growth drivers including CTV, Retail Media, and market share gains remain intact.

          "whole_article": "Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley remains cautious on Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), lowering its price target on the stock to $60 from $65 and maintaining an Underweight rating, as analysts believe recent investor optimism is premature.\nShares of Roku have surged about 35% since the company's Q2 2024 earnings report, driven by expectations of a stronger ad market and accelerating growth.\nHowever, Morgan Stanley warns that rising competition and structural risks pose challenges ahead.\nThe investment bank sees the recent outperformance as reflecting renewed confidence in revenue growth acceleration and operating leverage in 2H24 and 2025.\n\"We see that optimism as premature and see strong and rising competition as an underappreciated risk,\" the analysts added.\nRoku's platform segment, which generates revenue from advertising and distribution fees, faces increasing headwinds, according to Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts highlighted that competition in the connected TV (CTV) ad market from major players such as Prime Video, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Disney is intensifying.\n\"Prime Video and Netflix are likely to be more competitive in '25 than '24,\" they cautioned, which could pressure pricing and limit Roku's growth.\nRoku's third-party demand-side platform (DSP) integrations offer long-term potential, but Morgan Stanley believes the impact will remain muted due to similar strategies adopted by competitors.\nAdditionally, the firm warns of risks to Roku's subscription distribution revenue.\n\"Streamers [are] increasingly looking to avoid app store fees,\" they noted, referencing Disney's recent decision to discontinue sign-ups for Disney+ and Hulu via Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s platform.\n\"The recent outperformance in shares suggests success is starting to be priced in and we see rising risk Roku does not deliver on elevated growth expectations,\" the analysts concluded, cautioning that rising expectations could leave Roku vulnerable if the company underdelivers.\nRelated Articles\nRoku stock optimism 'premature' says Morgan Stanley, sees downside risks\nAmerican Tower misses quarterly revenue estimates on leasing slowdown\nS&P 500 counts on final 'Mag 7' push for best year this century: McGeever\nView Comments"

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Netflix\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Netflix\nWhat's The Opportunity In Netflix?\nAccording to our valuation model, Netflix seems to be fairly priced at around 4.1% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Netflix today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $781.04, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Netflix\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nWhat does the future of Netflix look like?\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Netflix. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NFLX\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NFLX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of BofA\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stocks with The Fastest Projected EPS Growth Rates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best BofA's top growth stocks with the fastest projected EPS growth rates.\nFor the stock market, if there\u2019s one thing that can be said with some certainty, it\u2019s that earnings and revenue growth drives share price performance. This is because a firm\u2019s stock price is a reflection of investor estimates of its future market potential. Firms that are believed to gain market share in the future often see their share price surge in the present as investors tailor their portfolios to try to get an early position in some of the biggest names of tomorrow.\nIn fact, we don\u2019t have to dig too deep to see this principle in action. The clearest example of it is in the stock of the AI chips company that\u2019s Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI stock so far. Its stock is up 199% year to date, 235% over the past twelve months, and 887% since the start of 2023. While all these returns are something that most\u2013if not all\u2013company executives would give an arm and a leg for, to see our principle in action, we\u2019ll have to dig deeper into the 887% share price gain.\nNarrowing down our analysis to this stock\u2019s performance in 2023\u2013from the start and to the end of the year\u2013its shares gained 239%. During the first half, they gained 189.5% and during Q1, the stock was up 90%. So, the shares\u2019 performance in Q2 has proven crucial as the starting point of a rally that has so far yielded an 887% share price appreciation. During Q2, the stock was up 52%, driven by the fact that on May 24th, 2023 (during the Q1FY24 earnings), the firm\u2019s CEO stunned investors when he shared that \u201cA trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.\u201d\nThis meant that CEO Jensen Huang believed that in the future, businesses would spend as much as $1 trillion on his company\u2019s products. Investors were ecstatic and they piled into the company to send its shares soaring by 24.6% between May 19th and May 26th. In this company\u2019s case, the CEO\u2019s optimism was also met by cold, hard results. During the same Q1, the firm\u2019s data center business division revenue jumped by 14% annually, in a sign that foretold the growth story of the next quarters. Mind you, this fiscal Q1 was only the second quarter following OpenAI\u2019s public ChatGPT release, so the AI wave that solidified in Q4 2024 was in its infancy.\nStory Continues\nThese hard results saw the firm annually grow its revenue by 101%, 206%, 265%, 262%, and 122% in its Q2FY24, Q3FY24, Q4FY24, Q1FY25, and Q2FY25, respectively. The top line growth has been accompanied by bottom line profits also jumping by triple digit percentages in all of the quarters. The highest reading was for Q2FY24 when its non-GAAP net income jumped by 843% year-over-year.\nThus, it\u2019s safe to say that growth is rewarded by the stock market. Yet, the high investor expectations for growth stocks also mean that they are punished harder in case they fail to meet expectations. Research from the University of Michigan analyzed data for 13 years covering consensus earnings forecasts, quarterly earnings, stock prices, market to book ratio, and price to earnings ratio to check whether growth and value stocks perform similarly if they fail to meet earnings expectations.\nTheir results\u00a0show\u00a0that growth stocks tend to fall more than value stocks when it comes to negative earnings surprises. The researchers add that the underperformance is typically before the earnings are announced since growth stocks typically preannounce their negative earnings surprise. A descriptive analysis of their data also shows that cumulative stock returns for the days between two earnings cycles are higher for low growth stocks over high growth stocks. For the lowest growth stocks, the cumulative returns for all firms analyzed were 0.66%, while those for firms with negative and positive earnings surprises were -3.57% and 5.44%, respectively. For the high growth stocks, cumulative returns for all firms were -0.58%, and the returns for those with negative and positive earnings surprises were -7.32% and 6.32%, respectively.\nThe research concisely sums up the potential of investing in growth stocks and the accompanying risks. Returning to our GPU designer, while right now it\u2019s at the center of the AI buzz, back in 2017 and 2018, it was at the center of the Bitcoin rush since gaming GPUs could also be used to mine cryptocurrencies. However, between mid-December 2017 and mid-December 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped by 83%. For the firm\u2019s quarter that ended in January 2019, this led to its gaming GPU revenue dropping by 45% year-over-year and 46% sequentially. This was because the crypto sector had over ordered GPUs, but as Bitcoin prices fell, mining became unprofitable and the over-ordering led to a glut in the market. Looking at the firm\u2019s post split stock price, this led to the stock falling by 53% between October and the end of December 2018.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of BofA\u2019s top growth stock picks, we used the bank\u2019s latest list of stocks that are rated Buy, have an EPS surprise rating, and the highest projected growth rates for the next five years. The stocks were ranked by their projected EPS growth rates.\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

With 282.7 million subscribers under its belt as of September 2024. Its reliance on subscribers means that it has to focus on customer retention and user monetization to drive its share price higher. Consequently, it was unsurprising that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s stock rose 4.45% after the firm\u2019s third quarter of 2024 earnings saw it add 5.1 million subscribers and beat analyst estimates by more than a million. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also delivered on the revenue and earnings front, with its $9.93 billion revenue and $5.40 in EPS beating analyst estimates of $9.77 billion and $5.12. However, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s Q3 subscriber additions were lower than the year ago quarter\u2019s 8.76 million, and with management now set to discontinue sharing subscriber count, investor sentiment will depend on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s revenue and cost control.\nEnsemble Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cThe rapid recovery of Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth has shocked investors who drove the stock down to a price of just $166 in May 2022. While at the time, bearish investors were declaring the company\u2019s growth days were behind it, instead the company added a remarkable 13.1 million new subscribers in the most recent quarter. This was the single largest quarterly subscriber addition other than the large gains experienced during the first quarter of COVID. For all of 2023, the company added nearly 30 million new subscribers, making it the largest annual gain in Netflix history other than the first year of COVID.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 6th on our list of best BofA's top growth stocks with the fastest projected EPS growth rates. NFLX is one of the top stocks with the highest consensus earnings growth according to BofA. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nNetflix (NFLX) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this internet video service a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Netflix is 25.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 64.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 17.5%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Netflix is 5.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.9%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 17.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 1.7%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Netflix have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.6% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNetflix has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Netflix is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to figures from Ofcom, 68pc of UK households reported using a streaming service in the first three months of 2024, up from 66pc in 2023.\nThe most popular services were Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, with Netflix remaining the most watched, averaging 21 minutes per person per day in 2023.\nHere, Telegraph Money takes a look at what each of the major TV streaming platforms offer, along with tips on how you can cut costs without sacrificing the films and TV shows you want to watch.\nNetflix\nNetflix, which began as a DVD postal service, launched its groundbreaking streaming service in 2007 and by 2010 it was available on most devices.\nIt now creates enormous amounts of original content, such as the shows Bridgerton, The Crown and Baby Reindeer, and films including Scoop and Academy Award winner All Quiet On The Western Front.\nPreviously the streaming service had a large library of older content, although this has been eroded by other content producers launching their own platforms.\nSubscription numbers dropped after its 2022 announcement that it would be cracking down on password sharing, but the platform also added a cheaper membership option \u2013 which comes with ad breaks. Its viewing figures have since recovered, and its latest count of paying viewers topped 282.7 million globally.\nUK customers now have to pay an extra \u00a34.99 per month on top of their existing subscription to share their account outside their home.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a34.99 for a standard account with adverts for two devices; \u00a310.99 for standard account for two devices (extra member slots outside your household can be added for \u00a34.99); \u00a315.99 for premium account for four devices (extra member slots can be added for \u00a34.99). All charges are monthly.\nCan you share your password? Not any more. Netflix wrote to users in May 2023 to inform them they could no longer share accounts with people outside of their household. However, those signed up for a standard or premium account can purchase extra member slots for people who don\u2019t live with them for \u00a34.99 a month.\nStory continues\nAmazon Prime\nThe Amazon Prime Video platform is just one part of the Prime subscription, which also offers services like Prime Reading and free delivery on qualifying Amazon orders. Like Netflix, it has a number of original films and TV shows, with big hitters including Clarkson\u2019s Farm, The Grand Tour and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\nAmazon also has the rights to show 20 matches of Premier League fixtures over the course of a season. Both rounds for this season have already been shown, and it will not have the rights from the 2025-26 season onwards.\nThe streaming service recently launched ads, meaning your content will be interrupted by regular adverts unless you pay an extra \u00a32.99 each month.\nCustomers can get a one-month free trial before the paid subscription kicks in, while students can get a free six-month trial.\nIf you don\u2019t want free delivery or any of the other Prime services, you can get a cheaper Prime Video subscription, which is just for the streaming service.\nNote that you can end up paying extra to rent or buy titles that aren\u2019t part of the free Prime viewing offer. Look out for the Amazon Prime banner, which indicates the free things you can watch, or check out the \u201cFree to me\u201d section. Some shows, such as Neighbours, are free with adverts on Amazon\u2019s Freevee service.\nIt is possible to link Amazon accounts with another adult in your household and up to two children in order to share Prime benefits, including Prime Video, meaning only one subscription per household is needed.\nAmazon has not announced a password crackdown, so even if you don\u2019t link accounts, you should be able to share the Prime Video benefits with friends and family.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a35.99 per month for Prime Video only; \u00a38.99 per month or \u00a395 per year (\u00a312.88 cheaper); for students it\u2019s \u00a34.49 per month or \u00a347.49 per year (\u00a36.39 cheaper). It costs \u00a32.99 extra each month to watch ad-free.\nCan you share your password? You can share your Prime membership with someone else in your household, meaning you can both also get perks like free deliveries. There\u2019s no mechanism in place to strictly prohibit password sharing with other people, but be aware they may be able to access the rest of your Amazon account.\nDisney+\nWith more than 153 million subscribers as of August 2024, Disney+ has caused a real stir in the streaming market since it launched in the UK in March 2020.\nOriginally designed to be the home of all much-loved children\u2019s Disney content, the platform has expanded with its Star Wars and Marvel content. It also hosts a number of series popular with adults, such as Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Modern Family and exclusive content such as Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals.\nIts popularity with older generations has increased, with subscribers aged over-64 rising from 7pc in 2022 to 12pc in 2023, according to Ofcom.\nUsers can access Disney\u2019s entire back catalogue from its 80-year history, and the service also has exclusive streaming of new Disney films \u2013 though if you want these new films early it can cost around \u00a319.99 extra, on top of your subscription.\nIn November 2023 Disney announced an ad-supported subscription plan for \u00a34.99.\nIt has also cracked down on password sharing, with the possibility of being blocked from the streaming service if it detects that the account is shared with people who don\u2019t live at the primary residence.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a34.99 per month for a standard account with adverts for two devices; \u00a38.99 a month or \u00a389.90 a year (\u00a317.98 cheaper) for a standard account for two devices; \u00a312.99 per month or \u00a3129.90 per year (\u00a325.98 cheaper) for a premium account for four devices. Since it cracked down on password sharing, you can add an extra member, not in your household, for \u00a33.99 per month with ads, or \u00a34.99 per month without ads.\nCan you share your password? As of September 2024 you can no longer share a Disney+ account with someone outside of your household. Its customer support defines a household as \u201cthe collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside therein.\u201d\nIf you want to share your account outside of your household, you have to pay \u00a33.99 per month to add an extra member, or \u00a34.99 per month for ad-free viewing.\nNOW TV\nLaunched in 2012, NOW is Sky\u2019s on-demand streaming service, and is the place to go for many blockbusters and fan-favourite shows such as Game Of Thrones and Succession.\nArguably the most customisable service out there, you can get \u201cpasses\u201d for the specific kinds of things you want to watch \u2013 the Entertainment Pass covers Sky TV series and box sets, as well as children\u2019s shows, and a Sport Pass lets you watch everything on Sky Sports, while a Hayu Pass allows you watch reality TV shows such as Real Housewives and Below Deck at the same time it\u2019s released in America, putting an end to spoilers.\nIn addition, you can choose how long you want to sign up for. Most passes come with a rolling monthly option, but the Sports Pass, for example, has a day pass option where you spend \u00a314.99 for 24-hour access to 12 live Sky Sports channels \u2013 ideal if there\u2019s just one particular match you want to watch.\nHowever, it can get expensive if you want access to all of the channels.\nWith the standard subscription for an Entertainment or Cinema Pass you can only stream on one device at a time, and will have to watch ads. You can add on a Boost subscription for \u00a36 per month to watch on two devices and watch ad-free, or Ultra Boost for \u00a39 which allows three devices and ad-free viewing.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a39.99 a month for Entertainment Pass or Cinema Pass; \u00a334.99 a month for Sport Pass; \u00a34.99 a month for Hayu Pass (for reality TV).\nCan you share your password? There\u2019s nothing strictly prohibiting password sharing, but you may come a cropper as only a limited number of streams can take place at the same time. To get three simultaneous streams, you need to sign up to the Boost service, which costs an extra \u00a39 a month after a seven-day free period.\nApple TV+\nWhile Apple TV+ was once one of the best value streaming services on the market, its \u00a36.99 monthly price has since risen to \u00a38.99, putting it broadly in-line with several other services.\nThe streaming service, which is free for three months to those who buy new Apple products, has however received criticism for its relatively small library, but the shows are Apple TV+ originals.\nAmong its big hitters are football-comedy-with-feelings Ted Lasso, and The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Anniston and Reese Witherspoon. Watching anything on Apple TV+ is ad-free.\nIn an Oscars upset, the streaming service became the first to win a Best Picture award for CODA, a heart-warming indie drama, beating offerings from the likes of Netflix.\nUp to five family members can be added to the subscription and the main account holder can stop others from making extra purchases via your Apple account \u2013 perfect for stopping small children overspending on your card.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a38.99 a month after a seven-day free trial.\nCan you share your password? You\u2019re encouraged to share your Apple TV+ account with up to five family members in your household. It\u2019s possible to share with people outside of your household, but you\u2019ll want to be extra careful about making sure the extra purchase option is turned off.\nParamount+\nLaunched in the UK in 2022, Paramount+ is vying to compete with the streaming mainstays of Amazon and Netflix.\nIt has a large catalogue of content \u2013 ranging from original shows, to programmes from channels like MTV and Comedy Central. It has also branched into Star Trek spin-off shows, and rebooted the US comedy Frasier.\nParamount\u2019s collection of films is also quite substantial, including 90s classics Titanic and Clueless, as well as more recent releases such as the Mean Girls musical.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a36.99 a month, or \u00a369.90 a year. It comes with a seven-day free trial. Sky Cinema subscribers can use the streaming service for free.\nCan you share your password?\u00a0Six profiles can be created with your account, so theoretically, you can share your account with five other people. Only two devices can be in use at once, so two people can watch Paramount+ at the same time from the same account.\nFree options and other ways to save\nIf you want to maintain access to the various streaming services, there are a few ways you can cut your costs.\nConsider rotating your subscriptions\nIf you\u2019re paying monthly, it can make sense to pause or cancel your account whenever you\u2019re not using it. For example, if you\u2019re signed up to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, you could pause two accounts while you focus on watching things on Netflix, the next month pause Netflix and focus on Disney+, and so on.\nShare whenever you can\nEven if you can\u2019t share your passwords \u2013 or don\u2019t want to \u2013 at least make sure there aren\u2019t multiple accounts being paid for within your household. Each service usually comes with more than enough available profiles for everyone to maintain their own list of things they\u2019re watching, and recommendations for further viewing. It\u2019s also possible to add parental controls to children\u2019s profiles, ensuring they can only view age-appropriate content.\nUse free trials\nMost streaming services offer free trials, of varying lengths. Getting three months of free Apple TV+, for example, is more than enough time to get through a couple of its best series \u2013 after which time you can simply cancel your subscription.\nCheck for bundles\nIn some cases, you can get a streaming service thrown in with certain mobile phone bundles \u2013 so make sure you\u2019re not paying for something you could be getting for free.\nFor example, Vodafone phone and SIM only customers can get its entertainment plan, which includes membership to YouTube Premium or Amazon Prime. Some Sky packages also come with Netflix thrown in; currently, you can get Sky Stream with Netflix (standard with ads) for \u00a328 per month for 24 months.\nOpt for free streaming\nWhile you will need a TV licence to watch BBC iPlayer and any live shows on other catch-up services, viewers can stream ITV X, My 5, and Channel 4 for free.\nAlternatively, Internet Archive, a free digital library, offers a large collection of films that are in the public domain \u2013 but don\u2019t expect to find the latest blockbusters. Top Documentary Films is a site perfect for when you want to learn something, offering thousands of insightful documentaries."

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI is working with Broadcom Inc. to develop a new artificial intelligence chip specifically focused on running AI models after they\u2019ve been trained, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThere Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC\u2019s Historic Meatpacking District\nNY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link\nInside NYC\u2019s Playbook for Getting Federal Grant Funds\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nThe AI startup and chipmaker are also consulting with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world\u2019s largest chip contract manufacturer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. OpenAI has been planning a custom chip and working on such uses for the technology for around a year, the people said, but the discussions are still at an early stage.\nOpenAI declined to comment. A representative for Broadcom didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and a TSMC spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on rumors and speculation. Reuters reported on OpenAI\u2019s ongoing talks with Broadcom and TSMC on Tuesday. The Information reported in June that Broadcom had discussed making an AI chip for OpenAI.\nThe process for taking a chip from design to production is long and expensive. OpenAI is less focused on graphics processing units, chips that are used to train and build generative AI models \u2014 a market that has been cornered by Nvidia Corp. Instead, it\u2019s looking for a specialized chip that will run the software and respond to user requests, a process called inference. Investors and analysts expect the need for chips to support inference will only grow as more tech companies use AI models to field more complex tasks.\nOpenAI may continue to research setting up its own network of foundries, or chip factories, one of the people said, but the startup has realized that working with partners on custom chips is a quicker, attainable path for now. Reuters earlier reported that OpenAI was pulling back from the effort of establishing its own chip manufacturing capacity.\nBroadcom shares closed up 4.2% to $179.24 in New York trading on Tuesday. Even before the latest gain, they were up 54% this year. TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares closed more than 1% higher.\nBroadcom is the largest designer of application-specific integrated circuits \u2014 chips designed to fit a single purpose specified by the customer. The company\u2019s biggest customer in this area is Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Broadcom also works with Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\nStory Continues\nWhen asked last month whether he has new customers for the business, given the huge demand for AI training, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that he will only add to his short list of customers when projects hit volume shipments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy product to deploy for any customer, and so we do not consider proof of concepts as production volume,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call.\nOpenAI\u2019s services require massive amounts of computing power to develop and run \u2014 with much of that coming from Nvidia chips. To meet the demand, the industry has been scrambling to find alternatives to Nvidia. That\u2019s included embracing processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and developing in-house versions.\nOpenAI is also actively planning investments and partnerships in data centers, the eventual home for such AI chips. The startup\u2019s leadership has pitched the US government on the need for more massive data centers and CEO Sam Altman has sounded out global investors, including some in the Middle East, to finance the effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stretch,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told Bloomberg Television on Monday. \u201cStretch from a capital perspective but also my own learning.

Analysts estimated $7.55 billion on average.\nThough the company now expects to get more than $5 billion in sales from so-called AI accelerators this year \u2014 up from a previous forecast of $4.5 billion \u2014 some analysts and investors had been looking for a bigger bump.\nAMD is playing catch-up with Nvidia Corp. in the lucrative market for these chips, which help develop and run AI services. The company is now generating billions of dollars from that type of product \u2014 a rapid rise from a year ago \u2014 but the level remains well short of the tens of billions of dollars that its rival is raking in.\nOn a conference call following the results, Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su pushed back on concerns that AMD isn\u2019t delivering enough growth. The company is ramping up production and earning the trust of the large data center companies that rely on AI accelerators, she said.\n\u201cWhat I will say is customers are very, very open to AMD,\u201d Su said. \u201cAnd we see that everywhere we go. Everyone is giving us a very fair shot at earning their business, and that\u2019s what we intend to do.\u201d\nAMD shares fell more than 7% in late trading Tuesday. They were up 13% this year, closing at $166.25 in New York.\nAMD\u2019s third-quarter revenue rose 18% to $6.82 billion, beating an average estimate of $6.71 billion. Profit, minus certain items, increased to 92 cents a share, in line with projections.\nAMD\u2019s new MI300 accelerator products, which compete with Nvidia chips, have emerged as one of its biggest sales engines. But the growth has been hampered by the availability of supply. Like most companies in the industry, AMD no longer owns its own plants, opting instead to outsource production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\nThe company has made progress in getting more supply from its vendors, but still expects to have little latitude in terms of meeting demand if it\u2019s above current projections, Su said on the call.\n\u201cI think we expect that the environment will continue to be tight, but we\u2019ve also planned for significant growth going into 2025,\u201d Su said. \u201cWe feel good about our overall supply-chain capability.\u201d\nStory Continues\nInvestors track AMD\u2019s performance as an indicator of overall demand for AI-related hardware. Massive spending by companies such as Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS and Microsoft Corp. on this still-new type of computing infrastructure has upended the industry. The concern among investors is that AI services aren\u2019t yet big moneymakers, which may make it harder for companies to continue justifying the expense of buying the chips.\nIn addition to being Nvidia\u2019s biggest rival in AI accelerators, AMD also competes with that company in graphics chips used by computer gamers. And it goes head-to-head with Intel Corp. in personal computer and server processors.\nAMD\u2019s data-center unit had sales of $3.5 billion last quarter, more than double the total from a year earlier and slightly above estimates. PC chips brought in $1.88 billion, up 29%.\nAMD also supplies custom processors for Microsoft and Sony Group Corp. for their game consoles. That unit has seen weaker sales, hurt by the current generation of game machines nearing the end of their life cycles. Revenue fell 69% to $462 million, missing estimates.\nAMD also predicted a fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin \u2014 the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production \u2014 that was just shy of projections.\n(Updates with conference call remarks starting in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "By Max A. Cherney, Jeffrey Dastin, Dawn Chmielewski, Fanny Potkin and Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon. He soon made a big mistake.\nIntel had a sweet deal going with Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, the giant manufacturer of semiconductors for other companies. TSMC would make chips that Intel designed but could not produce. And it was offering deep discounts to Intel, say four people with knowledge of the agreement.\nInstead of nurturing the relationship, Gelsinger \u2013 who hopes to restore Intel\u2019s own manufacturing prowess \u2013 offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan\u2019s precarious relations with China. \u201cYou don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab,\u201d he said in May 2021, using industry jargon for a chip fabrication plant. That December, encouraging U.S. investment in U.S. chipmakers, he said at a tech conference: \u201cTaiwan is not a stable place.\u201d\nIn public, TSMC downplayed the comments, with its founder calling Gelsinger \u201ca bit rude.\u201d Privately, TSMC said it would no longer honor the discount, the sources said: about 40% off the $23,000, 3-nanometer wafers on which TSMC would print chips for Intel. Intel had to pay full price, shrinking its profit margin on the deal.\nAsked about the previously unreported episode, Intel said TSMC is an important partner with which it has a \u201chealthy business relationship today.\u201d TSMC told Reuters Intel is an important customer.\nGelsinger\u2019s affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps during his time as Intel CEO. He inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. But Gelsinger compounded those problems.\nThis account of his rocky tenure is based on interviews with about four dozen current and former Intel employees and executives, as well as internal company videos, supplier documents and regulatory records.\nGelsinger set sky-high expectations for Intel\u2019s manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or canceling contracts or unable to deliver the promised products. He issued optimistic public projections for AI-chip deals that were far higher than Intel\u2019s own internal sales forecasts, company insiders say.\nAnd like TSMC, Gelsinger sought to transform Intel into a \"foundry,\" an operation that makes chips designed by other companies. But Intel\u2019s efforts to regain manufacturing leadership with a chip-production process called 18A have faced delays and technical problems, with some customers so far declining to use it.\nStory continues\nIntel declined to make Gelsinger available for an interview.\n\u201cPat is leading one of the largest, boldest and most consequential corporate turnarounds in American business history,\u201d Intel said in a statement. \u201c3.5 years into the journey, we have made immense progress \u2013 and we\u2019re going to finish the job.\u201d\nIntel\u2019s revenue shriveled to $54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from the year Gelsinger took over. Analysts expect Intel to lose $3.68 billion this year, its first annual net loss since 1986. Its shares closed at $22.92 on Monday, off 66% from a peak hit in Gelsinger\u2019s first months as CEO.\nThe crash in Intel\u2019s share price has sparked takeover interest, Reuters has reported. Intel has vowed to restructure and to cut more than 15,000 jobs.\nIntel said it won\u2019t let merger speculation distract it from executing its five-year turnaround plan. Under Gelsinger, Intel said, it has revamped its operations, secured up to $45 billion in U.S. support, led the market for AI PC chips, and \u201cachieved a historic pace\u201d of innovation.\nIntel told Reuters its 18A fabrication technologies are yielding good-quality chips and that it \u201cexpects to return to process leadership in 2025\u201d with their formal launch. The company said it objects to the \u201cusage of rumors, leaked materials, half-truths and interviews based on the widest net that can be cast for \u2018sources\u2019 to gain negative commentary on Intel.\u201d\nCustomers have little incentive to bet on Intel\u2019s manufacturing when TSMC continues to serve them well, said Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. \u201cIf you care about performance today, tomorrow, next year, over the next couple of years, you are not making that bet,\u201d Hari said.\nStill, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in September U.S. manufacturing represents a supply-chain \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that major chip designers would pay for. \u201cThey should want U.S.-made leading-edge chips,\u201d she said.\nIntel\u2019s stumbles have implications for U.S. industrial policy. Gelsinger\u2019s vow to create a foundry raised hopes in the Biden Administration that Intel would help bring chip production back under U.S. control on U.S. soil.\nA White House spokesperson said that a bill championed by President Joe Biden, the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to invest in not one but dozens of companies strengthening the semiconductor supply chain. Intel has won more than $11 billion in proposed funding under the act.\nGelsinger\u2019s journey at Intel started in 1979 when he was 18. He stayed for 30 years, coming under the tutelage of Andy Grove, Intel\u2019s legendarily demanding former CEO, which Gelsinger likened to \u201cgoing to the dentist and not getting Novocaine.\u201d Gelsinger became Intel\u2019s first chief technology officer but left in 2009 around a restructuring.\nIntel changed while he was away. Its so-called \u201cGrovian\u201d culture of constructive confrontation \u2013 one that encouraged peers to challenge each other with data \u2013 faded away. Intel also missed huge market opportunities. It stuck to its strengths, chips for desktop computers and servers. But it passed on a chance to produce semiconductors for the iPhone and declined to fund breakthrough artificial-intelligence company OpenAI.\nHis return in February 2021 gave a boost to Intel. Investors cheered his appointment, sending shares up nearly 7% on the day of the January announcement. Employees said they celebrated having a technologist back in charge.\nIntel, in Gelsinger\u2019s view, needed to execute at a \u201ctorrid\u201d pace. He at times wore a black T-shirt, available to buy at Intel\u2019s company store, with the word \u201ctorrid\u201d emblazoned on it. The energetic CEO did push-ups and jumping jacks before speaking at Intel events, a witness said.\nThe bet on which Gelsinger staked Intel\u2019s future came less than two months into his tenure: a global foundry that could vie with TSMC. In March 2021, he promised to invest $20 billion in two Arizona factories. That July, he said Intel also would develop five manufacturing processes in four years. Among them was 18A, a bundle of technologies under development that he hoped would restore Intel\u2019s manufacturing excellence.\nGelsinger pushed for Congress to subsidize American chip manufacturing. In January 2022, he stood with Biden to announce another $20 billion for two factories in Ohio. Gelsinger told Reuters at the time that Intel\u2019s commitment in the state might reach $100 billion to create \u201cthe largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet.\u201d\n\u2018FIVE REASONS TO BELIEVE\u2019\nChip sales boomed in the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumers gobbled up tech gadgets. By the spring of 2022, with product prices spiking and workers returning to offices, a glut emerged. Intel\u2019s revenue from personal computer chips dropped 25% in the second quarter of 2022. And it lost market share for chip sales in data centers to Advanced Micro Devices, while companies such as Amazon.com and Google increasingly designed silicon in-house.\nGelsinger called on staff to keep the faith. In regular video dispatches, he set out \u201cfive reasons to believe\u201d in Intel, say four people who saw them. In an early video, seen by Reuters, he urged employees to \u201cbelieve deeply in your heart and soul Intel\u2019s best days are ahead.\u201d\nIntel said Gelsinger \u201cconsistently balanced his optimism with a clear-eyed view of the challenges inherent in getting there.\u201d\nGelsinger was optimistic with clients, too. He oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet\u2019s growing fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis, set to roll out across the U.S., three people familiar with the previously unreported plans told Reuters. Gelsinger personally discussed the deal with Sundar Pichai, Alphabet\u2019s CEO, two of the people said.\nBut after Intel\u2019s outlook worsened in 2022, the company canceled the Waymo deal, the two people said, and paid a fee to Alphabet after Alphabet threatened legal action.\nSandra Rivera, who formerly ran Intel\u2019s data center group and is now CEO of Intel-owned Altera, said in an interview that her team cut the Waymo project after a corporate reorganization required her to make \u201cdecisions about the entire portfolio.\u201d\nIntel said it has a strong partnership with Alphabet and declined to discuss the project. Alphabet declined to comment on the matter.\nGelsinger announced cost cuts in October 2022 to bolster Intel while he continued to pour money into factories. The company said it would save $3 billion starting the following year from steps such as business exits and layoffs.\nUnder his watch, Intel\u2019s headcount had risen to some 132,000 employees by the end of 2022 from about 111,000 when he joined. In its statement, Intel said the \u201cunprecedented pace\u201d at which it developed technology and capacity necessitated such hiring.\nCHATGPT MOMENT\nNvidia\u2019s graphics processing units, or GPUs, posed a new challenge in November 2022. That month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that could conjure human-like prose on command. It became history\u2019s fastest growing software application at the time. Nvidia\u2019s chips power the data centers behind ChatGPT.\nOriginally designed for videogames, researchers discovered years ago that GPUs are useful for AI applications. They could handle vast numbers of simultaneous calculations better than central processing units, or CPUs, from Intel.\nNvidia saw its stock triple in eight months, notching a $1 trillion valuation. Intel\u2019s stock saw choppy trading; it cut base pay for mid-level workers and restricted promotions and bonuses.\nGelsinger too would take a salary cut, Intel said. Still, his total compensation, including stock awards, rose to $16.9 million in 2023 from $11.6 million the year before, a proxy filing shows.\nAround this time, Gelsinger had high hopes for Intel\u2019s Gaudi chip, a so-called AI accelerator \u2013 a processor that improves the performance of artificial intelligence applications. Intel touted the chip \u2013 designed in-house and made by TSMC \u2013 as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s often scarce GPUs.\nTeams at Intel estimated it could sell at most $500 million in AI chips, three people familiar with the forecast said. In a meeting with executives in the second quarter of 2023, Gelsinger said this number was not high enough. Intel needed to tell Wall Street it could hit at least $1 billion at a time when Nvidia\u2019s comparable sales were far higher, one of the people cited Gelsinger as saying.\nGelsinger touted the $1 billion figure in public. On Intel\u2019s July 2023 earnings-results call, he told analysts of \u201csurging demand for AI products.\u201d He added: \u201cOur pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share.\u201d\nAccording to one of these sources and another person briefed on the matter, Intel at the time of Gelsinger's announcement had not secured anything near the supply needed from TSMC to sell $1 billion in AI-accelerator chips. After Gelsinger demanded the billion-dollar target, Intel tweaked its math to justify it, lumping in chips unrelated to its marquee AI offering, two sources said.\nIntel said Gelsinger\u2019s comments accurately reflected prospective deals, not sales. \u201cNo company converts 100% of its pipeline into revenue,\u201d Intel said. \u201cWe make no apologies for setting ambitious internal targets for our teams \u2013 and we will always try to exceed the goals we set for ourselves.\u201d\nAs recently as January of this year, Intel told investors it had more than $2 billion in possible AI chip deals in the pipeline. In April, Gelsinger revealed to analysts a much lower AI revenue goal for this year: more than $500 million.\nAt times, Gelsinger has told leaders at major clients that Intel could furnish alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, said three people familiar with the talks \u2013 including for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, two of them said. When customers sought details, Intel managers had little to show and some deals didn\u2019t happen, the sources said.\nMicrosoft declined to comment. Amazon referred Reuters to recent news about its work with Intel.\nIntel has struggled to pick an AI-chip strategy. It funded three projects simultaneously by 2019: a GPU of its own, and two other chips designed to perform AI calculations from a pair of companies it acquired. None of the three made significant inroads against Nvidia or AMD, Reuters has reported.\nOn Intel\u2019s GPU efforts, Rivera, the former data center chief, told Reuters: \u201cIt\u2019s a journey, and everything looks simpler from the outside.\u201d\nIntel said the strategy anticipates how businesses will want to run AI more cheaply and how it alone can serve AI chip-design and manufacturing needs.\nMANUFACTURING WOES\nGelsinger kept pushing ahead despite setbacks, with Intel trumpeting factory expansions that would cost more than $60 billion. Then, this summer, he hit the brakes on some of these construction plans.\nIntel\u2019s ambitious new process for making chips for other firms \u2013 18A \u2013 also remains a question mark.\nSome customers have been disappointed by what they\u2019ve seen of 18A.\nWhen one big prospect, chip and software company Broadcom, sent foot-wide wafers through Intel\u2019s 18A process, the process was not ready for high-volume production for external customers, Reuters reported in September. No more than 20% of the chips printed via 18A passed Broadcom's early tests, two people briefed on the results said. That is low compared to TSMC\u2019s early-stage yields.\nBroadcom told Reuters it has \u201cnot concluded\u201d its evaluation of whether to use Intel\u2019s foundry.\nOn the day of the Reuters report in September, Intel issued a statement saying it was on track to launch 18A in 2025 and had released tools for partners and customers to plan chips for the process.\nA recent planning document produced by an Intel supplier indicates delays, however. The document, seen by Reuters, noted the supplier is still waiting to receive another digital design kit it needs to push ahead. It also lacked access to Intel factories, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Customers have little prospect of making chips in high volume with the 18A process until 2026, two people said.\nApple and Qualcomm, among other potential clients, have passed on 18A for technical reasons, three people with knowledge of their decisions said. Both companies declined to comment.\nIntel said it expects to reclaim leadership in chip-manufacturing processes in 2025 by launching 18A.\nGelsinger said in mid-September Intel had a \u201clot of work ahead,\u201d but he continues to project confidence in his turnaround plan.\n\u201cI'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,\u201d Gelsinger told Reuters in August. \u201cThree years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.\u201d\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin, Max Cherney and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, and Fanny Potkin in Singapore; additional reporting by Milana Vinn in New York and Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Claudia Parsons)"

For the full year, gross margins are expected to be in the mid-70% range.\nNvidia, Software\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\nNvidia\u2019s market cap is more or less $3.5 trillion. This means investors expect NVDA to earn around $180 billion per year once it becomes a more mature company like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) which is currently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 19. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s quarterly revenue and profits are probably around $33 billion and $18 billion respectively right now. Is it reasonable to assume that NVDA\u2019s quarterly profit can go from $18 billion today to $45 billion in a few years and then continue to grow at the same rate that GOOGL\u2019s quarterly profit is growing?\nIf NVDA manages to earn $180 billion in after-tax profits in a few years and then its profits continue to increase at around 10% annual rate, its market valuation will probably be around $3.5 trillion. That means NVDA investors will generate a total return of zero percent if NVDA satisfies the expectations embedded in its current stock price. For NVDA investors to generate a modest 10% annual return, NVDA needs to generate close to $250 billion in annual after tax profits by 2028.\nWhile we acknowledge NVDA's market dominance and potential as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "By Krystal Hu, Fanny Potkin and Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - OpenAI is working with Broadcom and TSMC to build its first in-house chip designed to support its artificial intelligence systems, while adding AMD chips alongside Nvidia chips to meet its surging infrastructure demands, sources told Reuters.\nOpenAI, the fast-growing company behind ChatGPT, has examined a range of options to diversify chip supply and reduce costs. OpenAI considered building everything in-house and raising capital for an expensive plan to build a network of factories known as \"foundries\" for chip manufacturing.\nThe company has dropped the ambitious foundry plans for now due to the costs and time needed to build a network, and plans instead to focus on in-house chip design efforts, according to sources, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss private matters.\nThe company's strategy, detailed here for the first time, highlights how the Silicon Valley startup is leveraging industry partnerships and a mix of internal and external approaches to secure chip supply and manage costs like larger rivals Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft. As one of the largest buyers of chips, OpenAI's decision to source from a diverse array of chipmakers while developing its customized chip could have broader tech sector implications.\nBroadcom stock jumped following the report, finishing Tuesday's trading up over 4.5%. AMD shares also extended their gains from the morning session, ending the day up 3.7%.\nOpenAI, AMD and TSMC declined to comment. Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOpenAI, which helped commercialize generative AI that produces human-like responses to queries, relies on substantial computing power to train and run its systems. As one of the largest purchasers of Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs), OpenAI uses AI chips both to train models where the AI learns from data and for inference, applying AI to make predictions or decisions based on new information.\nReuters previously reported on OpenAI's chip design endeavors. The Information reported on talks with Broadcom and others.\nOpenAI has been working for months with Broadcom to build its first AI chip focusing on inference, according to sources. Demand right now is greater for training chips, but analysts have predicted the need for inference chips could surpass them as more AI applications are deployed.\nBroadcom helps companies including Alphabet unit Google fine-tune chip designs for manufacturing and also supplies parts of the design that help move information on and off the chips quickly. This is important in AI systems where tens of thousands of chips are strung together to work in tandem.\nStory continues\nOpenAI is still determining whether to develop or acquire other elements for its chip design, and may engage additional partners, said two of the sources.\nThe company has assembled a chip team of about 20 people, led by top engineers who have previously built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) at Google, including Thomas Norrie and Richard Ho.\nSources said that through Broadcom, OpenAI has secured manufacturing capacity with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to make its first custom-designed chip in 2026. They said the timeline could change.\nCurrently, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs hold over 80% market share. But shortages and rising costs have led major customers like Microsoft, Meta, and now OpenAI, to explore in-house or external alternatives.\nOpenAI\u2019s planned use of AMD chips through Microsoft's Azure, first reported here, shows how AMD's new MI300X chips are trying to gain a slice of the market dominated by Nvidia. AMD has projected $4.5 billion in 2024 AI chip sales, following the chip's launch in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTraining AI models and operating services like ChatGPT are expensive. OpenAI has projected a $5 billion loss this year on $3.7 billion in revenue, according to sources. Compute costs, or expenses for hardware, electricity and cloud services needed to process large datasets and develop models, are the company's largest expense, prompting efforts to optimize utilization and diversify suppliers.\nOpenAI has been cautious about poaching talent from Nvidia because it wants to maintain a good rapport with the chip maker it remains committed to working with, especially for accessing its new generation of Blackwell chips, sources added.\nNvidia declined to comment.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York, Fanny Potkin in Singapore, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, additional reporting by Anna Tong and Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and David Gregorio)"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nTom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management Group, states that the two things to look for in the earnings season are consumer spending and companies' spending on technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Recent reports from the financial sector and retailers suggest that consumers are in good financial shape, setting the stage for a promising holiday season as well as providing a solid opportunity for growth in the fourth quarter. He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nSometimes, these AI-related names are a bit overvalued and there is volatility; but the long-term thesis remains strong. In fact, these \u201cdown days\u201d can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major \u201cAI arms race\u201d is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings.\nJust like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn\u2019t surprised by recent market developments. It\u2019s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is \u201ceasy to hope\u201d that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, \u201creaffirms that confidence\u201d.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents.\n\u201cWe think every company in the world, whether it\u2019s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.\u201d -Taylor told CNBC in an interview.\nIn other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo\u2019s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both.\n\"Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety.\" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company\u2019s Master Perfumer\nAdvancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI\u2019s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company:\n\u201cNeither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\u201d.\nWith that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (\nsee more details here\n).\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Unveils AI Workflow for Credit Card Fraud Detection, Enhancing Security for Financial Institutions\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nLeading the way in AI computing, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a darling AI stock. It is not only the leader in the AI chip market but has also built a robust AI ecosystem spanning graphics, computing, and networking solutions. Its GPUs are the backbone of AI innovation globally, powering everything from advanced data centers to autonomous systems.\nOn October 28, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed on its blog that they have developed a new NVIDIA workflow optimized for credit card transaction fraud. The new NVIDIA AI workflow for fraud detection that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses accelerated data processing and advanced algorithms to improve AI\u2019s ability to detect and prevent credit card transaction fraud. The workflow was launched at the Money20/20 fintech conference this week, enabling financial institutions to recognize subtle patterns and anomalies in transaction data based on user behavior. The workflow will help them improve accuracy and reduce false positives compared with traditional methods, keeping customers\u2019 money, identities, and digital accounts safe.\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This could be due to fewer fears around market concentration, capex spending or valuations, compared with the last two quarters.\u201d\nInvestors will be closely watching the results and outlooks from the companies, which together represent more than 20% weighting in the S&P 500 index, after the stellar earnings reported by technology firms earlier in the year. The earnings will be followed next week by the closely contested US presidential election and Federal Reserve meeting, piling up a slew of potentially market-moving events for investors to protect against.\nBreaking it down a bit further, in five of the past eight quarters Apple\u2019s options implied a larger swing than was actually realized, while Microsoft options were more expensive in six of eight. On the other hand, Meta\u2019s swings have outpaced the implied moves more than half the time, sometimes by more than 10 percentage points.\nAlthough Nvidia Corp. doesn\u2019t report this week, investors will be watching capital spending outlooks closely, as four of the companies account for a large chunk of the chipmaker\u2019s sales.

Revenue, excluding partner payouts, increased to $74.6 billion, up about 16% from the year-ago quarter and surpassing the $72.9 billion analysts predicted on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income was $2.12 per share, the company said Tuesday in a statement, compared with estimates of $1.84 per share.\nAs its main search business matures, Google is betting on growth from its cloud division, which supplies computing power, software and services to other companies. Google is drawing more cloud customers using its AI expertise to gain ground on larger rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, making inroads by signing on fast-growing AI startups \u2014 some of which were founded by former Googlers \u2014 as clients.\n\u201cIn cloud, our AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers, attract new customers and win larger deals,\u201d Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in the statement.\nAlphabet shares rose more than 5% in extended trading following the report. The stock has gained 21% this year.\nSales in the cloud division jumped to $11.4 billion, a 35% rise from the year-ago period and better than analysts had projected. Google is third in the market, but there is room for it to grow alongside Amazon and Microsoft, Ido Caspi, a research analyst at Global X ETFs, wrote in an email. \u201cIncreasing enterprise AI workloads will continue to bolster cloud revenues,\u201d Caspi said.\nGoogle is making progress in addressing investor concerns about the billions it spends on AI infrastructure and research. Pichai said on a conference call with investors after the report that Google reduced the cost of producing AI answers in search queries by over 90% in 18 months, \u201cthrough hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs,\u201d while doubling the size of Gemini, the generative artificial intelligence model powering the answers.\nStory Continues\nThe company is also investing heavily in new forms of power, including nuclear, to handle the future load of AI\u2019s progress, Pichai said. And it\u2019s leaning on the technology to help it work more efficiently: More than a quarter of Alphabet\u2019s new computer code is written by AI, Pichai said.\nAlphabet\u2019s Other Bets, an eclectic collection of nascent businesses including the self-driving car effort Waymo and the life sciences unit Verily, reported $388 million in revenue, up from $297 million in the year-ago quarter. Waymo, which Alphabet has poured money into for more than a decade, has been rapidly expanding the number of rides it offers in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. The company said last week it had raised $5.6 billion in its largest-ever funding round.\nThe Other Bets division remains unprofitable, losing $1.1 billion in the quarter, but Alphabet has been working to narrow those losses. Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s former longtime CFO who famously instilled a greater spirit of fiscal discipline in the company, recently transitioned into a new role as president and chief investment officer.

We\u2019ll spot-check a few key companies reporting after the closing bell:\n\n\nAlphabet Spells Big Q3 Beats\n\n\nGoogle and YouTube parent Alphabet GOOGL reported earnings of $2.12 per share, nicely ahead of the $1.83 in the Zacks consensus, and well beyond the $1.55 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues, minus Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), came in at $74.45 billion in the quarter, improving on the $72.85 billion anticipated (Alphabet had reported headline revenues at $88.27 billion).\n\nMost segments were modestly or notably above consensus expectations in Q3. Search Revenue reached +$49.4 billion ($49 billion had been expected), YouTube brought in $8.92 billion (versus $8.89 estimated) and Cloud fetched $11.4 billion versus $10.9 billion. Shares are up nearly +5% on the news, adding to its +22% year to date.\n\n\nAMD Trading Down on Modest Earnings Beat\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD outpaced bottom-line earnings by a penny to 92 cents per share, with a stronger top-line outperformance: $6.82 billion versus $6.71 billion in the quarter. But with Gaming revenue missing expectations, and a slightly lower guide on next-quarter sales, AMD shares are down -6% in today\u2019s after-market, cutting into the stock\u2019s +20% gain year to date.\n\n\nChipotle Posts Mixed Results, Shares Lower\n\n\nChipotle CMG posted a two-cent beat on its bottom line this afternoon, to 27 cents per share, but the fast casual giant brought its first top-line miss since July of last year. Same-store sales came in at +6%, a tad lower than the +6.3% estimate. The company listed higher avocado and dairy prices for the quarter, which were cited as the reason for the miss. Shares are down -2.5% in late trading, rolling back some of the +34% year-to-date gains.\n\n\nVisa, Which Never Misses on Earnings, Beats Again\n\n\nIn its fiscal Q4 reported today, Visa V typically surpassed estimates on its bottom line to $2.71 per share (from $2.58 in the Zacks consensus) on $9.62 billion in quarterly sales, nicely ahead of the $9.51 billion analysts had been expecting. Payments volume rose +8% in the quarter, while the company has a host of other issues, including 1400 pending job cuts and an antitrust lawsuit filed against Visa by the Department of Justice a month or so ago. Shares are up +1.5% in late trading, adding to the sub-S&P +9% year to date.\n\n\nStory Continues\nReddit Swings to Surprise Earnings, Shares +18%\n\n\nIt\u2019s only the third reported quarter for Reddit RDDT since its IPO, but the digital communities provider swung to a big positive on its bottom line \u2014 from an expected -7 cents per share to positive +16 cents for its Q3. Revenues of $348 million stormed past the $313 million in the Zacks consensus, +68% year over year. Next-quarter revenue guidance is screaming ahead to a range of $389-400 million from the earlier expected $360 million. Shares are up +17% on the news.\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author? Click here>>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That represents a profit and sales increase from the same period last year of 37% and 15%, respectively.\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAnalysts were anticipating earnings per share of $1.83 on revenue of $86.44 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAdvertising revenue topped $65.85 billion versus analysts' expectations of $65.5 billion, up from the year-ago period's $59.65 billion.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of the cloud unit in an earnings call Tuesday, noting that the company's AI portfolio is attracting new customers and leading to larger deals. Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, surpassing expectations.\n\u201cThis business has real momentum, and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace gen. AI,\" he said.\nThe run-up in cloud revenue comes as rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are also expected to grow their cloud businesses and ramp up investments in AI infrastructure. Google plans spend roughly $13 billion on capital expenditures for the current quarter, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the call. And the company anticipates another increase in AI and data infrastructure spending in 2025.\nGoogle also faces competition on its home turf with the introduction of increasingly sophisticated AI-powered chatbots. On Monday the Information reported that Meta (META) is developing its own search engine to drive its Meta AI chatbot, providing users with conversational answers to their questions and prompts.\nHow the next generation of answer engines compete with Google's traditional and AI-boosted search remains a key question for the company.\nPichai framed the expansion of AI search tools as boosting the user experience. AI Overviews, Google's search feature that offers concise answers to user queries, now reaches 1 billion users on a monthly basis, the company announced Monday.\n\u201cPeople are asking longer and more complex questions and exploring a wider range of websites,\" Pichai said. \"What's particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn that Google can answer more of their questions.\"\nSimilar to legacy search results, users are shown advertisements that Google places alongside AI Overviews.\nStory Continues\nGoogle is the first of the Big Tech platforms to report this week, with Meta and Microsoft set to release quarterly results on Wednesday, followed by Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL).

Reddit was also profitable on a GAAP basis for the first time since going public, Chief Executive Officer Steve Huffman said in an interview.\nReddit\u2019s shares had already more than doubled in value before its report on Tuesday, which pushed them to a new high close to three times their initial price.\nThe company has been investing in advertising technology to help it better monetize its large audience, an investment that is showing signs of paying off in its latest report. Reddit also projected sales for the holiday quarter between $385 million and $400 million, beating analysts\u2019 projections of $356 million.\n\u201cOur hypothesis of Reddit, which is that every company\u2019s customers are on Reddit somewhere, plays out,\u201d said Huffman. \u201cWe\u2019ve been more successful in helping businesses be on Reddit, find their customers on Reddit and land their messaging.\u201d\nReddit went public nearly two decades after the forum-based site was founded. Since the spring, the social media platform has been investing heavily in its ads business as it seeks to better compete with rivals Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. It has so far launched several new ad formats, including shopping and video ads, and it has signed content partnerships with major sports leagues that in turn could help draw advertisers.\nReddit is also striking deals with artificial intelligence companies as a way to diversify its business beyond advertising. The company has data-licensing agreements with Google, OpenAI and other AI developers, who use the site\u2019s data for training large language models. In January, Reddit signed licensing deals worth $203 million in total, covering the next several years.\nHuffman said the company will continue to have more conversations with potential licensing partners, but did not name specific companies.\nThe social media site also benefits from agreements with Google and OpenAI that allow Reddit results to appear in Google searches and in ChatGPT responses. This year in the US, the word \u201cReddit\u201d was the sixth-most searched word on Google, Huffman said. Reddit averaged 97.2 million daily active unique visitors in the September quarter, up 47% from the same time last year.\nStory Continues\n(Updates with scale of share price move and additional details)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Revenue, excluding partner payouts, increased to $74.6 billion, up about 16% from the year-ago quarter and surpassing the $72.9 billion analysts predicted on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income was $2.12 per share, the company said Tuesday in a statement, compared with estimates of $1.84 per share.\nAs its main search business matures, Google is betting on growth from its cloud division, which supplies computing power, software and services to other companies. Google is drawing more cloud customers using its AI expertise to gain ground on larger rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, making inroads by signing on fast-growing AI startups \u2014 some of which were founded by former Googlers \u2014 as clients.\n\u201cIn cloud, our AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers, attract new customers and win larger deals,\u201d Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in the statement.\nAlphabet shares rose more than 5% in extended trading following the report. The stock has gained 21% this year.\nSales in the cloud division jumped to $11.4 billion, a 35% rise from the year-ago period and better than analysts had projected. Google is third in the market, but there is room for it to grow alongside Amazon and Microsoft, Ido Caspi, a research analyst at Global X ETFs, wrote in an email. \u201cIncreasing enterprise AI workloads will continue to bolster cloud revenues,\u201d Caspi said.\nGoogle is making progress in addressing investor concerns about the billions it spends on AI infrastructure and research. Pichai said on a conference call with investors after the report that Google reduced the cost of producing AI answers in search queries by over 90% in 18 months, \u201cthrough hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs,\u201d while doubling the size of Gemini, the generative artificial intelligence model powering the answers.\nStory Continues\nThe company is also investing heavily in new forms of power, including nuclear, to handle the future load of AI\u2019s progress, Pichai said. And it\u2019s leaning on the technology to help it work more efficiently: More than a quarter of Alphabet\u2019s new computer code is written by AI, Pichai said.\nAlphabet\u2019s Other Bets, an eclectic collection of nascent businesses including the self-driving car effort Waymo and the life sciences unit Verily, reported $388 million in revenue, up from $297 million in the year-ago quarter. Waymo, which Alphabet has poured money into for more than a decade, has been rapidly expanding the number of rides it offers in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. The company said last week it had raised $5.6 billion in its largest-ever funding round.\nThe Other Bets division remains unprofitable, losing $1.1 billion in the quarter, but Alphabet has been working to narrow those losses. Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s former longtime CFO who famously instilled a greater spirit of fiscal discipline in the company, recently transitioned into a new role as president and chief investment officer. She is expected to focus more on overseeing the company\u2019s Other Bets portfolio.\nWhile Google builds its prominence in the AI industry, the US government is evaluating its major successes \u2014 search and digital advertising \u2014 for antitrust harm. In August, a US judge declared Google\u2019s search business an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department and a group of states also allege that Google has monopolized the market for advertising technology tools used by websites and advertisers to buy and sell online display ads.\nOn the earnings call with investors, Pichai warned that the US government\u2019s resolution of the antitrust cases could have \u201cunintended consequences\u201d for US leadership in tech.\nEither way, \u201cit\u2019s very clear that Google can perform even in the midst of serious regulatory threats to its ads business,\u201d said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, digital advertising and media analyst at Emarketer.\nIn her first earnings call with the company, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi, who joined earlier this year, said she expects Google\u2019s capital expenditures to increase considerably next year.\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov.\n(updates with details from second paragraph and commentary on capex in last paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, surpassing expectations.\n\u201cThis business has real momentum, and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace gen. AI,\" he said.\nThe run-up in cloud revenue comes as rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are also expected to grow their cloud businesses and ramp up investments in AI infrastructure. Google plans spend roughly $13 billion on capital expenditures for the current quarter, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the call. And the company anticipates another increase in AI and data infrastructure spending in 2025.\nGoogle also faces competition on its home turf with the introduction of increasingly sophisticated AI-powered chatbots. On Monday the Information reported that Meta (META) is developing its own search engine to drive its Meta AI chatbot, providing users with conversational answers to their questions and prompts.\nHow the next generation of answer engines compete with Google's traditional and AI-boosted search remains a key question for the company.\nPichai framed the expansion of AI search tools as boosting the user experience. AI Overviews, Google's search feature that offers concise answers to user queries, now reaches 1 billion users on a monthly basis, the company announced Monday.\n\u201cPeople are asking longer and more complex questions and exploring a wider range of websites,\" Pichai said. \"What's particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn that Google can answer more of their questions.\"\nSimilar to legacy search results, users are shown advertisements that Google places alongside AI Overviews.\nStory Continues\nGoogle is the first of the Big Tech platforms to report this week, with Meta and Microsoft set to release quarterly results on Wednesday, followed by Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL).

Find out in our full research report.\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Q3 CY2024 Highlights:\nRevenue: $88.27 billion vs analyst estimates of $86.22 billion (2.4% beat)\nOperating Profit (GAAP): $28.52 billion vs analyst estimates of $26.69 billion (6.9% beat)\nEPS (GAAP): $2.12 vs analyst estimates of $1.85 (14.8% beat)\nGoogle Search Revenue: $49.39 billion vs analyst estimates of $49.15 billion (small beat)\nGoogle Cloud Revenue: $11.35 billion vs analyst estimates of $10.87 billion (4.5% beat)\nYouTube Revenue: $8.92 billion vs analyst estimates of $8.87 billion (small beat)\nGoogle Services Operating Profit: $30.86 billion vs analyst estimates of $28.64 billion (7.7% beat)\nGoogle Cloud Operating Profit: $1.95 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.12 billion (73.4% beat)\nOperating Margin: 32.3%, up from 27.8% in the same quarter last year\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 20%, down from 29.5% in the same quarter last year\nMarket Capitalization: $2.06 trillion\nKey Topics & Areas Of Debate\nAI is likely the hottest topic in the world of investing today. Regarding Alphabet, the debate is about how AI\u2019s advancement will impact the company\u2019s bread-and-butter Search business. It is a business where Alphabet has dominant market share, and it is also highly profitable.\nWill the development of AI hurt Alphabet because OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and even Microsoft\u2019s Bing will take market share from Google, once thought to be nearly invincible in the online search market? Or will Alphabet\u2019s Gemini product, first announced in December 2023, allow the company to dominate the Search market for years or even decades to come given its brand recognition?\nAs background, Gemini is designed to advance natural language understanding and meet certain thresholds in conversational and contextual understanding. In short, it is meant to provide even more accurate and personalized results, which would be a replay of what made Google so successful decades ago.\nDespite its scale and dominance, Alphabet doesn\u2019t operate in a vacuum. ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) new and improved Bing engine are current competitors to Google Search while Meta (NASDAQ:META) is extending beyond social media and into the online search market with its AI-powered assistant.\nAlphabet runs into Microsoft often, as it is also one of its primary adversaries in the public cloud services market along with Amazon\u2019s formidable AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN). Finally, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Disney (NYSE:DIS), and many other video streaming platforms go head-to-head against the company\u2019s YouTube segment.\nStory Continues\nRevenue Growth\nAlphabet proves that huge, scaled companies can still grow quickly. The company\u2019s revenue base of $155.1 billion five years ago has more than doubled to $339.9 billion in the last year, translating into an incredible 17% annualized growth rate.\nAlphabet\u2019s growth over the same period was also higher than its megacap peers, Amazon (19.1%), Microsoft (14.3%), and Apple (8.3%). Comparing the four is relevant because investors often pit them against each other to derive their valuations. With these benchmarks in mind, we think Alphabet\u2019s price is attractive.\nQuarterly Revenue of Megacap Tech Companies\nLong-term growth reigns supreme in fundamentals, but for megacap tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss emerging trends like AI. Alphabet\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 9.8% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were good and suggest demand was strong.\nAlphabet Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\nThis quarter, Alphabet reported year-on-year revenue growth of 15.1%, and its $88.27 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.4%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 10.6% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is healthy for a company of its scale and illustrates the market sees some success for its AI-enabling products.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\nGoogle Search: Alphabet\u2019s Bread-and-Butter\nThe most topical question surrounding Alphabet today is: \u201cWill new Generative-AI products like ChatGPT disrupt Google Search and its 80%+ market share?\u201d.\nWe can gain further insight by comparing Google Search to Meta and Microsoft\u2019s Bing. Meta is Alphabet\u2019s equivalent in social media advertising and is creeping into search with Meta AI, powered by the Llama large language model. Bing is a more direct competitor and benefits from its integration with ChatGPT through Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI, though it is the distant number two player.\nGoogle Search is by far the most considerable portion of Alphabet\u2019s revenue at 56.5%, and it grew at a 15.3% annualized rate over the last five years, slower than total revenue. The previous two years also saw deceleration as it grew 8.5% annually.\nWhen looking across the competitive landscape, its two-year result was lower than Meta\u2019s 12%. This shows digital advertising dollars could be flowing to social media because of Meta\u2019s improved AI algorithms and targeting capabilities. Alphabet bulls would argue this trend could reverse because the return on investment from keyword-driven advertising is more tangible, but that hasn\u2019t been the case lately.\nGoogle Search and Meta Quarterly Revenue\nQuarterly performance is particularly relevant for Alphabet because it captures the growth of AI and signals whether investors are overestimating its competitive impact. Google Search revenue met Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimates in Q3 and recorded a year-on-year increase of 12.2%.\nWhile this was slower than Bing\u2019s 16%, it\u2019s important to consider that Bing is starting from a much smaller revenue base and doesn\u2019t pose a significant threat yet. Still, Alphabet must either start topping Google Search projections or outperform in other segments like Google Cloud Platform and YouTube to satisfy Wall Street.\nKey Takeaways from Alphabet\u2019s Q3 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Alphabet exceed analysts\u2019 revenue, operating income, and EPS expectations this quarter. The segments themselves were also all solid, with Search, YouTube, and Cloud all exceeding revenue estimates. Operating profit at the segments also beat.\u00a0Guidance will be provided on the call, which could further move the stock.\u00a0Zooming out, we think this quarter was quite good. The stock traded up 3.7% to $176 immediately following the results.\nIndeed, Alphabet had a rock-solid quarterly earnings result, but is this stock a good investment here?What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nTom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management Group, states that the two things to look for in the earnings season are consumer spending and companies' spending on technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Recent reports from the financial sector and retailers suggest that consumers are in good financial shape, setting the stage for a promising holiday season as well as providing a solid opportunity for growth in the fourth quarter. He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nSometimes, these AI-related names are a bit overvalued and there is volatility; but the long-term thesis remains strong. In fact, these \u201cdown days\u201d can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major \u201cAI arms race\u201d is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings.\nJust like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn\u2019t surprised by recent market developments. It\u2019s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is \u201ceasy to hope\u201d that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, \u201creaffirms that confidence\u201d.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents.\n\u201cWe think every company in the world, whether it\u2019s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.\u201d -Taylor told CNBC in an interview.\nIn other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo\u2019s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both.\n\"Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety.\" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company\u2019s Master Perfumer\nAdvancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI\u2019s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company:\n\u201cNeither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\u201d.\nWith that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (\nsee more details here\n).\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Critiques Google\u2019s Open Cloud Coalition, Accusing it of Astroturfing Tactics\nPixabay/Public Domain\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational technology company engaged in the development and selling of software, services, and hardware. The company's AI strategy is driven by its collaboration with OpenAI, its cloud computing infrastructure, and an ever-expanding suite of AI-driven solutions.\nOn October 28, an executive from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) took to their blog to reveal the forthcoming launch of a new lobby group called the Open Cloud Coalition, which includes Google and several smaller cloud providers, to gain favor with policymakers and antitrust regulators in Europe. Microsoft has learned that Nicky Stewart will lead the organization, previously authoring complaints against Microsoft and Azure Web Services in the UK Competition and Market Authority\u2019s investigation in the cloud computing market. These \u201cshadow campaigns\u201d by Google are \u201cdesigned to discredit Microsoft with competition authorities, and policymakers and mislead the public\u201d. Labeling them as an \u201castroturf group organized by Google,\u201d Rima Alaily - CVP, Deputy General Counsel at Microsoft alleges that Google had \u201cgone through great lengths to obfuscate its involvement, funding, and control\u201d by positioning smaller European cloud providers as the face of the coalition while keeping itself at the backseat.\n\u201cIt seems Google has two ultimate goals in its astroturfing efforts: distract from the intense regulatory scrutiny Google is facing around the world by discrediting Microsoft and tilt the regulatory landscape in favor of its cloud services rather than competing on the merits\u201d. -Alaily said.\nA Google spokesperson has acknowledged its membership in the coalition and stated the following:\n\u201cWe and many others believe that Microsoft\u2019s anticompetitive practices lock-in customers and create negative downstream effects that impact cybersecurity, innovation, and choice\u201d -Google spokesperson\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Eventually, the models will be incorporated into the main part of the GitHub Copilot assistant, which can spit out code with a few simple prompts.\nAfter teaming up with OpenAI a few years ago, GitHub pioneered the use of generative artificial intelligence to automate tedious parts of the coding process. The company will continue to make the OpenAI models the default setting, but developers will be able to switch to the Google and Anthropic models if they wish, GitHub Chief Executive Officer Thomas Dohmke said in an interview.\nSince acquiring GitHub in 2018, Microsoft has let the coding platform maintain a wide array of partnerships \u2014 even if they\u2019re technically Microsoft rivals. GitHub is keen to offer customers choice and to provide options to those who use Google\u2019s and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud services. The Anthropic model will run on the network operated by Amazon Web Services.\nMicrosoft also lets its Azure cloud customers use models other than OpenAI\u2019s, including ones from Meta Inc. and Mistral, but doesn\u2019t offer models from Google or Anthropic.\nGitHub also said it\u2019s previewing an AI project called Spark that lets users create mini applications, say building a travel log with maps or an event RSVP tracker, using plain-English prompts rather than programming code.\nUsers who know how to program, can also open up the code generated by Spark and tweak it, toggling between coding and prompts. The idea is to give novices a way to create something and more experienced developers an easier way to test out ideas, Dohmke said. Developers who want to take their Spark projects further will have to move them to a fuller software development program, like GitHub Copilot or Microsoft\u2019s Power Platform.\nStill, software development with AI is becoming more capable, he said.\n\u201cThe size of the Lego blocks that Copilot on AI can generate has grown and it can assemble multiple Lego blocks together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly cannot write a whole GitHub or a whole Facebook, but the size of the building blocks will increase with AI getting better.\u201d\nStory Continues\nRead this next: AI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating\u2014With Big Consequences\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "By David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said on Monday it sued Delta Air Lines in U.S. District Court in Georgia after a faulty software update prompted a global outage in July.\nThe July 19 incident led to worldwide flight cancellations and hit industries including banks, healthcare, media companies and hotel chains.\nCrowdStrike said it sued to make clear that CrowdStrike did not cause the harm that Delta claims, and that Delta repeatedly refused assistance from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. Delta did not immediately comment on CrowdStrike's suit.\nCrowdStrike is seeking a declaratory judgment plus legal fees.\nDelta's lawsuit filed on Friday in Fulton County Superior Court called the faulty software update from CrowdStrike \"catastrophic\" and said the company \"forced untested and faulty updates to its customers, causing more than 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to crash.\"\nDelta said the faulty update caused 7,000 flight cancellations, disrupted travel plans of 1.3 million customers and cost the carrier more than $500 million.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit, also filed on Friday, said Delta's own response and technology caused delays in the carrier's ability to resume normal operations.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit reiterated its contention that it has minimal liability, something Delta rejected.\nDelta said CrowdStrike is liable for over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses as well as for unspecified lost profits, expenditures - including legal fees - reputational harm and future revenue loss.\nThe incident prompted the U.S. Transportation Department to open an investigation.\n\"If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed,\" Delta's lawsuit says.\nDelta said it has invested billions of dollars in information technology licensing and infrastructure.\nLast month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologized before Congress for the faulty software update.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nIn a recent Tech Check program, CNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI\u2019s head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries.\nAs reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide \u201cmathematically precise and reproducible answers\u201d by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations.\n\u201cThink of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data \u2014 cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result\u201d.\nDespite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly \u201challucinating\u201d. OpenAI may deem it to have near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy\u201d, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments. A University of Michigan researcher found hallucinations in 80% of the audio transcriptions he examined during a study of public meetings.\nStory Continues\nSuch mistakes could have \u201creally grave consequences,\u201d particularly in hospital settings\u2026Nobody wants a misdiagnosis\u201d and that \u201cThere should be a higher bar.\u201d\nWith that, let's look at the 15 recent AI news that nobody should miss.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Non-fuel expenses amounted to $170 million, while fuel costs were $50 million lower than they would have been had the flights not been cancelled. Third-quarter per-share profit was also dented by $0.45.\n\"Because the faulty update could not be removed remotely, CrowdStrike crippled Delta's business and created immense delays for Delta customers,\" the airline said in its lawsuit.\nAmid the fallout from the outage, Delta brought on David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner to seek damages from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft, including compensation for losses and litigation expenses related to the matter.\nIn a statement late on Friday cited by Reuters, CrowdStrike said Delta's claims were based on \"disproven misinformation\" and \"demostrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works.\" The lawsuit was a \"desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure,\" CrowdStrike added.\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\nRelated Articles\nCrowdStrike shares slightly lower premarket amid Delta lawsuit over summer outage\nMorgan Stanley explains why rates are rising\nEuropean shares gain as key data and US tech earnings loom\nView Comments"

But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\nCheck out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhat's The Opportunity In CrowdStrike Holdings?\nGreat news for investors \u2013 CrowdStrike Holdings is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $420.23, but it is currently trading at US$301 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from CrowdStrike Holdings?\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. CrowdStrike Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRWD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CRWD for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy CRWD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nStory Continues\nIf you want to dive deeper into CrowdStrike Holdings, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n2024 has been a big year for AI breakthroughs, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Generative AI has arguably been the biggest trend, with McKinsey estimating that it could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries annually, based on 63 use cases they analyzed. Back in 2022, when OpenAI launched its free web app, ChatGPT, few could have predicted the scale of the AI revolution that would follow. Major tech giants have since followed suit, revealing their own chatbot-based assistants, AI-enabled phones, and much more.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and\u00a020 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\nAs AI continues to revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries to new heights, today\u2019s headlines reveal just how impactful these advancements can be. The question of the hour is, with all of these big AI breakthroughs, are regulators finally catching up with developers working on their next big AI projects? Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) is a global cybersecurity company that provides cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data. The company employs world-class AI and ML to detect and prevent modern threats with the speed and scale of the cloud.\nOn Tuesday, October 23, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

The partnership aims to deliver real-time threat detection and automated remediation for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and physical desktop environments, all while improving upon customers\u2019 digital work experience and productivity. The partnership, forming amid rising worldwide security threats, aims to combine CrowdStrike's AI-based endpoint security with Fortinet's network firewall technology to handle cyber-attacks.\nWhile endpoint security helps safeguard individual devices such as computers and phones, network firewalls help regulate incoming and outgoing network traffic. The combination of the two elements helps bridge the gap through collaboration, offering a holistic approach to cybersecurity, and allowing organizations to detect and respond to threats more efficiently across their entire IT infrastructure. It is also a reflection of the growing trend in the cybersecurity industry to consolidate and integrate security tools.\nOverall CRWD ranks 9th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI is working with Broadcom Inc. to develop a new artificial intelligence chip specifically focused on running AI models after they\u2019ve been trained, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThere Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC\u2019s Historic Meatpacking District\nNY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link\nInside NYC\u2019s Playbook for Getting Federal Grant Funds\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nThe AI startup and chipmaker are also consulting with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world\u2019s largest chip contract manufacturer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. OpenAI has been planning a custom chip and working on such uses for the technology for around a year, the people said, but the discussions are still at an early stage.\nOpenAI declined to comment. A representative for Broadcom didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and a TSMC spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on rumors and speculation. Reuters reported on OpenAI\u2019s ongoing talks with Broadcom and TSMC on Tuesday. The Information reported in June that Broadcom had discussed making an AI chip for OpenAI.\nThe process for taking a chip from design to production is long and expensive. OpenAI is less focused on graphics processing units, chips that are used to train and build generative AI models \u2014 a market that has been cornered by Nvidia Corp. Instead, it\u2019s looking for a specialized chip that will run the software and respond to user requests, a process called inference. Investors and analysts expect the need for chips to support inference will only grow as more tech companies use AI models to field more complex tasks.\nOpenAI may continue to research setting up its own network of foundries, or chip factories, one of the people said, but the startup has realized that working with partners on custom chips is a quicker, attainable path for now. Reuters earlier reported that OpenAI was pulling back from the effort of establishing its own chip manufacturing capacity.\nBroadcom shares closed up 4.2% to $179.24 in New York trading on Tuesday. Even before the latest gain, they were up 54% this year. TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares closed more than 1% higher.\nBroadcom is the largest designer of application-specific integrated circuits \u2014 chips designed to fit a single purpose specified by the customer. The company\u2019s biggest customer in this area is Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Broadcom also works with Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\nStory Continues\nWhen asked last month whether he has new customers for the business, given the huge demand for AI training, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that he will only add to his short list of customers when projects hit volume shipments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy product to deploy for any customer, and so we do not consider proof of concepts as production volume,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call.\nOpenAI\u2019s services require massive amounts of computing power to develop and run \u2014 with much of that coming from Nvidia chips. To meet the demand, the industry has been scrambling to find alternatives to Nvidia. That\u2019s included embracing processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and developing in-house versions.\nOpenAI is also actively planning investments and partnerships in data centers, the eventual home for such AI chips. The startup\u2019s leadership has pitched the US government on the need for more massive data centers and CEO Sam Altman has sounded out global investors, including some in the Middle East, to finance the effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stretch,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told Bloomberg Television on Monday. \u201cStretch from a capital perspective but also my own learning.

Currently, OpenAI has assembled a team of roughly 20 chip engineers, including experts with experience designing Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Together, they hope to develop OpenAI's first custom chip by 2026\u2014though that timeline is flexible.\nThe news on Tuesday sent Broadcom Inc. shares up 4% and TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares gained more than 1%.\nThe move reflects OpenAI's ongoing strategy to secure consistent chip supply and manage escalating costs, a challenge that other tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft have also faced in their AI ventures. This effort includes OpenAI\u2019s recent decision to integrate AMD chips, along with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, which continue to dominate the market but are in limited supply. In fact, tech giants have been literally begging Nvidia for more chips.\nAt a meeting with analysts last month, billionaire\u00a0Oracle\u00a0cofounder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said he and world\u2019s-richest-man Elon Musk took Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang out to dinner at\u00a0Nobu\u00a0Palo Alto and \u201cbegged\u201d for more GPUs.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "By Krystal Hu, Fanny Potkin and Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - OpenAI is working with Broadcom and TSMC to build its first in-house chip designed to support its artificial intelligence systems, while adding AMD chips alongside Nvidia chips to meet its surging infrastructure demands, sources told Reuters.\nOpenAI, the fast-growing company behind ChatGPT, has examined a range of options to diversify chip supply and reduce costs. OpenAI considered building everything in-house and raising capital for an expensive plan to build a network of factories known as \"foundries\" for chip manufacturing.\nThe company has dropped the ambitious foundry plans for now due to the costs and time needed to build a network, and plans instead to focus on in-house chip design efforts, according to sources, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss private matters.\nThe company's strategy, detailed here for the first time, highlights how the Silicon Valley startup is leveraging industry partnerships and a mix of internal and external approaches to secure chip supply and manage costs like larger rivals Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft. As one of the largest buyers of chips, OpenAI's decision to source from a diverse array of chipmakers while developing its customized chip could have broader tech sector implications.\nBroadcom stock jumped following the report, finishing Tuesday's trading up over 4.5%. AMD shares also extended their gains from the morning session, ending the day up 3.7%.\nOpenAI, AMD and TSMC declined to comment. Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOpenAI, which helped commercialize generative AI that produces human-like responses to queries, relies on substantial computing power to train and run its systems. As one of the largest purchasers of Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs), OpenAI uses AI chips both to train models where the AI learns from data and for inference, applying AI to make predictions or decisions based on new information.\nReuters previously reported on OpenAI's chip design endeavors. The Information reported on talks with Broadcom and others.\nOpenAI has been working for months with Broadcom to build its first AI chip focusing on inference, according to sources. Demand right now is greater for training chips, but analysts have predicted the need for inference chips could surpass them as more AI applications are deployed.\nBroadcom helps companies including Alphabet unit Google fine-tune chip designs for manufacturing and also supplies parts of the design that help move information on and off the chips quickly. This is important in AI systems where tens of thousands of chips are strung together to work in tandem.\nStory continues\nOpenAI is still determining whether to develop or acquire other elements for its chip design, and may engage additional partners, said two of the sources.\nThe company has assembled a chip team of about 20 people, led by top engineers who have previously built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) at Google, including Thomas Norrie and Richard Ho.\nSources said that through Broadcom, OpenAI has secured manufacturing capacity with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to make its first custom-designed chip in 2026. They said the timeline could change.\nCurrently, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs hold over 80% market share. But shortages and rising costs have led major customers like Microsoft, Meta, and now OpenAI, to explore in-house or external alternatives.\nOpenAI\u2019s planned use of AMD chips through Microsoft's Azure, first reported here, shows how AMD's new MI300X chips are trying to gain a slice of the market dominated by Nvidia. AMD has projected $4.5 billion in 2024 AI chip sales, following the chip's launch in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTraining AI models and operating services like ChatGPT are expensive. OpenAI has projected a $5 billion loss this year on $3.7 billion in revenue, according to sources. Compute costs, or expenses for hardware, electricity and cloud services needed to process large datasets and develop models, are the company's largest expense, prompting efforts to optimize utilization and diversify suppliers.\nOpenAI has been cautious about poaching talent from Nvidia because it wants to maintain a good rapport with the chip maker it remains committed to working with, especially for accessing its new generation of Blackwell chips, sources added.\nNvidia declined to comment.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York, Fanny Potkin in Singapore, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, additional reporting by Anna Tong and Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and David Gregorio)"

Although markets have been volatile over the past couple of weeks, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has been making a steady climb. On Oct. 25, the Nasdaq hit an all-time high, led by mega-cap stocks ahead of their upcoming earnings and the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).\nGiven the ongoing tech rally and expectations of more rate cuts this year, it would be ideal to invest in Nasdaq stocks such as Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW, whichhave strong potential for the near term. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNasdaq Hits Record High\nOn Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.6% to close at an all-time high of 18,518.61 points. The index also closed 0.2% higher for the week, recording its seventh straight week of gains, its longest winning streak for 2024.\nYear to date, the Nasdaq Composite has gained 23.4% after soaring 43.4% in 2023, recording its best year since 2020.\nTech stocks rallied last year after a lackluster 2022 when rising interest rates negatively impacted growth stocks. The rally has since continued and gathered steam this year, boosting the Nasdaq. The current rally is largely being fueled by stocks focused on artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, which is also helping the broader market.\nAI Enthusiasm Powering Tech Rally\nWhile AI experts' opinions, particularly on the future of generative AI, are divided, the optimism surrounding this field has been enormous over the past year. Many believe that AI is still in its early stages and that its full potential has yet to be tapped. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been a frontrunner in generative AI and has been pivotal in the surge in interest in this field. Its shares have soared 185.8% year to date.\nNVIDIA\u2019s solid progress in the generative AI space has seen several tech giants trying to leave a prominent footprint in that area. Also, the advancement of smart devices is supporting the field as they require computing and learning abilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analytics. These functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, which are all favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry.\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a strong recovery as a result, following a period of challenges until the first half of 2022.\nStory Continues\nAlso, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first since March 2020. This has been further aiding growth assets, especially tech stocks. Low interest rates typically have a positive impact on growth assets.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year.\nThe past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries\u2019 balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022.\nThe Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging.\nThe tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end.\nHowever, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year.\nThe aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent.\nComing back to tech \u2013 the industry wouldn\u2019t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown.\nWhat\u2019s Ahead for the Market?\nThe US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a\u00a0Financial Times\u2019 survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed\u2019s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession.\nStory Continues\nFor instance, Piper Sandler\u2019s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the \u201cjumbo\u201d rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn\u2019t avert the problem.\nHowever, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists\u2019 estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn\u2019t without historical precedent.\nFurther, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week\u2019s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024.\nMoving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is \u2018tactically bullish\u2019 on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets \u201cpricing in a soft landing\u201d. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end.\nWith regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said:\n\u201cI think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we\u2019re kind of underweight on software.\u201d\nRowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don\u2019t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up.\nMethodology\nFor our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom (AVGO): Leading with Custom Silicon and Strategic Acquisitions\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n3Y CAGR: 55.87%\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been one of the most profitable stocks in the S&P500 index over the past few years. The company has been very successful in its patent portfolio strategy by acquiring other tech companies by leveraged buyouts. Some of its recent acquisitions include CA Technologies and VMware, with VMware being especially prominent.\nFurther, Broadcom is the biggest player in the custom silicon market that lets other companies design their own AI accelerators, which are increasingly opting for specific chips for specific use cases.\nFollowing is what Clearbridge Large Cap Value strategy had to say about AVGO in their Q3, 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Broadcom is:\n8.4% = US$5.5b \u00f7 US$66b (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2024).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.\nDoes Broadcom Have A Good Return On Equity?\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Broadcom has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Semiconductor industry classification.\nroe\nUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Broadcom visit our risks dashboard for free.\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\nBroadcom's Debt And Its 8.4% ROE\nBroadcom clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.06. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\nStory Continues\nSummary\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\nOf course Broadcom may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, emphasized the ongoing significance of fossil fuels in supporting technological advancements, even as investments in renewable energy continue to increase. He stated:\n\u201cThis is not just a grudge match between the old and the new, a battle of electric vehicles versus internal combustion. The truth is, fossil fuels are essential for a lot more than vehicles, like it or not.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Stock Picks\nCramer highlighted the growing energy demands of major tech companies, noting that the data centers they are constructing consume vast amounts of electricity. While these tech giants are making substantial investments in nuclear energy, he pointed out that this power source is unlikely to significantly impact data centers for at least another decade due to the complexities of building nuclear facilities and community resistance to having them nearby.\n\u201cIf we need more energy, we\u2019re going to get it from what comes out of the ground \u2026 fossil fuels that will power the data center, specifically natural gas\u2026 You may be reluctant to invest in it, you might think who cares, but you need to know how vital all of this fossil fuel technology is to the growth of the Magnificent Seven.\u201d\nCramer also reflected on the shift in the U.S. energy landscape, recalling how the nation was once heavily reliant on OPEC for oil imports just two decades ago. Today, he pointed out, the U.S. produces over 13 million barrels per day, making it the largest oil producer globally and a net exporter. He mentioned the Permian Basin's unexpected resilience, continually producing despite earlier predictions of depletion.\nCramer noted that the decline of OPEC has transformed the geopolitical landscape. He referenced the 1973 oil crisis, triggered by OPEC's retaliation against U.S. support for Israel, which led to stagflation and economic turmoil. In contrast, he pointed out that despite Israel's current conflict, the U.S. economy is not experiencing stagflation or recession, resulting instead in a bull market. He attributed this stability to the industry, saying:\n\u201c... This industry that spent billions upon billions of dollars to try to be as low carbon as possible is the reason why oil prices have actually come down during this period. They've gotten so much production that OPEC is now powerless.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTurning his attention to the broader oil industry, Cramer explored the role of oil service companies that facilitate production, including offshore drillers. He recalled becoming optimistic about oil service stocks earlier in the year, anticipating higher energy prices but admitted that this expectation did not materialize due to economic concerns dampening oil and gas markets. Despite current investor reluctance toward oil service stocks, Cramer suggested that sentiment could shift over time, especially because of the Federal Reserve's recent rate cutting.\n\u201cNow that the FED is our friend and more rate cuts are on the table, that's good news for the industry. I am not worried about the election either. If Trump wins, maybe we're back to that \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d thing. If Harris wins, we get exactly what we've had the last four years. Not ideal for the industry but it's still led to record oil and gas production here in the United States.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 23 and 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Charitable Trust name, doing incredibly well\u2026 I like Broadcom, I like Hock Tan.\u201d\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) specializes in the design, development, and supply of semiconductor devices, building on a strong foundation in semiconductor innovation. In the third quarter, the company reported total revenue of $13.1 billion, marking a significant increase of 47% from the same period last year. A contributor to this growth has been the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products and services, which brought in $3.1 billion during the quarter.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects that AI will become a key driver of growth moving forward, projecting $3.5 billion in AI revenue for the upcoming fourth quarter. The company has found considerable success in providing custom AI accelerators, specialized chips designed to handle AI workloads, to major hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. In the third quarter, sales of these AI accelerators skyrocketed, increasing by three and a half times compared to the previous year.\nOn October 14, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $220 from $190 and maintained an Outperform rating. The firm forecasts tailwinds in artificial intelligence, custom silicon, and networking through 2025 and 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings.

Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man\u2019s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components.\nAs Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\"\nOverall AVGO ranks 4th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ServiceNow, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NOW a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $13.83.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.3%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.36 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for NOW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenues were US$2.8b, approximately in line with whatthe analysts expected, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$2.07, an impressive 31% ahead of estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for ServiceNow going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here..\nBefore you take the next step you should know about the 2 warning signs for ServiceNow that we have uncovered.\nHave feedback on this article?

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Good afternoon, everyone, I really appreciate you joining today. Because a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report, I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow is growth trajectory. First is elite level execution, with our Q3 results we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution.\nWe outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand. The defense logistics agency works with ServiceNow assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project. Bangkok de Brazil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation.\nThe Veterans Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the Veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI powered solutions to improve its colleague experience.\nAfter rolling out now assist globally, EY works with ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks to deliver faster resolutions for enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life saving mission.\nMercedes Benz work to its ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million.\nAlso, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 39.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $959.64 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,034.\nStory Continues\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Current remaining performance obligation, a measure of booked sales, increased 26% in the period ending Sept. 30. Both exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company makes applications that help companies organize and automate their personnel and information technology operations. Like its peers, ServiceNow is baking generative AI features into its products and offers a pricier tier with those tools.\nThe company\u2019s main generative AI assistant product, Now Assist, is the fastest-growing in company history, Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott said in an interview. The average contract premium for users of Now Assist is 30%, he added.\nThe shares hit a record high Thursday in New York, jumping about 6%. Investors were initially unimpressed with the results, with the stock trading down Wednesday evening. The shares had increased 28% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close. That\u2019s more than twice the rally seen in the iShares Expanded Software ETF, which is often used as a sector benchmark.\nThe results \u201cvalidate the company\u2019s rare standing in enterprise software,\u201d wrote Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup. He cited strong execution in a tough environment for tech spending and early monetization of generative AI.\nIn recent weeks, ServiceNow and software peers like Salesforce Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have begun emphasizing AI \u201cagents\u201d that can complete tasks without user supervision. Some customers are already trying ServiceNow\u2019s agents, which will be released more broadly next month, McDermott said. Once the agents are fully rolled out, they\u2019ll be priced differently from other products, McDermott added.\nFor the current quarter ending in December, ServiceNow projected subscription revenue of about $2.88 billion, just ahead of analyst estimates. The company expects near-term bookings to rise 21.5%.\nThis bookings guidance was effectively \u201cgood, but not great,\u201d Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note. He added that the company tends to issue conservative forecasts for the fourth quarter.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also announced the hiring of a leader from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Cloud for a prominent role. Amit Zavery will fill titles vacated earlier this year by CJ Desai as president, chief product officer and chief operating officer. Zavery will focus on product and engineering, McDermott said. His first-year compensation is targeted at about $2 million, with a $3 million signing bonus, according to a filing.\nDesai left the company in July after a complaint about a government contract and the hiring of a former US Army technology leader. He has since been tapped for a high-level executive role at Cloudflare Inc.\nLast month, Bloomberg reported that Carahsoft Technology Corp., a government-focused technology reseller, was under investigation alongside SAP SE for potentially conspiring to overcharge federal agencies.\nCarahsoft is also a major partner of ServiceNow\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re currently not involved in any issues related to Carahsoft and the US federal business,\u201d McDermott said when asked about the issue during a call with analysts Wednesday.\nProfit, excluding some items, was $3.72 per share, ahead of analyst estimates. The company saw a spike in large deals worth more than $5 million in annual contract value, it said.\nServiceNow hired more than 1,200 workers in the quarter. The company now has 25,743 employees. Much of the hiring is of quota-bearing sales representatives, which shows \u201cour confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Gina Mastantuono during the call.\n(Updates share reaction in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model.\n\u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 97\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0April 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cUS-based software company,ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW), provided another strong result, continuing its long and consistent track record of 20%-plus revenue growth combined with healthy profitability. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year to $2.5 billion and free cash flow grew 47% year-on-year to $1.2 billion. The company\u2019s core operating metrics were also impressive with remaining performance obligations growing 26% year-on-year to $17.7 billion (i.e. roughly 2x 2023 revenue) and renewal rates holding steady at 98%. Performance was evenly spread across segments, products, and geographies, with notable strength in the US federal government. The company now boasts 1,933 customers generating in excess of $1 million in Annual Contract Value (ACV), which is pleasing to see as it implies multiple solutions are involved and that the company\u2019s platform model is increasingly resonating with customers. In our view, ServiceNow is one the highest quality software businesses globally as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it a compelling opportunity.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

That represents a profit and sales increase from the same period last year of 37% and 15%, respectively.\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAnalysts were anticipating earnings per share of $1.83 on revenue of $86.44 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAdvertising revenue topped $65.85 billion versus analysts' expectations of $65.5 billion, and up from the year-ago period's $59.65 billion.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of the cloud unit in an earnings call Tuesday, noting that the company's AI portfolio is attracting new customers and leading to larger deals. Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, and surpassing expectations.\n\u201cThis business has real momentum and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace gen-AI,\" he said.\nThe run up in cloud revenue comes as rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are also expected to grow their cloud businesses and ramp up investments in AI infrastructure. Google plans spend roughly $13 billion on capital expenditures for the current quarter, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the call. And the company anticipates another increase in AI and data infrastructure spending in 2025.\nGoogle also faces competition on its home turf with the introduction of increasingly sophisticated AI-powered chatbots. On Monday the Information reported that Meta (META) is developing its own search engine to drive its Meta AI chatbot, providing users with conversational answers to their questions and prompts.\nHow the next generation of answer engines compete with Google's traditional and AI-boosted search remains a key question for the company.\nPichai framed the expansion of AI search tools as boosting the user experience. AI Overviews, Google's search feature that offers concise answers to user queries, now reaches 1 billion users on a monthly basis, the company announced Monday.\n\u201cPeople are asking longer and more complex questions, and exploring a wider range of websites,\" Pichai said. \"Whats particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn that Google can answer more of their questions.\"\nSimilar to legacy search results, users are shown advertisements that Google places alongside AI Overviews.\nStory Continues\nGoogle is the first of the Big Tech platforms to report this week, with Meta and Microsoft set to release quarterly results on Wednesday, followed by Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL).

This is expected to positively impact DAY\u2019s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nDAY recently launched the Dayforce Payroll in Singapore, which is expanding and capturing a new customer base in the Asia-Pacific region. This has opened up revenue opportunities in a growing market with a high demand for efficient payroll solutions. Third-quarter 2024 revenues are highly likely to have been positively impacted by this.\n\nDayforce has been strategic in targeting sectors like retail, manufacturing and hospitality, which demonstrates demand resilience. In a dynamic macroeconomic environment, such pivots can aid DAY in navigating economic uncertainties with ease. This bodes well for the company\u2019s bottom-line growth.\n\nWith the momentum from the second quarter, whereby revenues and profitability showed considerable improvement, Dayforce is poised to carry this into the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA growth, along with high free cash flow, demonstrates operational efficiency and solid financial health.\nWhat Our Model Says About DAY Stock\nAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

This could be due to fewer fears around market concentration, capex spending or valuations, compared with the last two quarters.\u201d\nInvestors will be closely watching the results and outlooks from the companies, which together represent more than 20% weighting in the S&P 500 index, after the stellar earnings reported by technology firms earlier in the year. The earnings will be followed next week by the closely contested US presidential election and Federal Reserve meeting, piling up a slew of potentially market-moving events for investors to protect against.\nBreaking it down a bit further, in five of the past eight quarters Apple\u2019s options implied a larger swing than was actually realized, while Microsoft options were more expensive in six of eight. On the other hand, Meta\u2019s swings have outpaced the implied moves more than half the time, sometimes by more than 10 percentage points.\nAlthough Nvidia Corp. doesn\u2019t report this week, investors will be watching capital spending outlooks closely, as four of the companies account for a large chunk of the chipmaker\u2019s sales. Near-term Nvidia option volatility edged higher on Monday.\nThe broader technology sector appears relatively inexpensive with earnings and the US election approaching, according to Goldman Sachs\u2019 derivatives sales trading desk, which sees Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (ticker QQQ) calls cheap relative to SPDR S&P 500 ETF trust (ticker SPY).\nStory Continues\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013October 29, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares CyberArk Software CYBR, as the Bull of the Day and Ulta Beauty ULTA, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s NVDA and Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI.\nHere is a synopsis of all three stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nCyberArk Software is a global leader in identity security. The company provides the most comprehensive security offering for any identity across business applications, distributed workforces, hybrid cloud environments, and throughout the DevOps lifecycle.\nAnalysts have taken a bullish stance on the company\u2019s earnings outlook, landing it into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nIn addition to favorable earnings estimate revisions, the stock resides in the Zacks Computers \u2013 IT Services industry, currently ranked in the top 20% of all Zacks industries. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.\nCyberArk Raises Guidance\nThe outlook for its current fiscal year has remained very bullish, with the $2.29 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up more than 60% over the last year and suggesting a sizable 105% growth rate year-over-year. Sales growth is also forecasted to be strong, with the $940 million expected 25% higher than FY23.\nShares saw a nice pop following its latest set of quarterly results, now trading at all-time highs. Stocks making new highs tend to make even higher highs, particularly when positive earnings estimate revisions are present.\nConcerning the above-mentioned print, CyberArk delivered record revenue and saw a profitability uptick, also outperforming its previous guidance across all metrics. The company is enjoying a snowball of demand, with Subscription revenue of $158.4 million nearly 50% higher than the year-ago figure.\nThe company raised its full-year guidance across the board following the print, explaining the positive share reaction post-earnings. The company\u2019s growth trajectory is expected to continue nicely, as shown below.\nThe valuation picture here is quite rich, but that\u2019s a reflection of investors\u2019 big growth expectations. Shares currently trade at an 11.4X forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio, well above the 9.1X five-year median but still beneath five-year highs of 14.2X.\nThe stock sports a Style Score of \u2018F\u2019 for Value. While the valuation picture may steer some away, the company\u2019s robust growth is undeniable.\nBottom Line\nInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank \u2013 one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.\nStory Continues\nThe top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.\nCyberArk Software would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nBear of the Day:\nUlta Beauty is a leading beauty retailer in the United States. The company offers a wide range of products, including cosmetics, fragrances, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores.\nAnalysts have taken a bearish stance on the stock\u2019s outlook, lowering their earnings expectations across the board and landing it into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\nIn addition, the company is in the Zacks Retail \u2013 Miscellaneous industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 42% of all Zacks industries. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the company.\nUlta Shares Disappoint\nULTA shares have been hit hard in 2024, down 23% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500. Quarterly results that have largely disappointed have been a driver behind the share plunge, with the stock not seeing a sustained post-earnings move higher following several periods.\nWhile the company\u2019s sales growth has been notably strong over recent years, regularly impressing the market, the growth rates have cooled significantly, as shown below. Please note that the chart below tracks the % YoY change in sales, not actual sales numbers.\nThe stock traded at high multiples for years thanks to its explosive growth, with the current 16.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple a bargain relative to five-year highs of 80.8X. Still, while the stock is historically cheap, waiting for positive earnings estimate revisions to hit the tape would be a better approach.\nBottom Line\nSlowing growth paints a challenging picture for the company\u2019s shares in the near term.\nUlta Beauty is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company\u2019s earnings outlook.\nFor those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) \u2013 these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.\nAdditional content:\nBuy Meta Platforms: Q3 Earnings Might Be a Game-Changer\nMeta Platforms Inc. is the world\u2019s largest social media platform. The company\u2019s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta\u2019s family of products.\nThe tech giant is set to release its third-quarter 2024 earnings results on Oct. 30, after the closing bell. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP of 2.83%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nOur research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better (Rank #1 or 2) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings release. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\nMeta Platforms is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence (AI). A section of financial experts raised questions about the timing of the monetization of these massive investments.\nA possible earnings and revenue beat will ensure META\u2019s ability to a great extent about AI spending monetization. This along with a favorable Zacks Rank should drive its stock price significantly in the near future.\nFactors to Be Considered for Third Quarter\nMeta Platforms is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.3 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching the 200 million user milestone.\nMETA is riding on strong advertising revenue growth prospects. In the second quarter of 2024, advertising revenues increased 21.7% year over year to $38.33 billion, accounting for 97.9% of revenues. Meta Platforms\u2019 advertising revenues are expected to benefit from strong spending from advertisers as they leverage its growing AI prowess.\nMETA has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads. META\u2019s significant investment in AI is expected to help it gain market share in the digital advertising space.\nKey metrics like Family daily active people, ad impressions and average price per advertisement are likely to remain solid on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, reflecting the dominant position of the company in the digital advertising market.\nHowever, the Meta Platforms Reality Labs division (which includes virtual reality, augmented reality and metaverse initiatives) has been a significant drag on profits. It remains to be seen how the company is approaching profitability for this segment and if massive investment in AI has aided this initiative.\nSolid Earnings Estimate Revisions for META Shares\nFor third-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently shows revenues of $40.16 billion, suggesting an improvement of 17.6% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.17, indicating an appreciation of 17.8% year over year. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters with the average beat being 12.6%.\nMoreover, META has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the last seven days. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 20% and 44.2%, respectively, for revenues and EPS in 2024.\nThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues and EPS reflects an upside of 14% and 13.3%, respectively. In addition, META has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 19.1%, significantly higher-than the S&P 500 index\u2019s growth rate of 13.1%.\nMore Catalysts for META Stock\nMeta Platforms is set to receive initial shipments of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s new flagship AI chip later this year. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META is set to get B200 Blackwell chips.\nMETA\u2019s AI-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms.\nManagement said that the company will invest $37-$40 billion as capital expenditure in AI initiatives in 2024. Moreover, capital spending is likely to reach more than $50 billion in 2025.\nOn July 24, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA\u2019s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbent like Open AI.\nOn Oct. 24, Meta Platforms entered into a multi-year deal with Thomson Reuters Corp. \u00a0to allow its AI chatbot access to news content for responses to current events and news questions. This constitutes a significant AI partnership between a tech behemoth and a news publishing giant.\nStrong Upside Left for META Shares\nYear to date, the stock price of Meta Platforms soared nearly 62%, well above the Zacks defined Internet Software Industry\u2019s gain of 23.1%. Despite this, META is currently trading at an attractive valuation compared to its peers. The stock has a forward price/earnings (P/E) of 26.5X, below the industry\u2019s P/E of 32.9X. META has a robust return on equity of 34.2%.\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 9.1% from the last closing price of $573.25. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $425-$811. This indicates a maximum upside of 41.5% and a maximum downside of 25.9%.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

          "whole_article": "Microsoft (MSFT) is at the forefront of the AI arms race, boasting an exceptional business model that consistently generates substantial and growing free cash flow. With the company\u2019s current valuation appearing fair, now may be an opportune time to buy its shares. I have a 12-month price target of $482.40, while the average Wall Street price target is $503.27. Therefore, I am decidedly bullish on MSFT stock, both in the short and long term.\nMicrosoft Should Not Be Underestimated in AI\nI am particularly bullish on Microsoft because it is widely recognized as a global leader in AI. Based on my analysis, Microsoft is likely at the forefront of the AI market, as demonstrated by its $10 billion commitment to ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This investment has enabled groundbreaking products like\u00a0Microsoft Copilot,\u00a0which integrates AI into its Office suite to improve productivity for millions of users. Notably, ChatGPT reached one million users in less than five days and 100 million users in about two months\u2014a feat of unprecedented growth.\nFurthermore, Microsoft, alongside partners like BlackRock (BLK), is involved in the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, which aims to raise up to $100 billion to develop data centers and energy infrastructure supporting AI operations. This partnership aligns with Microsoft\u2019s long-term strategy to lead the global AI industry. In the medium term, investors can anticipate growth driven by AI integrated into Microsoft\u2019s cloud services (Azure).\nHowever, the industry is crowded with Big Tech competitors, including Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and the unexpected outperformer Meta (META). Among these, I consider Meta to pose the most significant competitive threat to Microsoft, as it has open-sourced its frontier AI models, enabling third parties to iterate on the source code and advance the technology more rapidly\u2014a strategy Microsoft has not adopted.\nMSFT Stock Is Attractive for Growth Investors\nOne of the primary reasons I view Microsoft as an outstanding long-term investment is its robust history of generating substantial free cash flow. At the time of this writing, the company\u2019s free cash flow margin exceeds 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last trailing 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments.\nWhile Microsoft may not appear as a value investment, it is reasonably priced, in my view, given its consistent revenue and earnings growth, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. I estimate a 13% normalized EPS growth over the next 12 months. Based on this forecast, I hold a price target of $482.40, estimating the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of approximately 36.\nStory Continues\nLooking further ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next five to 10 years. While this outlook requires purchasing the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price presents an opportunity. The company\u2019s forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only a 6.5% premium over its five-year average, while its forward diluted EPS growth rate has expanded by nearly the same amount, at 5.8%.\nMSFT Faces Potential Headwinds in the Long Term\nOne potential challenge to Microsoft\u2019s long-term growth in AI is that its adoption may be cyclical. Currently, demand for AI systems is high, prompting Microsoft and other Big Tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks\u2014potentially due to macroeconomic constraints\u2014a slowdown in growth is likely.\u00a0According to the TipRanks Risk Analysis tool, Microsoft faces 32% of its risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is above the sector average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny on data privacy and AI governance.\nGiven this outlook, I anticipate some volatility in Microsoft\u2019s growth trajectory over the long term, though it may be less pronounced than that of semiconductor companies like NVIDIA (NVDA). Periodic price and valuation dips coinciding with temporarily lower growth rates could provide more attractive buying opportunities as sentiment fluctuates.\nThere is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure.\u00a0With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft\u2019s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations.\u00a0This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.\nIs Microsoft a Buy, Hold or Sell?\nOn Wall Street, Microsoft receives a broadly positive outlook, with 26 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and no Sell ratings. The average MSFT price target is $503.27, reflecting a 17.5% upside potential over the next 12 months.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nThis positive sentiment reinforces the view that now may be a prudent time to invest in Microsoft, given its strong market position and leadership in AI.\nKey Takeaway: Microsoft Is a Leading AI Investment\nI am bullish on Microsoft due to its leadership in AI, supported by its significant stake in OpenAI. Additionally, the company has demonstrated consistent free cash flow growth, which is likely to strengthen its market leadership over the long term. Although Meta is a strong competitor in the AI landscape, I remain confident that Microsoft holds the leading position. Based on my analysis, MSFT stock is a Buy.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

META, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. TMO and Food Comes From, Inc. WFCF.\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nTop Analyst Reports for Meta, Tesla and Thermo Fisher\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc., Tesla, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Where Food Comes From, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+64.0% vs. +23.5%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone.\n\nIt witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\n\nShares of Tesla have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (+12.0% vs. -1.4%). The company\u2019s long-term growth prospects remain strong, driven by its thriving Energy Generation & Storage segment, expansive Supercharger network and AI advancements. Energy deployments are expected to double this year, thanks to the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products.\n\nTesla\u2019s robust balance sheet, with a high liquidity buffer, supports continued innovation and expansion. Progress in the autonomous vehicle domain, including plans to launch robotaxi services in 2025, position the company well for sustained growth.\n\nHowever, near-term pressure from high capex, stiff EV competition and margin challenges in the automotive segment pose risks. Still, Tesla\u2019s commitment toward clean energy, along with its pioneering technology and robust infrastructure, underpins our bullish long-term view of the stock.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s shares have gained +27.4% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry\u2019s gain of +33.4%. The company is braving the ongoing tough economic conditions by utilizing the PPI Business System, resulting in strong financial performance.\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s growth strategy has been bolstered by several recent product launches, including a pre-transplant risk assessment assay and the international CorEvitas Adolescent Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Registry in the third quarter. The consistent efforts to expand its bioproduction business look encouraging.\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s continuous efforts to prioritize its partnership with customers to drive innovation and improve patient care bode well. A strong solvency position is an added advantage. The raised 2024 EPS outlook also raises optimism. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in Life.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here >>>)\n\nShares of Where Food Comes From have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Services - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-18.5% vs. +20.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $60.85 million demonstrates strong revenue growth in its core verification services, up 13% year over year to $9.7 million in the first half of 2024, driven by the rising demand for transparency in food production.\n\nExpansions into the Upcycled Food Certification and biosecurity services position WFCF for growth, capitalizing on sustainability trends. The company\u2019s diversified revenue streams mitigate risks from cyclical industry pressures, such as challenges in the beef sector.\n\nYet, declining product sales, particularly in RFID tags, and rising SG&A expenses, which increased 13% year over year in second-quarter 2024, pose risks to profitability. The cyclical downturn in the cattle industry continues to pressure WFCF\u2019s revenues.

          "whole_article": "Elon Musk has become a central player in Donald Trump's 2024 campaign, and Democrats hope to turn that into a weakness for the GOP nominee.\nThe top super PAC supporting Kamala Harris, Future Forward USA Action, produced the two ads that were in the heaviest rotation among all ads on swing state screens in the first three weeks of October, according to the ad trackers at AdImpact.\nThey both highlight Trump's links to Musk and other rich donors.\nOne of the ads features a shot of Musk in a tuxedo as a Pennsylvania voter says \"the 1% don't serve anybody but themselves.\"\nThe anti-Musk campaign also appears to be ramping up amid some evidence that the Tesla (TSLA) CEO's popularity has notable limits among undecided voters.\nThe group has produced an even more Musk-centric ad that ran during a Pittsburgh Steelers game on Monday night and is part of a reported $100 million final ad blitz by the outside group.\nAn image from a recently released ad produced by Future Forward PAC, which is allied with Vice President Kamala Harris\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the formal Harris campaign jumped in after Musk posted on X in agreement with a controversial idea: That it's possible \"markets will tumble\" if Trump wins as a result partly of Musk cutting government (before things equalize and the country emerges on a more solid footing).\n\"Sounds about right,\" Musk posted.\nHarris-Walz 2024 rapid response director Ammar Moussa responded with a statement saying in part \"listen to Trump\u2019s billionaire backer and top surrogate Elon Musk [Trump would] tank our economy if he wins a second term.\"\n\"The Trump campaign has given Democrats a bit of a gift by highlighting Elon Musk,\" said Evan Roth Smith, a left-leaning pollster at Blueprint Interactive who has looked at the billionaire's impact.\nHe said the idea of Trump being \"a stooge for the wealthy and corporate America\" is a top performing message for Democrats among swing voters and it's a potential issue that \u201cdislodges some of these [Nikki] Haley Republicans who are skeptical of his tax policy.\u201d\nSmith has also polled on perceptions of Musk personally, focused on young male voters, and found that even this group's views of Musk were decidedly mixed.\nThe poll asked whether Musk's endorsement makes \"you more or less likely to support Trump?\" 24% of respondents answered more likely but slightly more, 28%, said less. A plurality of 45% said it would have no impact.\nThe results were even more stark among independent men of all ages, with 18% saying Musk moved them to Trump and 27% saying it moved them the other way.\nA non-scientific survey of Yahoo Finance users last week came to a similar overall result; 25% of respondents said Musk made them more likely to vote for Trump while almost 28% said he made them less likely.\nStory Continues\nA focus on Musk in the home stretch\nFor Trump's part, he doesn't appear to be ratcheting down his Musk mentions at all.\nPraise for the CEO is a staple of rally appearances, and Musk was the final speaker Sunday before Trump's wife Melania took the stage at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\nThat was an appearance where Musk spoke about his plans for a \"Department of Government Efficiency\" if Trump wins and claimed the effort could save the US $2 trillion. He offered no details about how he would find such savings, which would represent more than all discretionary spending in the US budget.\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk exults as he steps on stage during a rally for Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden in New York on October 27. (ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images\nIn addition to a possible role with Trump, Musk has been center stage on multiple other fronts in recent weeks in ways that could raise questions with voters.\nThere is growing evidence, in reports from both The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post released Tuesday, that the algorithm on Musk\u2019s social media site X, formerly Twitter, is being tilted towards conservative voices.\nMusk also still faces questions about another WSJ report that he is \"in regular contact\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nYet Musk has continued to command the spotlight with a steady stream of pro-Trump media posts and daily million dollar daily giveaways to registered swing state voters that is now the subject of a lawsuit from Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nThe mix of issues has led the Harris campaign to go out of its way in recent weeks to highlight Musk's role. Vice Presidential Nominee Tim Walz called Musk Trump's \"running mate\" at a recent stop.\nOf course, many opinions are mixed on Musk's influence.\nPennsylvania Democratic Senator John Fetterman, who supports Harris and won a hard fought contest in the commonwealth two years ago, underlines that Musk has a lot of appeal.\n\"I mean, to a lot of people, that's Tony Stark,\" he recently told the New York Times in reference to the \u201cIron Man\u201d protagonist. \"That's going to really matter.\"\nAn overall focus on billionaires\nAnd the focus in the home stretch on the campaign trail extends beyond Musk to a wide array of billionaires.\nTrump at recent stops has brought up other prominent CEOs, saying Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai have called him separately in recent days.\n\"Tim, I've got to get elected first,\" Trump said he told the Apple head about his concerns during a podcast interview with Patrick Bet-David.\nIt's unclear if those two tech CEOs are well-known enough to impact voters but Smith notes that his polling has found that, while billionaire name checks can be a negative for Republicans among independents, they can be a positive for Democrats like Kamala Harris who Trump constantly attacks as anti-business.\n\"Democrats highlighting the support of people like Mark Cuban and other business leaders helps assuage some of those fears,\" he said.\nMark Cuban after speaking at a campaign rally for Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in La Crosse, Wis. on Oct. 17. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIndeed, his group's polling provides some evidence of that. One October poll asked voters about a potential message from Trump that began with \"Elon Musk is a fantastic guy.\"\nIt was the least popular among 14 messages they tested.\nBy contrast, a more recent poll released just this week brought up another billionaire, Mark Cuban, and his argument that Donald Trump would be bad for the economy and Harris would be good for it.\nIt was much more popular among the swing state voters who will decide the election next week.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how U.S. policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. shares have gone nowhere for months, trailing Magnificent Seven peers as investors struggle to price risks confronting the company. It\u2019s a stretch to believe Tuesday\u2019s results will blow away those concerns.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThere Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC\u2019s Historic Meatpacking District\nNY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link\nInside NYC\u2019s Playbook for Getting Federal Grant Funds\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nThe Google parent\u2019s earnings, due after the close, are expected to show long-term growth trends remain intact. They could also offer new information about any tailwinds it is seeing from artificial intelligence.\nBut even a positive report may be overshadowed by worries over the unquantified cost of antitrust action, a headache dragging on the stock and making it inexpensive among tech megacaps. Plus, there will be scrutiny over whether Alphabet\u2019s dominant market share in internet search is at risk from other players in AI.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to shout out the company\u2019s valuation, but there are a lot of fears that are hard to quantify, which means you can\u2019t yet tell if it\u2019s a value or a value trap,\u201d said George Cipolloni, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. \u201cIt clearly looks cheap compared to the other Magnificent Seven, but you\u2019re being paid to take a lot of risk, relatively.\u201d\nAlphabet shares are up 2.2% over the past six months, the weakest performance among the megacaps. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index has risen 27% over that period. Shares of Alphabet rose 1.9% on Tuesday.\nAlphabet\u2019s results are expected to show revenue growth near 14% and net earnings expansion above 18%. Both these metrics are projected to hold above a double-digit pace over the subsequent years.\nThose healthy trends, coupled with Alphabet\u2019s more modest valuation, could mean a lower bar to clear this quarter. Jefferies wrote that Alphabet faces a \u201cless demanding set-up among megacaps\u201d going into earnings, and that the stock should \u201cgrind higher over time, driven by fundamentals, though fighting regulatory/antitrust headwinds.\u201d\nThe shares trade at 19 times estimated earnings, the cheapest among the Magnificent Seven cohort, and a discount to its 10-year average. In contrast, Microsoft Corp., the other major AI software play, trades near 31 times.\nAlphabet\u2019s fundamentals and valuation discount stand out among big tech, where investors are increasingly wary about the long-term growth outlook and demanding share-price multiples.\nStory Continues\nHowever, the discount also reflects the idiosyncratic risks confronting Alphabet. Antitrust regulation has emerged as a central headwind, ever since a federal judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search market.\nEarlier this month, the Justice Department told a federal judge it\u2019s considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations. While that is seen as unlikely, and Alphabet is expected to appeal more extreme punishments, the uncertainty could remain a long-term overhang.\nAlphabet is also among companies allocating billions of dollars to AI-related capital expenditure, something investors are increasingly wanting to see pay off in terms of improved growth and efficiency. Higher-than-expected spending was a reason the stock sold off in the wake of last quarter\u2019s results.\nWhile AI has boosted demand for the company\u2019s cloud-computing services, Alphabet is also on the defensive protecting its internet search market share from AI alternatives.\nNearly 80% of the company\u2019s 2023 revenue came from Google advertising, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Less than 11% was derived from Google cloud. On Monday, the Information reported that Meta Platforms Inc. is working on developing an AI search engine to reduce its dependence on Google.\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling to know how to handicap these overhangs, since I doubt judges will give Alphabet that lenient a path, and we don\u2019t know whether any erosion in market share will be manageable,\u201d said Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. \u201cThese concerns are becoming more real than ever in terms of impacting fundamentals.\u201d\nRoughly 83% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying Alphabet, a positive consensus that is nevertheless below megacap peers like Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., or Nvidia Corp., all of which have ratios near or above 90%. However, the average analyst price target points to upside near 20% for Alphabet over the coming 12 months, the highest among megacaps.\n\u201cThe regulatory headwind is unlikely to be removed in the near term, but in the meantime, Alphabet is a high-quality asset trading at a discount to the market even though it is outgrowing the market,\u201d Stucky said. \u201cThat\u2019s a reason to stick with it.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nApple Inc.\u2019s iPhone exports from India jumped by a third in the six months through September, underscoring its push to expand manufacturing in the country and reduce dependence on China.\nNEC Corp. plans to take its subsidiary NEC Networks & System Integration Corp. private, buying all the remaining shares in the company that it doesn\u2019t already own for as much as \u00a5235.5 billion ($1.5 billion).\nLiberal Democratic Party heavyweight Akira Amari\u2019s defeat in Japan\u2019s general election removes from parliament one of the chip sector\u2019s biggest advocates as concerns grow over the amount of taxpayer money getting plowed into the industry.\nThe Biden administration finalized restrictions on investments by US individuals and companies into advanced technology in China, including semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.\nApple Inc., heralding a \u201cnew era\u201d for its devices, started rolling out its first set of Apple Intelligence features and introduced a new 24-inch iMac desktop with an AI-focused M4 processor.\nIndian food-delivery platform Swiggy Ltd. is seeking to sell shares for as much as 390 rupees ($4.64) each in an initial public offering that may raise $1.35 billion, people familiar with the matter said.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nPremarket\nCorning\nZebra Tech\nCommVault\nIPG Photonics\nCTS\nPerfect\nShutterstock\nPostmarket\nAlphabet\nAMD\nElectronic Arts\nLiberty Global\nATN International\nSnap\nQorvo\nVaronis Systems\nLittelfuse\nMirion Technologies\nPros Holdings\nUnisys\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to afternoon trading.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nHow Elon Musk Came to Embrace the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $25.759 billion, suggesting 15.4% growth on a year-over-year basis.\nApple\u2019s Mac Sales to Fall Y/Y\nApple\u2019s Mac shipment is expected to have plunged 24.2% year over year in the third quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 5.3 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 7.8% compared with 10% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple\u2019s estimated shipment decline rate is the largest in IDC\u2019s vendor list, followed by Dell Technologies DELL, whose shipment declined 4%.

This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\n\nApple Intelligence will be first available in U.S. English and will be expanded quickly to include localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the U.K. in December.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nTom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management Group, states that the two things to look for in the earnings season are consumer spending and companies' spending on technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Recent reports from the financial sector and retailers suggest that consumers are in good financial shape, setting the stage for a promising holiday season as well as providing a solid opportunity for growth in the fourth quarter. He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nSometimes, these AI-related names are a bit overvalued and there is volatility; but the long-term thesis remains strong. In fact, these \u201cdown days\u201d can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major \u201cAI arms race\u201d is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings.\nJust like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn\u2019t surprised by recent market developments. It\u2019s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is \u201ceasy to hope\u201d that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, \u201creaffirms that confidence\u201d.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents.\n\u201cWe think every company in the world, whether it\u2019s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.\u201d -Taylor told CNBC in an interview.\nIn other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo\u2019s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both.\n\"Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety.\" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company\u2019s Master Perfumer\nAdvancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI\u2019s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company:\n\u201cNeither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\u201d.\nWith that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (\nsee more details here\n).\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Launches Apple Intelligence AI Tools for iPhone, Enhancing User Experience with Advanced Features\nPixabay/Public Domain\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American technology company engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide.

Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s personal intelligence system, is a suite of software tools that brings what the company describes as artificial intelligence to its devices.

Apple Intelligence is also available on Mac computers and iPad tablets that are powered by its latest chips.\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. overhauled the design of its Mac mini desktop computer for the first time in about 15 years, cutting the device\u2019s size to just 5 inches across and adding speedier M4 chips.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThere Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC\u2019s Historic Meatpacking District\nNY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link\nInside NYC\u2019s Playbook for Getting Federal Grant Funds\nA Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl\nThe Tartarian Candidate\nThe new models are less than half the size of the previous Mac mini design \u2014 introduced in 2010 by then Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs \u2014 making them closer to the dimensions of an Apple TV set-top box. Beyond the new chassis, which is 2 inches tall, the computers will run M4 and M4 Pro processors, part of a wave of Mac upgrades that feature that chip generation.\nApple is planning a week of Mac announcements, which started on Monday with the unveiling of an iMac with the M4. It also just rolled out Apple Intelligence, its new AI platform, for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nAs Bloomberg News previously reported, the new Mac mini features a pair of connectors on the front \u2014 matching the higher-end Mac Studio \u2014 as well as a slew of ports and other inputs on the back. The Mac mini continues to come in silver, matching prior generations. And the company touted the computer\u2019s ability to handle Apple Intelligence tasks, though older M1 and M2 versions also support the software.\nApple rolled out separate accessories on Monday that have USB-C connectors. Like prior models, the Mac mini doesn\u2019t come with a keyboard, mouse or trackpad in the box. The 1.5-pound computer only includes a power cable. It\u2019s available for preorder Tuesday and will be available in stores Nov. 8.\nThe new Mac mini models replace versions with M2 and M2 Pro chips that debuted in early 2023. The M4 edition comes with 10 cores each in both in its CPU, or central processing unit, and GPU, or graphics processing unit. It starts at $599, matching the price of the prior model. There\u2019s also a $799 version with the M4 that doubles the storage to half a terabyte.\nThe M4 Pro edition, the first Mac with this higher-end chip, starts at $1,399 \u2014 a $100 price increase from the M2 Pro model. The base version with that chip includes 12 CPU cores, 16 GPU cores, half a terabyte of storage and 24 gigabytes of memory. A top-of-the-line model with 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores is $1,599.\nFor the first time, the Mac mini includes 16 gigabytes of memory in the entry-level version \u2014 in line with the new base models of the iMac and upcoming MacBook Pro. Mac mini models with the M4 Pro also can be configured with 64 gigabytes of memory, a first for the product since Apple switched to in-house processors. They cap out at 8 terabytes of storage, like the prior versions.\nStory Continues\nThe Mac mini design includes two USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front of every model, as well as three Thunderbolt connectors on the back. The M4 versions use the Thunderbolt 4 standard, while the M4 Pro models use Thunderbolt 5, which doubles the throughput for faster data transfers.\nAll models also include the power connector, an HDMI port and an Ethernet jack on the back. The power button has been moved to the bottom.\n(Updates with additional Mac mini details starting in first paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) week of announcements continued Tuesday as the company took the wraps off of its newest Mac mini desktop computer and all-new M4 Pro chip, just ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season.\nThe news comes after Apple debuted its updated iMac desktop, complete with the company\u2019s M4 chip, on Monday.\nThe Mac mini, which is available for preorder today and on sale Nov. 8, starts at $599 and features a significantly smaller design, measuring just 5 inches by 5 inches, down from 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches. Despite the smaller footprint, Apple says the latest mini gets more horsepower than its predecessor.\nBesides the obvious holiday rush, the recent announcements come at an important time as the company moves to keep its momentum going.\nApple\u2019s Mac segment struggled in 2023, following a blowout in 2022 caused by pandemic-driven spending among consumers and enterprise customers on computers and smartphones, with revenue falling from $40.1 billion in 2022 to $29.3 billion in 2023.\nBut sales have begun to normalize, with Apple reporting Mac revenue of $22.2 billion over the first nine months of the fiscal year versus $21.7 billion during the same period last year. In Q3, Mac revenue totaled $7 billion, up from $6.8 billion last year.\nApple's latest Mac mini gets the company's M4 chip along with its new M4 Pro processor just ahead of the holiday shopping season. (Image: Apple) \u00b7 Apple\nPC shipments more broadly are steadily recovering after two years of declines following the jump in growth at the onset of the pandemic. According to Gartner, shipments of Apple\u2019s Macs grew 3.5% in the third quarter from 5.4 million last year to 5.6 million this year.\nApple\u2019s pint-sized desktop features a bevy of connections and ports, making it more useful for consumers and enterprise users who need to hook up various peripherals including expanded storage and tools for photo editing. That includes an ethernet jack, HDMI port, and three USB-C Thunderbolt slots in the rear of the mini and two USB-C ports up front, along with a headphone jack.\nInside, Apple has outfitted the base Mac mini with its M4 chip and 16GB of memory, up from the M2 processor and 8GB of memory found in the prior generation of minis. Apple says the M4-powered mini\u2019s central processing unit (CPU) is up 1.8x faster than the CPU found in the M1-powered model. The M4\u2019s graphics processing unit (GPU), meanwhile, is 2.2x faster than the M1 mini's GPU.\nThe rear of the new Mac mini features Thunderbolt, HDMI, and ethernet ports. (Image: Apple) \u00b7 Apple\nIn addition to the new Mac mini, Apple also revealed its M4 Pro chip. A more powerful version of the M4, Apple says the M4 Pro features a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, and 16-core neural engine and can be equipped with up to 64GB of memory. Apple says a Mac mini with the M4 Pro is twice as fast as a mini running the company\u2019s older M2 Pro chip.\nStory Continues\nApple is rolling out the M4 chips just as it launches its Apple Intelligence platform for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The software, which Apple will update with new features throughout the rest of 2024 and 2025, includes options like notification summaries, AI-powered writing tools, and photo editing capabilities.\nWhile Apple says M1-based Macs will be able to run Apple Intelligence, the speedier M4 chips and larger amount of base memory should help on-device AI applications run faster, especially when it comes to video and photo apps.\nI\u2019ve been using a beta version of Apple Intelligence for the past few weeks, and while I haven\u2019t found much opportunity to use the photo editing or writing tools, notification summaries have been a huge help in getting my deluge of texts, Slacks, and news updates under control.\nStill, Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t a must-have quite yet. That may happen when the company releases its next batch of Apple Intelligence features later this year, including ChatGPT integration with Siri and Apple\u2019s Visual Intelligence.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

In December, ChatGPT will be integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, allowing users to access its expertise without needing to jump between tools.\nApple Intelligence does all this while protecting users\u2019 privacy at every step. At its core is on-device processing, and for more complex tasks, Private Cloud Compute gives users access to Apple\u2019s even larger, server-based models and offers groundbreaking protections for personal information. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in \u2014 their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won\u2019t store requests. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI\u2019s data-use policies apply.\nThe First Carbon Neutral Mac\nThe new Mac mini is Apple\u2019s first carbon neutral Mac, marking a significant milestone toward Apple 2030, the company\u2019s goal to be carbon neutral across the entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade.\nMac mini is made with over 50 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Apple-designed printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. The electricity used to manufacture Mac mini is sourced from 100 percent renewable electricity. And, to address 100 percent of the electricity customers use to power Mac mini, Apple has invested in clean energy projects around the world. Apple has also prioritized lower-carbon modes of shipping, like ocean freight, to further reduce emissions from transportation. Together, these actions have reduced the carbon footprint of Mac mini by over 80 percent.2 For the small amount of remaining emissions, Apple applies high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects, like those generated by its innovative Restore Fund.\nIn another first for Mac mini, the packaging is now entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal to remove plastic from its packaging by 2025.\nAn Unrivaled Experience with macOS Sequoia\nmacOS\u00ae Sequoia completes the new Mac mini experience with a host of exciting features, including iPhone\u00ae Mirroring, allowing users to wirelessly interact with their iPhone, its apps, and notifications directly from their Mac.7 Safari\u00ae, the world\u2019s fastest browser,8 now offers the Highlights feature, which quickly pulls up relevant information from a site; a smarter, redesigned Reader with a table of contents and high-level summary; and a new Video Viewer to watch videos without distractions. With Distraction Control, users can hide items on a webpage that they may find disruptive to their browsing. Gaming gets even more immersive with features like Personalized Spatial Audio and improvements to Game Mode, along with a breadth of exciting titles, including the upcoming Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows. Easier window tiling means users can stay organized with a window layout that works best for them. The all-new Passwords app gives convenient access to passwords, passkeys, and other credentials \u2014 all stored in one place. And users can apply new, beautiful built-in backgrounds for video calls, which include a variety of color gradients and system wallpapers, or upload their own photos.\nPricing and Availability\nCustomers can pre-order the new Mac mini with M4 and M4 Pro starting today, Tuesday, October 29, on apple.com/store and in the Apple Store\u00ae app in 28 countries and regions, including the U.S. It will start arriving to customers, and in Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Resellers, beginning Friday, November 8.\nMac mini with M4 starts at $599 (U.S.) and $499 (U.S.) for education.

          "whole_article": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos might not allow The Washington Post to run its traditional endorsement of a presidential candidate, but he\u2019s willing to pen and run an op-ed justifying his move. It\u2019s all in the name of keeping the media unbiased, Jeff Bezos insists.\nLast Friday, the Post announced it was not endorsing a candidate in the upcoming election, which has been deemed by some to be one of the closest in America\u2019s modern history. Sources said two Post writers produced an article that endorsed Kamala Harris, but the story was killed by Bezos, the outlet\u2019s billionaire owner.\nFacing backlash, Bezos is standing by his words. But Bezos\u2019 op-ed indicates this is a change of policy for future elections. On the topic of endorsements, he said \u201cending them is a principled decision, and it\u2019s the right one.\u201d He called his decision \u201ca meaningful step in the right direction\u201d when it comes to regaining the trust of readers amidst disillusionment with the sector in general.\nBezos defends himself, but admits some missteps\nCiting Gallup's data regarding slipping belief in institutions including the media, Bezos wrote \u201cour profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working.\u201d Despite being the owner of the Post since 2013, Bezos made his wealth and spent most of his career in the tech sector where he founded Amazon. Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n\u201cIt would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cComplaining is not a strategy.\u201d Going on to claim that \u201cpresidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\u201d Bezos said all they do is \u201ccreate a perception of bias.\u201d\nResearch from professors at Brown University shows that said endorsements are actually pretty influential \u201cin the sense that voters are more likely to support the recommended candidate after publication of the endorsement.\u201d But influence varies based on one\u2019s bias.\nEven Bezos admits the timing is a little off, as the election is only two weeks away from when the decision was announced. Calling the move \u201cinadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy,\u201d he insists there\u2019s \u201cno quid pro quo of any kind at work here.\u201d That\u2019s all despite Dave Limp, chief executive at Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin, meeting with Republican candidate Donald Trump the day of the announcement.\nBezos said he didn\u2019t know about the meeting beforehand, and implored people to trust him. Calling upon his track record at the Post, Bezos said his views are \u201cprincipled.\u201d\nStory Continues\nPerhaps this is not the job for a billionaire, concedes Bezos (though without any apparent desire to resign). \u201cWhen it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of The Post,\u201d he wrote, noting that officials at Amazon, Blue Origin, or other company he\u2019s invested in are often meeting with politicians. \u201cI once wrote that The Post is a \u2018complexifier\u2019 for me. It is, but it turns out I\u2019m also a complexifier for The Post.\u201d\nBacklash against Bezos amidst larger billionaire skepticism\nThe newspaper with the slogan \u201cdemocracy lies in darkness,\u201d has endorsed a candidate since 1976\u2014the only other time the Post declined to do so was in 1988, according to NPR. The choice to stay on the sidelines was met with some swift backlash from both internal and external figures.\nEditor-at-large Robert Kagan resigned the same day as the announcement regarding the change in endorsements, telling CNN that the policy was \u201cobviously an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with Donald Trump in the anticipation of his possible victory,\u201d as \u201cTrump has threatened to go after Bezos\u2019 business.\u201d Three out ten people on the Post\u2019s editorial board also stepped down because of the decision, while other journalists and columnists also quit in response.\nAn op-ed signed by 21 Post columnists disavows the choice as a \u201cterrible mistake,\u201d adding it \u201crepresents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love.\u201d\nBezos\u2019 choice also caused a dent in readership: As of Monday, more than 200,000 people\u2014representing around 8% of the outlet\u2019s total subscriber base\u2014canceled their subscriptions to the Post, sources told NPR.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a colossal number,\u201d former Post executive editor Marcus Brauchli told NPR of the dip in subscribers, adding there\u2019s no way to know \u201cwhy the decision was made.:\nA likely crucial element to America\u2019s distrust of the media is their growing skepticism of the rich. As wealth inequality balloons, more than half of (59%) of Americans reportedly believe billionaires create a more unfair society per Harris Poll\u2019s released survey of more than 2,100 U.S. adults.\nWhile respondents have some regard for billionaire's influence over the economy, many want them out of certain spheres. One of them is the media, as 42% of Americans don\u2019t think billionaires should be able to purchase businesses in the media sector.\nAs one of the richest people in the world, Bezos\u2019 wealth isn\u2019t just the elephant in the room; it\u2019s basically the whole room. \u201cYou can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests,\u201d he wrote in his op-ed. It seems that some Americans see it as the latter.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Quote\nFactors to Note\nA strong cloud services portfolio and expanding generative AI capabilities are expected to have aided the performance of AWS in the third quarter.\n\nIn the quarter under review, AWS announced the general availability of its new managed service called AWS Parallel Computing Service, which enables customers to build scientific and engineering models and seamlessly manage high-performance computing infrastructure.\n\nAmazon launched AWS GenAI Lofts, collaborative spaces and immersive experiences for startups and developers, offering key AI hotspots, workshops and hands-on programming from AI experts, community groups and AWS partners.\n\nAmazon introduced AWS App Studio, a generative AI-powered service that uses natural language to create enterprise-grade applications. The service allows technical professionals without software development skills to quickly build secure, fully managed applications, thereby reducing operational expertise and allowing them to focus on business problem-solving.\n\nOn the back of portfolio strength, AWS is likely to have witnessed solid customer momentum in the third quarter. AWS teamed up with Digital Domain to scale the latter's Autonomous Virtual Human Technology and help in introducing Generative AI-powered features.\n\nAWS was selected by the Central Japan Railway Company. The latter is using AWS' Internet of Things, machine learning (ML) and GenAI capabilities to drive efficient operations for its next-generation, high-speed train service.\n\nAWS was picked by Gold Fields GFI. The latter shifted its end-to-end SAP and treasury systems to AWS. Gold Fields is also leveraging AWS\u2019 analytics, ML and GenAI solutions to modernize technology infrastructure.\n\nAmazon partnered with GE HealthCare GEHC to allow the latter to use its healthcare and generative AI services to help clinicians improve medical diagnostics and patient care.\n\nAWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock.

The firm's revenue estimates are 6% and 8% ahead of the consensus for those years, respectively.\nThe anticipated integration with Netflix and Roku is expected to contribute approximately 400 basis points to The Trade Desk's gross spend growth in 2025, positioning the company's revenues ahead of consensus.\nThe firm also notes that The Trade Desk is likely to continue gaining market share from Google's DV360 in the medium term due to Alphabet's legal challenges.\n\u201cIn our view, the biggest benefit from ad-tech legal challenges at Alphabet/Google is likely to be underinvestment&lack of focus, rather than pot'l business model or industry structure changes,\u201d analysts continued.\nSeparately, Citi analysts said they expect \u201canother strong beat and raise quarter\u201d from TTD, noting that key growth drivers including CTV, Retail Media, and market share gains remain intact.

          "whole_article": "Amazon has four fewer Airbus package freighters for peak season than planned because the company responsible for converting the planes from passenger to cargo configuration is behind schedule and temporarily shifting production out of the United States until it can build a qualified workforce and supplier base. That has prompted charges of mismanagement from the lessor providing the aircraft.\nElbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW), a joint venture between aircraft manufacturer Airbus and Singapore Technologies Engineering, promised to deliver 10 rebuilt Airbus A330-300 widebody jets by the fourth quarter for use by Amazon\u2019s private cargo airline. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has received six of the A330 cargo jets since September 2023 and placed them with Hawaiian Airlines to fly in its domestic air distribution network under a 10-year transportation services agreement.\nIn an interview earlier this year, EFW Chief Executive Jordi Boto acknowledged shortcomings with the production process at sites in San Antonio and Mobile, Alabama, which he attributed to subpar training and workforce shortages stemming from the lingering effects of aviation industry layoffs during the COVID crisis. He said the company planned to relocate freighter conversion work to facilities in Asia and Europe until training and recruiting could be brought up to standard.\nFinal work is being carried out on the remaining aircraft at both modification sites, and no more conversions will be carried out in San Antonio and Mobile in 2025, EFW spokeswoman Anke Lemke said in an email last week.\nAmazon is leasing the Airbus cargo jets from Seattle-based Altavair, which owns the aircraft and contracted with EFW to retrofit them for carrying shipping containers on the main deck.\nAltavair CEO Steve Rimmer said EFW\u2019s problems mostly resulted from a deliberate decision to prioritize ST Engineering\u2019s more lucrative airline maintenance and repair work at the U.S. production sites, not supply chain disruptions plaguing the entire aircraft manufacturing and conversion industry. ST Engineering\u2019s commercial aerospace unit is a global provider of maintenance, repair and overhaul services (MRO) for aircraft, engines and components.\nRimmer accused EFW of protecting a majority shareholder\u2019s interests over customers when it moved skilled labor from the Mobile conversion line to fill gaps at ST Engineering\u2019s next-door maintenance shop and Airbus\u2019 manufacturing plant for A220 and A320 family passenger jets as airline operations recovered and demand for aircraft increased.\n\u201cThey saw an opportunity as Airbus\u2019 production lines in Mobile started gearing up again to rent labor to Airbus. Conversion customers were clearly left behind in the dust. The skilled labor is there. They\u2019ve just chosen to allocate it to other higher-yielding things,\u201d Rimmer told FreightWaves in a phone interview.\nStory Continues\nHe characterized the Mobile operation as \u201can unmitigated disaster.\u201d\nAn EFW machinest works to remodel an Airbus passenger jet for dedicated cargo service. (Photo: EFW)\nMRO companies typically charge about $250 an hour for maintenance compared to $180 an hour for conversions. Tearing down and rebuilding an A330-300 for cargo service costs more than $20 million, not including additional maintenance, and takes about four months under normal conditions, experts say.\nST Engineering\u2019s facility in San Antonio does MRO work and cargo conversions of A321 narrowbody aircraft. EFW also has production lines at its headquarters in Dresden, Germany, and Singapore, as well as third-party sites in Istanbul and in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin, China.\nA representative with another EFW customer, who asked not to be identified so as not to jeopardize ongoing business ties, said the conversion process in Mobile \u201cwas a horrible experience\u201d that involved late deliveries, invoices that were 40% to 50% higher than initial estimates and poor communication.\nEFW\u2019s customer list includes AerCap (lessor), BBAM (lessor), Air China Cargo, Air Transport Services Group (U.S. freighter operator and lessor), DHL Aviation, CDB Aviation (lessor, part of China Development Bank), Turkey-based MNG Airlines, Qantas, and SmartLynx Airlines.\nEach A330 for Amazon has been delivered about six months late. Rimmer said the remaining aircraft should be delivered by the end of the first quarter.\nHow the delays have impacted Amazon is difficult to quantify. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment about the A330 deliveries. But Hawaiian Airlines has hired new pilots and maintenance technicians who can\u2019t generate revenue yet without a full complement of freighters. Aviation experts say airlines need at least six to eight cargo planes for optimal operating efficiency and spare capacity when repairs are conducted. Amazon likely would want to carefully coordinate routes operated by A330s and its Boeing 767 and 737 aircraft to minimize capacity mismatches and delays.\nLabor challenges\nDemand for all-cargo aircraft spiked during the pandemic when shipping activity surged and the grounding of most passenger flights eliminated some 50% of global air cargo capacity. Shippers experienced capacity shortages and high rates during the airline industry\u2019s slow recovery in 2021 and 2022. Leasing companies that lost revenues because passenger assets were grounded hurried to repurpose narrowbody aircraft as freighters and speculative investors entered the conversion market for the first time.\nModifying a passenger jet for dedicated cargo operations is a complex process in which the aircraft is stripped to the bones and retrofitted with a ruggedized interior, reinforced flooring and bulkheads to support heavy containers, a large cargo door, a cockpit barrier, and new wiring.\nThe global economic shutdown during the pandemic created massive dislocation up and down the supply chain, with factories at limited capacity, port congestion, vessels off schedule, overcrowded warehouses and empty store shelves. Most companies laid off workers during the crisis and then had trouble restaffing when business picked up.\nAmazon\u2019s first A330 freighter, operated by Hawaiian Airlines, gets a water cannon salute from the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky airport as it departs on its first commercial flight in early October 2023. (Photo: Amazon)\nThe aerospace industry has struggled to fully recover. Some suppliers went out of business. Aircraft manufacturers and repair facilities experienced huge delays for parts and raw materials through 2023 and let go of skilled employees they didn\u2019t think would be needed. Many workers left the industry for other jobs and never came back. Other industries, especially the defense industry after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, poached aircraft machinists with offers of better pay and work conditions.\nBoto said EFW\u2019s assembly facilities in San Antonio and Mobile were hard-hit by the shortage of trained technicians at the same time the workload was increasing. With work quality and production rates suffering, the decision was made to transfer conversions to EFW facilities in other parts of the world. The company intends to bring back conversions to the U.S. in three or four years once it revamps the entire production and labor process, including recruiting and training, and figures out how to create a strong work culture rooted in quality. The best way to attract and keep good technicians is to set up a training academy or work with technical schools, he said.\n\u201cYou have to invest in training. \u2026 Conversion is the highest level of complexity that an operator can have,\u201d because technicians must have the flexibility to deal with imperfections in a 15- or 20-year-old plane, such as corrosion, that a machinist doesn\u2019t encounter when building a plane from scratch, said Boto.\nEFW needs to do a better job of providing management support to partner facilities and monitoring their progress, he acknowledged.\n\u201cWe have to change the way we support the sites. [Before,] we were delivering them the job cards, the technical documentation and the conversion kits. Now we have to be much more on-site. We have to send work parties to fully train them and work alongside them in critical phases of the conversion. We learned that. So we are rediscovering, a little bit \u2013 the whole business, actually,\u201d said Boto.\nSending conversion work to Europe and Asia makes sense, because many current customers are in Asia and it allows ST Engineering to concentrate on its MRO business, the EFW chief explained. Also, production of the A321 has slowed as passenger airlines hold on to aircraft longer because Boeing, Airbus and engine makers are dealing with their own delays related to supply chain and quality issues, which means there is less feedstock of used aircraft to repurpose for cargo conversions.\nFrayed relationship\nEFW communicated openly with Altavair and other customers as soon as delays were obvious so they had time to find other aircraft to fill a need on a temporary basis, according to Boto. Fitting reallocated planes into a new repair facility requires extensive negotiations to persuade customers to either move up or move back reservation slots and ensure suppliers can deliver parts ahead of schedule, he said.\nAltavair negotiated with Airbus to buy four new A330-300 jets that were built for Hainan Airlines in China and never delivered, and bought the other six used aircraft from Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways.\nThe lessor selected EFW in 2022 to overhaul the Airbus A330s, because it was viewed as a subsidiary of the original equipment manufacturer and ST Engineering had a long track record as a reputable retrofit outfit. Rival Israel Aircraft Industries was new to A330 conversions and farming out some jobs to third-party installers. Relying on Airbus\u2019 conversion program had the advantage of full access to Airbus\u2019 original design data, fully integrated manuals and maintenance support that independent conversion shops don\u2019t have. EFW was best positioned to meet Amazon\u2019s requirement to have all 10 planes in service by the 2024 peak season, said Rimmer.\nFrom the outset, ST Engineering fell behind in supplying pieces of EFW conversion kits to the Mobile production line\nThe ST Engineering maintenance, repair and overhaul facility in San Antonio, Texas, includes a hangar for cargo conversions (right foreground). ST Engineering will suspend conversion work there by the end of the year. (Photo: ST Engineering)\n\u201cAs a shareholder in EFW, you should be looking and saying, what\u2019s the impact of these actions on my clients? And that didn\u2019t happen. They just stepped back and claimed that they couldn\u2019t influence things,\u201d Altavair\u2019s CEO said.\nEFW\u2019s problems appear to be limited to U.S. facilities. Rimmer said one of its aircraft was inducted at a Chinese installation site that had never done an A330 conversion before and was finished ahead of schedule.\n\u201cIt demonstrates that if you\u2019re committed you can get it done. Conversions at sites in China have been markedly different and significantly better managed. The results are very evident.

          "whole_article": "Microsoft (MSFT) is at the forefront of the AI arms race, boasting an exceptional business model that consistently generates substantial and growing free cash flow. With the company\u2019s current valuation appearing fair, now may be an opportune time to buy its shares. I have a 12-month price target of $482.40, while the average Wall Street price target is $503.27. Therefore, I am decidedly bullish on MSFT stock, both in the short and long term.\nMicrosoft Should Not Be Underestimated in AI\nI am particularly bullish on Microsoft because it is widely recognized as a global leader in AI. Based on my analysis, Microsoft is likely at the forefront of the AI market, as demonstrated by its $10 billion commitment to ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This investment has enabled groundbreaking products like\u00a0Microsoft Copilot,\u00a0which integrates AI into its Office suite to improve productivity for millions of users. Notably, ChatGPT reached one million users in less than five days and 100 million users in about two months\u2014a feat of unprecedented growth.\nFurthermore, Microsoft, alongside partners like BlackRock (BLK), is involved in the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, which aims to raise up to $100 billion to develop data centers and energy infrastructure supporting AI operations. This partnership aligns with Microsoft\u2019s long-term strategy to lead the global AI industry. In the medium term, investors can anticipate growth driven by AI integrated into Microsoft\u2019s cloud services (Azure).\nHowever, the industry is crowded with Big Tech competitors, including Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and the unexpected outperformer Meta (META). Among these, I consider Meta to pose the most significant competitive threat to Microsoft, as it has open-sourced its frontier AI models, enabling third parties to iterate on the source code and advance the technology more rapidly\u2014a strategy Microsoft has not adopted.\nMSFT Stock Is Attractive for Growth Investors\nOne of the primary reasons I view Microsoft as an outstanding long-term investment is its robust history of generating substantial free cash flow. At the time of this writing, the company\u2019s free cash flow margin exceeds 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last trailing 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments.\nWhile Microsoft may not appear as a value investment, it is reasonably priced, in my view, given its consistent revenue and earnings growth, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. I estimate a 13% normalized EPS growth over the next 12 months. Based on this forecast, I hold a price target of $482.40, estimating the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of approximately 36.\nStory Continues\nLooking further ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next five to 10 years. While this outlook requires purchasing the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price presents an opportunity. The company\u2019s forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only a 6.5% premium over its five-year average, while its forward diluted EPS growth rate has expanded by nearly the same amount, at 5.8%.\nMSFT Faces Potential Headwinds in the Long Term\nOne potential challenge to Microsoft\u2019s long-term growth in AI is that its adoption may be cyclical. Currently, demand for AI systems is high, prompting Microsoft and other Big Tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks\u2014potentially due to macroeconomic constraints\u2014a slowdown in growth is likely.\u00a0According to the TipRanks Risk Analysis tool, Microsoft faces 32% of its risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is above the sector average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny on data privacy and AI governance.\nGiven this outlook, I anticipate some volatility in Microsoft\u2019s growth trajectory over the long term, though it may be less pronounced than that of semiconductor companies like NVIDIA (NVDA). Periodic price and valuation dips coinciding with temporarily lower growth rates could provide more attractive buying opportunities as sentiment fluctuates.\nThere is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure.\u00a0With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft\u2019s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations.\u00a0This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.\nIs Microsoft a Buy, Hold or Sell?\nOn Wall Street, Microsoft receives a broadly positive outlook, with 26 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and no Sell ratings. The average MSFT price target is $503.27, reflecting a 17.5% upside potential over the next 12 months.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nThis positive sentiment reinforces the view that now may be a prudent time to invest in Microsoft, given its strong market position and leadership in AI.\nKey Takeaway: Microsoft Is a Leading AI Investment\nI am bullish on Microsoft due to its leadership in AI, supported by its significant stake in OpenAI. Additionally, the company has demonstrated consistent free cash flow growth, which is likely to strengthen its market leadership over the long term. Although Meta is a strong competitor in the AI landscape, I remain confident that Microsoft holds the leading position. Based on my analysis, MSFT stock is a Buy.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

Last week, the Tesla stock jumped about 23% primarily due to margin improvement and an upbeat outlook (read: Tesla Records its Best Day in 11 Years: 5 ETF Winners).\nDespite this surge, Wall Street remains divided over Tesla's place in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d \u2014 a group of market-dominating tech giants, including NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Microsoft MSFT and Tesla (read: Is Tesla's Stock Pop Sustainable? TSLA ETFs in Focus).\nAs the third-quarter earnings season kicks off, the Magnificent Seven is anticipated to record 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth, with NVIDIA, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta among the top contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, per FactSet, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nTesla\u2019s Earnings Rebound Yet Leave Analysts Skeptical\nTesla\u2019s third-quarter profits showed a 17% jump, a meaningful rebound after two quarters of decline. However, analysts remain cautious about Tesla\u2019s long-term position among Big Tech, citing concerns that its fundamentals may be overhyped.\nWe would like to note that Tesla\u2019s delivery numbers fell short of estimates in the past. Tesla has been losing market share to its rivals in both China and the United States, resulting in a notable slowdown in growth. This month itself we have seen Tesla\u2019s unimpressive robotaxi event, which failed to meet expectations, raising concerns among ridesharing investors.\nValuation Concerns Add to Tesla\u2019s Strained Standing\nTesla\u2019s pricey valuation further complicates its status within the Magnificent Seven. Although higher growth tends to demand a higher valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 115.54, Tesla\u2019s valuation far exceeds its tech peers.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalyst sentiment reflects this caution. Tesla currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.96 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 2.89 a month ago based on 38 recommendations.\nOf the 39 recommendations deriving the current ABR, Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 23.08% and 5.13%. It is the lowest approval rate within the Magnificent Seven.\nTesla\u2019s Stock Price Target\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 35 analysts, the average price target for Tesla comes to $206.22. The forecasts range from a low of $24.86 to a high of $310.00. The average price target represents a decline of 23.4% from the last closing price of $269.19 as on Oct. 25.\nStory Continues\nCould Netflix be a More Suitable Candidate?\nAs Tesla\u2019s standing falters, streaming giant Netflix NFLX has emerged as a possible replacement, thanks to its strong earnings, subscriber growth, improving free cash flow and solid guidance. Year to date, Netflix stock has surged by 55%, trailing only NVIDIA and Meta among the Magnificent Seven.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWealth Enhancement Group\u2019s Ayako Yoshioka believes Netflix is an appealing alternative due to its strong earnings and solid guidance. Bank of America loves its free cash flow strength, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Same is the view of Portfolio Wealth Advisors\u2019 Jesus Alvarado-Martinez.\nWith free cash flow reaching $2.19 billion in Q3, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier, Netflix\u2019s cash flow has been rising steadily since the pandemic. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich projects Netflix\u2019s free cash flow to hit $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nBroker Rating on Netflix Stock\nOf the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR of Netflix shares, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.5% and 5% of all recommendations. The Netflix stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has an upbeat VGM Score of B. Netflix shares trade at a forward P/E of 37.88X versus 105.6X forward P/E possessed by the underlying Broadcast Radio and Television.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNetflix-Heavy ETFs in Focus\nInvestors who believe that Netflix shares deserve a spot in the tech elite club may play the stock in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) form, too.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks to buy before they split next.\nS&P 500: Targeting 6,000 Amid Market Optimism\nThere\u2019s been a notable sense of fear among investors despite the market\u2019s current strong performance. The upcoming weeks are expected to be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and an impending election, alongside uncertainty regarding the Fed\u2019s next moves. But the fact remains that the market has shown resilience, with numerous new highs for major indices this year, although investors remain skeptical. Historically, volatility tends to increase after elections as political changes take effect. Currently, volatility is relatively low but is anticipated to rise as January approaches and clarity about potential policy impacts emerges.\nDespite prevailing uncertainties, there remains cautious optimism about the market\u2019s ability to maintain its upward trajectory. In mid-October, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC to the skepticism displayed by investors. We covered his sentiment in our article about the\u00a08 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now:\n\u201cKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents\u2019 experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nAround the same time, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss the market trends as well. On October 14, Mary Ann Bartels highlighted that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, she acknowledged that while this target is achievable, the journey may not be smooth.\nStory Continues\nBartels noted that there could be volatility ahead, as evidenced by increased hedging activity in the market. However, she remains optimistic due to the Fed\u2019s shift towards an easier monetary policy and the ongoing economic growth, which is supported by full employment, albeit with a slight slowdown in job creation. Importantly, she highlighted that corporate profits are on the rise, with earnings currently beating expectations by about 5%. This positive trend across fundamental and technical indicators leads her to believe that the market can continue its rally into November and December.\nAs the S&P 500 recently closed above 5,800 for the first time at 5,815, Bartels discussed how this milestone brings the 6,000 target closer. She echoed sentiments from Tom Lee, who suggested that market behavior could improve significantly if there is clarity regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Bartels agreed that once a winner is declared, it could trigger a relief rally as both domestic and foreign investors gain confidence in the stability of US leadership.\nTurning to the Fed\u2019s actions, Bartels addressed concerns about recent CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected. She described potential short-term volatility as a bucking bull, indicating that while fluctuations might occur, the overall trend remains upward. Her year-ahead thesis suggests both fixed-income and equity markets are poised for positive returns, albeit with some bumps along the way.\nBartels also advocated for buying opportunities in the current market environment. She specifically pointed to technology stocks and the NASDAQ, which has yet to hit a new record high. She believes technology will continue to lead the market, particularly emphasizing semiconductors as key drivers of growth. For investors looking to enter the tech sector, she sees this as an opportune moment.\nHer perspective underscores a belief in the resilience of corporate profits and economic fundamentals amid changing monetary policies and external uncertainties. At the same time, it should be noted that the optimistic outlook for the S&P 500 targeting 6,000 is significant for stock splits as it reflects positive market sentiment, encouraging companies to make their shares more accessible to retail investors. When share prices rise, splits can attract more buyers by lowering the price per share. However, it\u2019s important to note that a stock split does not change anything about a business\u2019s fundamentals. A poor company will stay a poor company post-split and a good company will stay a good company.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of stocks that are likely to split. We then selected the 20 stocks that have experienced the highest gains in their share prices over the past 5 years and have a history of spitting their stock. From that, we picked the top 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Netflix Inc. (NFLX) a Top Stock to Buy Before the Next Split?\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nShare Price as of October 18: $689.66\nSurge in Share Price in 5 Years: 150.51%\nStock Split Confirmed: no\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming service provider that offers TV shows, movies, documentaries, and original content. Founded in 1997 as a DVD rental service, it transitioned to a streaming platform in 2007. It has revolutionized the way people consume entertainment and is considered a pioneer in the streaming industry.\nThe company has introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier powered by AI in late 2022 to enhance user experience and deliver more effective ads. As a pioneer in online streaming, it\u2019s a top-performing stock. Its massive and growing subscriber base drives significant revenue growth. In 2023, it achieved record UK revenues, primarily due to increased subscriber numbers following its crackdown on password sharing.\nRevenue was up by 15.02% year-over-year in Q3 2024. Despite challenges in membership growth and ad monetization, it added over 5 million new subscribers and improved its operating margin to 29.6%. International markets drove subscriber growth, and the ad-supported tier saw a 35% quarter-on-quarter increase in memberships. The company\u2019s strategic shift towards advertising has solidified its position as a strong investment.\nManagement announced that the company\u2019s first-party ad server is launching in Canada this quarter and will expand to other markets in 2025. Partnerships with Trade Desk and Google Live are progressing well. There are plans for more ad formats, features, and measurement tools.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) projects a 14.7% increase in revenue year-over-year for Q4, with a target operating margin of 21.6%. Looking ahead to 2025, it anticipates annual revenue between $43 billion and $44 billion, driven by continued subscriber growth and higher average revenue per subscriber. The international expansion and ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences position it for continued growth.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFinally, we trimmed\u00a0Netflix, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:NFLX) mostly due to valuation but also as a source of funds to add to the new position in Shopify. As a reminder, we added to our position in August 2022 amid broad concerns about the company\u2019s ability to grow and monetize shared passwords. We expected Netflix to show progress in monetizing shared passwords, leading to robust free cash flow generation. This is now playing out and is appreciated by the market. Hence, given the balance of growth and valuation, we felt it was appropriate to reduce our exposure to a more normal weight.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 2nd on our list of stocks to buy before they split next. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NFLX, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The firm's revenue estimates are 6% and 8% ahead of the consensus for those years, respectively.\nThe anticipated integration with Netflix and Roku is expected to contribute approximately 400 basis points to The Trade Desk's gross spend growth in 2025, positioning the company's revenues ahead of consensus.\nThe firm also notes that The Trade Desk is likely to continue gaining market share from Google's DV360 in the medium term due to Alphabet's legal challenges.\n\u201cIn our view, the biggest benefit from ad-tech legal challenges at Alphabet/Google is likely to be underinvestment&lack of focus, rather than pot'l business model or industry structure changes,\u201d analysts continued.\nSeparately, Citi analysts said they expect \u201canother strong beat and raise quarter\u201d from TTD, noting that key growth drivers including CTV, Retail Media, and market share gains remain intact.

          "whole_article": "Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley remains cautious on Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), lowering its price target on the stock to $60 from $65 and maintaining an Underweight rating, as analysts believe recent investor optimism is premature.\nShares of Roku have surged about 35% since the company's Q2 2024 earnings report, driven by expectations of a stronger ad market and accelerating growth.\nHowever, Morgan Stanley warns that rising competition and structural risks pose challenges ahead.\nThe investment bank sees the recent outperformance as reflecting renewed confidence in revenue growth acceleration and operating leverage in 2H24 and 2025.\n\"We see that optimism as premature and see strong and rising competition as an underappreciated risk,\" the analysts added.\nRoku's platform segment, which generates revenue from advertising and distribution fees, faces increasing headwinds, according to Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts highlighted that competition in the connected TV (CTV) ad market from major players such as Prime Video, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Disney is intensifying.\n\"Prime Video and Netflix are likely to be more competitive in '25 than '24,\" they cautioned, which could pressure pricing and limit Roku's growth.\nRoku's third-party demand-side platform (DSP) integrations offer long-term potential, but Morgan Stanley believes the impact will remain muted due to similar strategies adopted by competitors.\nAdditionally, the firm warns of risks to Roku's subscription distribution revenue.\n\"Streamers [are] increasingly looking to avoid app store fees,\" they noted, referencing Disney's recent decision to discontinue sign-ups for Disney+ and Hulu via Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s platform.\n\"The recent outperformance in shares suggests success is starting to be priced in and we see rising risk Roku does not deliver on elevated growth expectations,\" the analysts concluded, cautioning that rising expectations could leave Roku vulnerable if the company underdelivers.\nRelated Articles\nRoku stock optimism 'premature' says Morgan Stanley, sees downside risks\nAmerican Tower misses quarterly revenue estimates on leasing slowdown\nS&P 500 counts on final 'Mag 7' push for best year this century: McGeever\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nNetflix (NFLX) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this internet video service a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Netflix is 25.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 64.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 17.5%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Netflix is 5.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.9%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 17.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 1.7%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Netflix have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.6% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNetflix has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Netflix is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to figures from Ofcom, 68pc of UK households reported using a streaming service in the first three months of 2024, up from 66pc in 2023.\nThe most popular services were Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, with Netflix remaining the most watched, averaging 21 minutes per person per day in 2023.\nHere, Telegraph Money takes a look at what each of the major TV streaming platforms offer, along with tips on how you can cut costs without sacrificing the films and TV shows you want to watch.\nNetflix\nNetflix, which began as a DVD postal service, launched its groundbreaking streaming service in 2007 and by 2010 it was available on most devices.\nIt now creates enormous amounts of original content, such as the shows Bridgerton, The Crown and Baby Reindeer, and films including Scoop and Academy Award winner All Quiet On The Western Front.\nPreviously the streaming service had a large library of older content, although this has been eroded by other content producers launching their own platforms.\nSubscription numbers dropped after its 2022 announcement that it would be cracking down on password sharing, but the platform also added a cheaper membership option \u2013 which comes with ad breaks. Its viewing figures have since recovered, and its latest count of paying viewers topped 282.7 million globally.\nUK customers now have to pay an extra \u00a34.99 per month on top of their existing subscription to share their account outside their home.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a34.99 for a standard account with adverts for two devices; \u00a310.99 for standard account for two devices (extra member slots outside your household can be added for \u00a34.99); \u00a315.99 for premium account for four devices (extra member slots can be added for \u00a34.99). All charges are monthly.\nCan you share your password? Not any more. Netflix wrote to users in May 2023 to inform them they could no longer share accounts with people outside of their household. However, those signed up for a standard or premium account can purchase extra member slots for people who don\u2019t live with them for \u00a34.99 a month.\nStory continues\nAmazon Prime\nThe Amazon Prime Video platform is just one part of the Prime subscription, which also offers services like Prime Reading and free delivery on qualifying Amazon orders. Like Netflix, it has a number of original films and TV shows, with big hitters including Clarkson\u2019s Farm, The Grand Tour and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\nAmazon also has the rights to show 20 matches of Premier League fixtures over the course of a season. Both rounds for this season have already been shown, and it will not have the rights from the 2025-26 season onwards.\nThe streaming service recently launched ads, meaning your content will be interrupted by regular adverts unless you pay an extra \u00a32.99 each month.\nCustomers can get a one-month free trial before the paid subscription kicks in, while students can get a free six-month trial.\nIf you don\u2019t want free delivery or any of the other Prime services, you can get a cheaper Prime Video subscription, which is just for the streaming service.\nNote that you can end up paying extra to rent or buy titles that aren\u2019t part of the free Prime viewing offer. Look out for the Amazon Prime banner, which indicates the free things you can watch, or check out the \u201cFree to me\u201d section. Some shows, such as Neighbours, are free with adverts on Amazon\u2019s Freevee service.\nIt is possible to link Amazon accounts with another adult in your household and up to two children in order to share Prime benefits, including Prime Video, meaning only one subscription per household is needed.\nAmazon has not announced a password crackdown, so even if you don\u2019t link accounts, you should be able to share the Prime Video benefits with friends and family.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a35.99 per month for Prime Video only; \u00a38.99 per month or \u00a395 per year (\u00a312.88 cheaper); for students it\u2019s \u00a34.49 per month or \u00a347.49 per year (\u00a36.39 cheaper). It costs \u00a32.99 extra each month to watch ad-free.\nCan you share your password? You can share your Prime membership with someone else in your household, meaning you can both also get perks like free deliveries. There\u2019s no mechanism in place to strictly prohibit password sharing with other people, but be aware they may be able to access the rest of your Amazon account.\nDisney+\nWith more than 153 million subscribers as of August 2024, Disney+ has caused a real stir in the streaming market since it launched in the UK in March 2020.\nOriginally designed to be the home of all much-loved children\u2019s Disney content, the platform has expanded with its Star Wars and Marvel content. It also hosts a number of series popular with adults, such as Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Modern Family and exclusive content such as Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals.\nIts popularity with older generations has increased, with subscribers aged over-64 rising from 7pc in 2022 to 12pc in 2023, according to Ofcom.\nUsers can access Disney\u2019s entire back catalogue from its 80-year history, and the service also has exclusive streaming of new Disney films \u2013 though if you want these new films early it can cost around \u00a319.99 extra, on top of your subscription.\nIn November 2023 Disney announced an ad-supported subscription plan for \u00a34.99.\nIt has also cracked down on password sharing, with the possibility of being blocked from the streaming service if it detects that the account is shared with people who don\u2019t live at the primary residence.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a34.99 per month for a standard account with adverts for two devices; \u00a38.99 a month or \u00a389.90 a year (\u00a317.98 cheaper) for a standard account for two devices; \u00a312.99 per month or \u00a3129.90 per year (\u00a325.98 cheaper) for a premium account for four devices. Since it cracked down on password sharing, you can add an extra member, not in your household, for \u00a33.99 per month with ads, or \u00a34.99 per month without ads.\nCan you share your password? As of September 2024 you can no longer share a Disney+ account with someone outside of your household. Its customer support defines a household as \u201cthe collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside therein.\u201d\nIf you want to share your account outside of your household, you have to pay \u00a33.99 per month to add an extra member, or \u00a34.99 per month for ad-free viewing.\nNOW TV\nLaunched in 2012, NOW is Sky\u2019s on-demand streaming service, and is the place to go for many blockbusters and fan-favourite shows such as Game Of Thrones and Succession.\nArguably the most customisable service out there, you can get \u201cpasses\u201d for the specific kinds of things you want to watch \u2013 the Entertainment Pass covers Sky TV series and box sets, as well as children\u2019s shows, and a Sport Pass lets you watch everything on Sky Sports, while a Hayu Pass allows you watch reality TV shows such as Real Housewives and Below Deck at the same time it\u2019s released in America, putting an end to spoilers.\nIn addition, you can choose how long you want to sign up for. Most passes come with a rolling monthly option, but the Sports Pass, for example, has a day pass option where you spend \u00a314.99 for 24-hour access to 12 live Sky Sports channels \u2013 ideal if there\u2019s just one particular match you want to watch.\nHowever, it can get expensive if you want access to all of the channels.\nWith the standard subscription for an Entertainment or Cinema Pass you can only stream on one device at a time, and will have to watch ads. You can add on a Boost subscription for \u00a36 per month to watch on two devices and watch ad-free, or Ultra Boost for \u00a39 which allows three devices and ad-free viewing.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a39.99 a month for Entertainment Pass or Cinema Pass; \u00a334.99 a month for Sport Pass; \u00a34.99 a month for Hayu Pass (for reality TV).\nCan you share your password? There\u2019s nothing strictly prohibiting password sharing, but you may come a cropper as only a limited number of streams can take place at the same time. To get three simultaneous streams, you need to sign up to the Boost service, which costs an extra \u00a39 a month after a seven-day free period.\nApple TV+\nWhile Apple TV+ was once one of the best value streaming services on the market, its \u00a36.99 monthly price has since risen to \u00a38.99, putting it broadly in-line with several other services.\nThe streaming service, which is free for three months to those who buy new Apple products, has however received criticism for its relatively small library, but the shows are Apple TV+ originals.\nAmong its big hitters are football-comedy-with-feelings Ted Lasso, and The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Anniston and Reese Witherspoon. Watching anything on Apple TV+ is ad-free.\nIn an Oscars upset, the streaming service became the first to win a Best Picture award for CODA, a heart-warming indie drama, beating offerings from the likes of Netflix.\nUp to five family members can be added to the subscription and the main account holder can stop others from making extra purchases via your Apple account \u2013 perfect for stopping small children overspending on your card.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a38.99 a month after a seven-day free trial.\nCan you share your password? You\u2019re encouraged to share your Apple TV+ account with up to five family members in your household. It\u2019s possible to share with people outside of your household, but you\u2019ll want to be extra careful about making sure the extra purchase option is turned off.\nParamount+\nLaunched in the UK in 2022, Paramount+ is vying to compete with the streaming mainstays of Amazon and Netflix.\nIt has a large catalogue of content \u2013 ranging from original shows, to programmes from channels like MTV and Comedy Central. It has also branched into Star Trek spin-off shows, and rebooted the US comedy Frasier.\nParamount\u2019s collection of films is also quite substantial, including 90s classics Titanic and Clueless, as well as more recent releases such as the Mean Girls musical.\nHow much does it cost? \u00a36.99 a month, or \u00a369.90 a year. It comes with a seven-day free trial. Sky Cinema subscribers can use the streaming service for free.\nCan you share your password?\u00a0Six profiles can be created with your account, so theoretically, you can share your account with five other people. Only two devices can be in use at once, so two people can watch Paramount+ at the same time from the same account.\nFree options and other ways to save\nIf you want to maintain access to the various streaming services, there are a few ways you can cut your costs.\nConsider rotating your subscriptions\nIf you\u2019re paying monthly, it can make sense to pause or cancel your account whenever you\u2019re not using it. For example, if you\u2019re signed up to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, you could pause two accounts while you focus on watching things on Netflix, the next month pause Netflix and focus on Disney+, and so on.\nShare whenever you can\nEven if you can\u2019t share your passwords \u2013 or don\u2019t want to \u2013 at least make sure there aren\u2019t multiple accounts being paid for within your household. Each service usually comes with more than enough available profiles for everyone to maintain their own list of things they\u2019re watching, and recommendations for further viewing. It\u2019s also possible to add parental controls to children\u2019s profiles, ensuring they can only view age-appropriate content.\nUse free trials\nMost streaming services offer free trials, of varying lengths. Getting three months of free Apple TV+, for example, is more than enough time to get through a couple of its best series \u2013 after which time you can simply cancel your subscription.\nCheck for bundles\nIn some cases, you can get a streaming service thrown in with certain mobile phone bundles \u2013 so make sure you\u2019re not paying for something you could be getting for free.\nFor example, Vodafone phone and SIM only customers can get its entertainment plan, which includes membership to YouTube Premium or Amazon Prime. Some Sky packages also come with Netflix thrown in; currently, you can get Sky Stream with Netflix (standard with ads) for \u00a328 per month for 24 months.\nOpt for free streaming\nWhile you will need a TV licence to watch BBC iPlayer and any live shows on other catch-up services, viewers can stream ITV X, My 5, and Channel 4 for free.\nAlternatively, Internet Archive, a free digital library, offers a large collection of films that are in the public domain \u2013 but don\u2019t expect to find the latest blockbusters. Top Documentary Films is a site perfect for when you want to learn something, offering thousands of insightful documentaries."

OpenAI has been planning a custom chip and working on such uses for the technology for around a year, the people said, but the discussions are still at an early stage.\nOpenAI declined to comment. Representatives for Broadcom and TSMC did not respond. Reuters reported on OpenAI\u2019s ongoing talks with Broadcom and TSMC on Tuesday. The Information reported in June that Broadcom had discussed making an AI chip for OpenAI.\nThe process for taking a chip from design to production is long and expensive. OpenAI is less focused on graphics processing units, chips that are used to train and build generative AI models \u2014 a market that has been cornered by Nvidia Corp. Instead, it\u2019s looking for a specialized chip that will run the software and respond to user requests, a process called inference. Investors and analysts expect the need for chips to support inference will only grow as more tech companies use AI models to field more complex tasks.\nOpenAI may continue to research setting up its own network of foundries, or chip factories, one of the people said, but the startup has realized that working with partners on custom chips is a quicker, attainable path for now. Reuters earlier reported that OpenAI was pulling back from the effort of establishing its own chip manufacturing capacity.\nBroadcom shares closed up 4.2% to $179.24 in New York trading on Tuesday. Even before the latest gain, they were up 54% this year. TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares closed more than 1% higher.\nBroadcom is the largest designer of application-specific integrated circuits \u2014 chips designed to fit a single purpose specified by the customer. The company\u2019s biggest customer in this area is Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Broadcom also works with Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\nWhen asked last month whether he has new customers for the business, given the huge demand for AI training, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that he will only add to his short list of customers when projects hit volume shipments.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy product to deploy for any customer, and so we do not consider proof of concepts as production volume,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call.\nOpenAI\u2019s services require massive amounts of computing power to develop and run \u2014 with much of that coming from Nvidia chips. To meet the demand, the industry has been scrambling to find alternatives to Nvidia. That\u2019s included embracing processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and developing in-house versions.\nOpenAI is also actively planning investments and partnerships in data centers, the eventual home for such AI chips. The startup\u2019s leadership has pitched the US government on the need for more massive data centers and CEO Sam Altman has sounded out global investors, including some in the Middle East, to finance the effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stretch,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told Bloomberg Television on Monday. \u201cStretch from a capital perspective but also my own learning.

The company is now generating billions of dollars from that type of product \u2014 a rapid rise from a year ago \u2014 but remains well short of the tens of billions of dollars that its rival is raking in.\nAMD shares fell about 4% in late trading Tuesday.

Massive spending by companies such as Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS and Microsoft Corp. on this still-new type of computing infrastructure has upended the industry.

          "whole_article": "By Max A. Cherney, Jeffrey Dastin, Dawn Chmielewski, Fanny Potkin and Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon. He soon made a big mistake.\nIntel had a sweet deal going with Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, the giant manufacturer of semiconductors for other companies. TSMC would make chips that Intel designed but could not produce. And it was offering deep discounts to Intel, say four people with knowledge of the agreement.\nInstead of nurturing the relationship, Gelsinger \u2013 who hopes to restore Intel\u2019s own manufacturing prowess \u2013 offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan\u2019s precarious relations with China. \u201cYou don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab,\u201d he said in May 2021, using industry jargon for a chip fabrication plant. That December, encouraging U.S. investment in U.S. chipmakers, he said at a tech conference: \u201cTaiwan is not a stable place.\u201d\nIn public, TSMC downplayed the comments, with its founder calling Gelsinger \u201ca bit rude.\u201d Privately, TSMC said it would no longer honor the discount, the sources said: about 40% off the $23,000, 3-nanometer wafers on which TSMC would print chips for Intel. Intel had to pay full price, shrinking its profit margin on the deal.\nAsked about the previously unreported episode, Intel said TSMC is an important partner with which it has a \u201chealthy business relationship today.\u201d TSMC told Reuters Intel is an important customer.\nGelsinger\u2019s affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps during his time as Intel CEO. He inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. But Gelsinger compounded those problems.\nThis account of his rocky tenure is based on interviews with about four dozen current and former Intel employees and executives, as well as internal company videos, supplier documents and regulatory records.\nGelsinger set sky-high expectations for Intel\u2019s manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or canceling contracts or unable to deliver the promised products. He issued optimistic public projections for AI-chip deals that were far higher than Intel\u2019s own internal sales forecasts, company insiders say.\nAnd like TSMC, Gelsinger sought to transform Intel into a \"foundry,\" an operation that makes chips designed by other companies. But Intel\u2019s efforts to regain manufacturing leadership with a chip-production process called 18A have faced delays and technical problems, with some customers so far declining to use it.\nStory continues\nIntel declined to make Gelsinger available for an interview.\n\u201cPat is leading one of the largest, boldest and most consequential corporate turnarounds in American business history,\u201d Intel said in a statement. \u201c3.5 years into the journey, we have made immense progress \u2013 and we\u2019re going to finish the job.\u201d\nIntel\u2019s revenue shriveled to $54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from the year Gelsinger took over. Analysts expect Intel to lose $3.68 billion this year, its first annual net loss since 1986. Its shares closed at $22.92 on Monday, off 66% from a peak hit in Gelsinger\u2019s first months as CEO.\nThe crash in Intel\u2019s share price has sparked takeover interest, Reuters has reported. Intel has vowed to restructure and to cut more than 15,000 jobs.\nIntel said it won\u2019t let merger speculation distract it from executing its five-year turnaround plan. Under Gelsinger, Intel said, it has revamped its operations, secured up to $45 billion in U.S. support, led the market for AI PC chips, and \u201cachieved a historic pace\u201d of innovation.\nIntel told Reuters its 18A fabrication technologies are yielding good-quality chips and that it \u201cexpects to return to process leadership in 2025\u201d with their formal launch. The company said it objects to the \u201cusage of rumors, leaked materials, half-truths and interviews based on the widest net that can be cast for \u2018sources\u2019 to gain negative commentary on Intel.\u201d\nCustomers have little incentive to bet on Intel\u2019s manufacturing when TSMC continues to serve them well, said Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. \u201cIf you care about performance today, tomorrow, next year, over the next couple of years, you are not making that bet,\u201d Hari said.\nStill, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in September U.S. manufacturing represents a supply-chain \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that major chip designers would pay for. \u201cThey should want U.S.-made leading-edge chips,\u201d she said.\nIntel\u2019s stumbles have implications for U.S. industrial policy. Gelsinger\u2019s vow to create a foundry raised hopes in the Biden Administration that Intel would help bring chip production back under U.S. control on U.S. soil.\nA White House spokesperson said that a bill championed by President Joe Biden, the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to invest in not one but dozens of companies strengthening the semiconductor supply chain. Intel has won more than $11 billion in proposed funding under the act.\nGelsinger\u2019s journey at Intel started in 1979 when he was 18. He stayed for 30 years, coming under the tutelage of Andy Grove, Intel\u2019s legendarily demanding former CEO, which Gelsinger likened to \u201cgoing to the dentist and not getting Novocaine.\u201d Gelsinger became Intel\u2019s first chief technology officer but left in 2009 around a restructuring.\nIntel changed while he was away. Its so-called \u201cGrovian\u201d culture of constructive confrontation \u2013 one that encouraged peers to challenge each other with data \u2013 faded away. Intel also missed huge market opportunities. It stuck to its strengths, chips for desktop computers and servers. But it passed on a chance to produce semiconductors for the iPhone and declined to fund breakthrough artificial-intelligence company OpenAI.\nHis return in February 2021 gave a boost to Intel. Investors cheered his appointment, sending shares up nearly 7% on the day of the January announcement. Employees said they celebrated having a technologist back in charge.\nIntel, in Gelsinger\u2019s view, needed to execute at a \u201ctorrid\u201d pace. He at times wore a black T-shirt, available to buy at Intel\u2019s company store, with the word \u201ctorrid\u201d emblazoned on it. The energetic CEO did push-ups and jumping jacks before speaking at Intel events, a witness said.\nThe bet on which Gelsinger staked Intel\u2019s future came less than two months into his tenure: a global foundry that could vie with TSMC. In March 2021, he promised to invest $20 billion in two Arizona factories. That July, he said Intel also would develop five manufacturing processes in four years. Among them was 18A, a bundle of technologies under development that he hoped would restore Intel\u2019s manufacturing excellence.\nGelsinger pushed for Congress to subsidize American chip manufacturing. In January 2022, he stood with Biden to announce another $20 billion for two factories in Ohio. Gelsinger told Reuters at the time that Intel\u2019s commitment in the state might reach $100 billion to create \u201cthe largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet.\u201d\n\u2018FIVE REASONS TO BELIEVE\u2019\nChip sales boomed in the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumers gobbled up tech gadgets. By the spring of 2022, with product prices spiking and workers returning to offices, a glut emerged. Intel\u2019s revenue from personal computer chips dropped 25% in the second quarter of 2022. And it lost market share for chip sales in data centers to Advanced Micro Devices, while companies such as Amazon.com and Google increasingly designed silicon in-house.\nGelsinger called on staff to keep the faith. In regular video dispatches, he set out \u201cfive reasons to believe\u201d in Intel, say four people who saw them. In an early video, seen by Reuters, he urged employees to \u201cbelieve deeply in your heart and soul Intel\u2019s best days are ahead.\u201d\nIntel said Gelsinger \u201cconsistently balanced his optimism with a clear-eyed view of the challenges inherent in getting there.\u201d\nGelsinger was optimistic with clients, too. He oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet\u2019s growing fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis, set to roll out across the U.S., three people familiar with the previously unreported plans told Reuters. Gelsinger personally discussed the deal with Sundar Pichai, Alphabet\u2019s CEO, two of the people said.\nBut after Intel\u2019s outlook worsened in 2022, the company canceled the Waymo deal, the two people said, and paid a fee to Alphabet after Alphabet threatened legal action.\nSandra Rivera, who formerly ran Intel\u2019s data center group and is now CEO of Intel-owned Altera, said in an interview that her team cut the Waymo project after a corporate reorganization required her to make \u201cdecisions about the entire portfolio.\u201d\nIntel said it has a strong partnership with Alphabet and declined to discuss the project. Alphabet declined to comment on the matter.\nGelsinger announced cost cuts in October 2022 to bolster Intel while he continued to pour money into factories. The company said it would save $3 billion starting the following year from steps such as business exits and layoffs.\nUnder his watch, Intel\u2019s headcount had risen to some 132,000 employees by the end of 2022 from about 111,000 when he joined. In its statement, Intel said the \u201cunprecedented pace\u201d at which it developed technology and capacity necessitated such hiring.\nCHATGPT MOMENT\nNvidia\u2019s graphics processing units, or GPUs, posed a new challenge in November 2022. That month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that could conjure human-like prose on command. It became history\u2019s fastest growing software application at the time. Nvidia\u2019s chips power the data centers behind ChatGPT.\nOriginally designed for videogames, researchers discovered years ago that GPUs are useful for AI applications. They could handle vast numbers of simultaneous calculations better than central processing units, or CPUs, from Intel.\nNvidia saw its stock triple in eight months, notching a $1 trillion valuation. Intel\u2019s stock saw choppy trading; it cut base pay for mid-level workers and restricted promotions and bonuses.\nGelsinger too would take a salary cut, Intel said. Still, his total compensation, including stock awards, rose to $16.9 million in 2023 from $11.6 million the year before, a proxy filing shows.\nAround this time, Gelsinger had high hopes for Intel\u2019s Gaudi chip, a so-called AI accelerator \u2013 a processor that improves the performance of artificial intelligence applications. Intel touted the chip \u2013 designed in-house and made by TSMC \u2013 as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s often scarce GPUs.\nTeams at Intel estimated it could sell at most $500 million in AI chips, three people familiar with the forecast said. In a meeting with executives in the second quarter of 2023, Gelsinger said this number was not high enough. Intel needed to tell Wall Street it could hit at least $1 billion at a time when Nvidia\u2019s comparable sales were far higher, one of the people cited Gelsinger as saying.\nGelsinger touted the $1 billion figure in public. On Intel\u2019s July 2023 earnings-results call, he told analysts of \u201csurging demand for AI products.\u201d He added: \u201cOur pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share.\u201d\nAccording to one of these sources and another person briefed on the matter, Intel at the time of Gelsinger's announcement had not secured anything near the supply needed from TSMC to sell $1 billion in AI-accelerator chips. After Gelsinger demanded the billion-dollar target, Intel tweaked its math to justify it, lumping in chips unrelated to its marquee AI offering, two sources said.\nIntel said Gelsinger\u2019s comments accurately reflected prospective deals, not sales. \u201cNo company converts 100% of its pipeline into revenue,\u201d Intel said. \u201cWe make no apologies for setting ambitious internal targets for our teams \u2013 and we will always try to exceed the goals we set for ourselves.\u201d\nAs recently as January of this year, Intel told investors it had more than $2 billion in possible AI chip deals in the pipeline. In April, Gelsinger revealed to analysts a much lower AI revenue goal for this year: more than $500 million.\nAt times, Gelsinger has told leaders at major clients that Intel could furnish alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, said three people familiar with the talks \u2013 including for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, two of them said. When customers sought details, Intel managers had little to show and some deals didn\u2019t happen, the sources said.\nMicrosoft declined to comment. Amazon referred Reuters to recent news about its work with Intel.\nIntel has struggled to pick an AI-chip strategy. It funded three projects simultaneously by 2019: a GPU of its own, and two other chips designed to perform AI calculations from a pair of companies it acquired. None of the three made significant inroads against Nvidia or AMD, Reuters has reported.\nOn Intel\u2019s GPU efforts, Rivera, the former data center chief, told Reuters: \u201cIt\u2019s a journey, and everything looks simpler from the outside.\u201d\nIntel said the strategy anticipates how businesses will want to run AI more cheaply and how it alone can serve AI chip-design and manufacturing needs.\nMANUFACTURING WOES\nGelsinger kept pushing ahead despite setbacks, with Intel trumpeting factory expansions that would cost more than $60 billion. Then, this summer, he hit the brakes on some of these construction plans.\nIntel\u2019s ambitious new process for making chips for other firms \u2013 18A \u2013 also remains a question mark.\nSome customers have been disappointed by what they\u2019ve seen of 18A.\nWhen one big prospect, chip and software company Broadcom, sent foot-wide wafers through Intel\u2019s 18A process, the process was not ready for high-volume production for external customers, Reuters reported in September. No more than 20% of the chips printed via 18A passed Broadcom's early tests, two people briefed on the results said. That is low compared to TSMC\u2019s early-stage yields.\nBroadcom told Reuters it has \u201cnot concluded\u201d its evaluation of whether to use Intel\u2019s foundry.\nOn the day of the Reuters report in September, Intel issued a statement saying it was on track to launch 18A in 2025 and had released tools for partners and customers to plan chips for the process.\nA recent planning document produced by an Intel supplier indicates delays, however. The document, seen by Reuters, noted the supplier is still waiting to receive another digital design kit it needs to push ahead. It also lacked access to Intel factories, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Customers have little prospect of making chips in high volume with the 18A process until 2026, two people said.\nApple and Qualcomm, among other potential clients, have passed on 18A for technical reasons, three people with knowledge of their decisions said. Both companies declined to comment.\nIntel said it expects to reclaim leadership in chip-manufacturing processes in 2025 by launching 18A.\nGelsinger said in mid-September Intel had a \u201clot of work ahead,\u201d but he continues to project confidence in his turnaround plan.\n\u201cI'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,\u201d Gelsinger told Reuters in August. \u201cThree years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.\u201d\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin, Max Cherney and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, and Fanny Potkin in Singapore; additional reporting by Milana Vinn in New York and Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Claudia Parsons)"

However, this meteoric rise has raised questions about its valuation. Is the future already priced into the stock, or are there still significant upside opportunities?\nTo justify a $3.5 trillion valuation, Nvidia would need to deliver extraordinary growth and profitability over the next several years. Let's break down the math:\nFirst we have to take a look at NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s outlook for the current quarter. Here is what the company said:\n\u2022\u00a0Revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n\u2022\u00a0GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. For the full year, gross margins are expected to be in the mid-70% range.\nNvidia, Software\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\nNvidia\u2019s market cap is more or less $3.5 trillion. This means investors expect NVDA to earn around $180 billion per year once it becomes a more mature company like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) which is currently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 19. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s quarterly revenue and profits are probably around $33 billion and $18 billion respectively right now. Is it reasonable to assume that NVDA\u2019s quarterly profit can go from $18 billion today to $45 billion in a few years and then continue to grow at the same rate that GOOGL\u2019s quarterly profit is growing?\nIf NVDA manages to earn $180 billion in after-tax profits in a few years and then its profits continue to increase at around 10% annual rate, its market valuation will probably be around $3.5 trillion. That means NVDA investors will generate a total return of zero percent if NVDA satisfies the expectations embedded in its current stock price. For NVDA investors to generate a modest 10% annual return, NVDA needs to generate close to $250 billion in annual after tax profits by 2028.\nWhile we acknowledge NVDA's market dominance and potential as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "By Krystal Hu, Fanny Potkin and Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - OpenAI is working with Broadcom and TSMC to build its first in-house chip designed to support its artificial intelligence systems, while adding AMD chips alongside Nvidia chips to meet its surging infrastructure demands, sources told Reuters.\nOpenAI, the fast-growing company behind ChatGPT, has examined a range of options to diversify chip supply and reduce costs. OpenAI considered building everything in-house and raising capital for an expensive plan to build a network of factories known as \"foundries\" for chip manufacturing.\nThe company has dropped the ambitious foundry plans for now due to the costs and time needed to build a network, and plans instead to focus on in-house chip design efforts, according to sources, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss private matters.\nThe company's strategy, detailed here for the first time, highlights how the Silicon Valley startup is leveraging industry partnerships and a mix of internal and external approaches to secure chip supply and manage costs like larger rivals Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft. As one of the largest buyers of chips, OpenAI's decision to source from a diverse array of chipmakers while developing its customized chip could have broader tech sector implications.\nBroadcom stock jumped following the report, finishing Tuesday's trading up over 4.5%. AMD shares also extended their gains from the morning session, ending the day up 3.7%.\nOpenAI, AMD and TSMC declined to comment. Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOpenAI, which helped commercialize generative AI that produces human-like responses to queries, relies on substantial computing power to train and run its systems. As one of the largest purchasers of Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs), OpenAI uses AI chips both to train models where the AI learns from data and for inference, applying AI to make predictions or decisions based on new information.\nReuters previously reported on OpenAI's chip design endeavors. The Information reported on talks with Broadcom and others.\nOpenAI has been working for months with Broadcom to build its first AI chip focusing on inference, according to sources. Demand right now is greater for training chips, but analysts have predicted the need for inference chips could surpass them as more AI applications are deployed.\nBroadcom helps companies including Alphabet unit Google fine-tune chip designs for manufacturing and also supplies parts of the design that help move information on and off the chips quickly. This is important in AI systems where tens of thousands of chips are strung together to work in tandem.\nStory continues\nOpenAI is still determining whether to develop or acquire other elements for its chip design, and may engage additional partners, said two of the sources.\nThe company has assembled a chip team of about 20 people, led by top engineers who have previously built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) at Google, including Thomas Norrie and Richard Ho.\nSources said that through Broadcom, OpenAI has secured manufacturing capacity with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to make its first custom-designed chip in 2026. They said the timeline could change.\nCurrently, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs hold over 80% market share. But shortages and rising costs have led major customers like Microsoft, Meta, and now OpenAI, to explore in-house or external alternatives.\nOpenAI\u2019s planned use of AMD chips through Microsoft's Azure, first reported here, shows how AMD's new MI300X chips are trying to gain a slice of the market dominated by Nvidia. AMD has projected $4.5 billion in 2024 AI chip sales, following the chip's launch in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTraining AI models and operating services like ChatGPT are expensive. OpenAI has projected a $5 billion loss this year on $3.7 billion in revenue, according to sources. Compute costs, or expenses for hardware, electricity and cloud services needed to process large datasets and develop models, are the company's largest expense, prompting efforts to optimize utilization and diversify suppliers.\nOpenAI has been cautious about poaching talent from Nvidia because it wants to maintain a good rapport with the chip maker it remains committed to working with, especially for accessing its new generation of Blackwell chips, sources added.\nNvidia declined to comment.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York, Fanny Potkin in Singapore, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, additional reporting by Anna Tong and Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and David Gregorio)"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nTom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management Group, states that the two things to look for in the earnings season are consumer spending and companies' spending on technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Recent reports from the financial sector and retailers suggest that consumers are in good financial shape, setting the stage for a promising holiday season as well as providing a solid opportunity for growth in the fourth quarter. He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nSometimes, these AI-related names are a bit overvalued and there is volatility; but the long-term thesis remains strong. In fact, these \u201cdown days\u201d can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major \u201cAI arms race\u201d is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings.\nJust like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn\u2019t surprised by recent market developments. It\u2019s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is \u201ceasy to hope\u201d that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, \u201creaffirms that confidence\u201d.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents.\n\u201cWe think every company in the world, whether it\u2019s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.\u201d -Taylor told CNBC in an interview.\nIn other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo\u2019s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both.\n\"Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety.\" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company\u2019s Master Perfumer\nAdvancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI\u2019s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company:\n\u201cNeither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\u201d.\nWith that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (\nsee more details here\n).\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Unveils AI Workflow for Credit Card Fraud Detection, Enhancing Security for Financial Institutions\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nLeading the way in AI computing, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a darling AI stock. It is not only the leader in the AI chip market but has also built a robust AI ecosystem spanning graphics, computing, and networking solutions. Its GPUs are the backbone of AI innovation globally, powering everything from advanced data centers to autonomous systems.\nOn October 28, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed on its blog that they have developed a new NVIDIA workflow optimized for credit card transaction fraud. The new NVIDIA AI workflow for fraud detection that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses accelerated data processing and advanced algorithms to improve AI\u2019s ability to detect and prevent credit card transaction fraud.

          "whole_article": "Cisco (CSCO) is breaking out the AI thunder.\nOn Tuesday at its annual Partner Summit conference in Los Angeles, Cisco unveiled a new high-density GPU server for customers who want to train large language models. It also took the wraps off \"AI PODS,\" a product designed for clients keen on inferencing, the process artificial intelligence models use to derive conclusions from new data.\nCisco said both products are built to handle intensive AI workloads powered by Nvidia's (NVDA) accelerated computing.\n\"It's really an important event for us, and we've taken the opportunity here to start what is really a rolling thunder of announcements around AI infrastructure,\" Cisco chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins told Yahoo Finance.\nCisco Chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins speaks during a keynote address at Cisco Live! at Michelob ULTRA Arena on June 7, 2023, in Las Vegas, Nev. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images) \u00b7 Ethan Miller via Getty Images\nRobbins is aiming to keep the momentum going with Cisco's foray into AI.\nThe company has shipped $1 billion of orders to five of the six top hyperscalers. It expects another $1 billion in its current fiscal year.\n\"I think 2025 is going to be the year of the enterprise application,\" Robbins added. \"I think we've seen this focus on the training models that are out there and ChatGPT and Anthropic, and you got all these models that people are using. And I think now the enterprises are really figuring out what are the use cases that we can deploy.\"\nThe AI product drop comes as Cisco's stock has begun to perk up after being largely dead money for the past year amid several challenging quarters.\nShares of the networking giant are up nearly 20% in the past three months, outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 7% advance. Rival Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock is down 3% in the last months.\n\u2022 USD\n(CSCO)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCisco's stock has still underperformed, gaining only 9% in the past year compared to a 40% improvement in the S&P 500.\nThe stock's recent resurgence stems from better-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings in mid-August. Cisco surprised some on the Street by delivering product order growth of 14% and sounding optimistic about the integration of its $28 billion purchase of Splunk.\nThe Street is also growing comfortable that Cisco will have a key role in building out the world's AI infrastructure like it helped lay the structural pipes as the internet took off in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nNetworking sales \u2014a key driver of sentiment on Cisco's stock \u2014 rebounded in the quarter, spurring hope for further gains over the next 12 months.\n\"We do think there is a lot of upside potential in the current guidance, and critically, there are multiple levers for upside in FY25 across revenues and margins,\" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients. Daryanani says a successful integration of Splunk and ongoing improvement in networking demand is key to his Outperform rating on Cisco's stock.\nStory Continues\nDaryanani added, \"Our upside scenario would require both great execution and end market recovery, but we think it is a possibility.\"\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Meta has jumped more than 20% twice and dropped as much as 25% over the past eight releases, so even a 7% implied move pales in comparison.\n\u201cWe see options-implied moves for earnings across Big Tech names roughly in line with historical averages,\u201d said Celine Zhao, head of US equity research at Optiver. \u201cHowever we have not seen much of an increase in skew for these names, suggesting limited demand for downside protection around earnings. This could be due to fewer fears around market concentration, capex spending or valuations, compared with the last two quarters.\u201d\nInvestors will be closely watching the results and outlooks from the companies, which together represent more than 20% weighting in the S&P 500 index, after the stellar earnings reported by technology firms earlier in the year. The earnings will be followed next week by the closely contested US presidential election and Federal Reserve meeting, piling up a slew of potentially market-moving events for investors to protect against.\nBreaking it down a bit further, in five of the past eight quarters Apple\u2019s options implied a larger swing than was actually realized, while Microsoft options were more expensive in six of eight. On the other hand, Meta\u2019s swings have outpaced the implied moves more than half the time, sometimes by more than 10 percentage points.\nAlthough Nvidia Corp. doesn\u2019t report this week, investors will be watching capital spending outlooks closely, as four of the companies account for a large chunk of the chipmaker\u2019s sales. Near-term Nvidia option volatility edged higher on Monday.\nThe broader technology sector appears relatively inexpensive with earnings and the US election approaching, according to Goldman Sachs\u2019 derivatives sales trading desk, which sees Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (ticker QQQ) calls cheap relative to SPDR S&P 500 ETF trust (ticker SPY).\nStory Continues\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Net income was $2.12 per share, the company said Tuesday in a statement, compared with estimates of $1.84 per share.\nAs its main search business matures, Google is betting on growth from its cloud division, which supplies computing power, software and services to other companies. Google is drawing more cloud customers using its artificial intelligence expertise to gain ground on larger rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., making inroads by signing on fast-growing AI startups \u2014 some of which were founded by former Googlers \u2014 as clients.\n\u201cIn cloud, our AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers, attract new customers and win larger deals,\u201d Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in the statement.\nGoogle shares rose more than 5% in extended trading following the report. The stock has gained 21% this year.\nSales in the cloud division jumped to $11.4 billion, compared to the $10.8 billion analysts projected. Google is third in the market, after Amazon and Microsoft, but there is room for all three players to grow as companies invest in AI, Ido Caspi, a research analyst at Global X ETFs, wrote in an email. \u201cIncreasing enterprise AI workloads will continue to bolster cloud revenues,\u201d Caspi wrote.\nThe company is also making progress in addressing investor concerns about the billions it spends on AI, on infrastructure, research and more. Pichai said on a conference call with investors after the report that Google reduced the cost of giving AI answers in search queries by over 90% in 18 months, \u201cthrough hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs,\u201d while doubling the size of Gemini, the generative artificial intelligence model powering the answers.\nGoogle is also investing heavily in new forms of power, including nuclear, to handle the future load of AI\u2019s technological progress, Pichai said. And it\u2019s leaning on the technology to work more efficiently: More than a quarter of Alphabet\u2019s new computer code is written by AI, Pichai said.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet\u2019s Other Bets, an eclectic collection of nascent businesses including the self-driving car effort Waymo and the life sciences unit Verily, reported $388 million in revenue, up from $297 million in the year-ago quarter. Waymo, which Alphabet has poured money into for more than a decade, has been rapidly expanding the number of rides it offers in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. The company said last week it had raised $5.6 billion, its largest-ever funding round.\nThe Other Bets division remains unprofitable, losing $1.1 billion in the quarter, but Alphabet has been working to narrow those losses. Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s former longtime CFO who famously instilled a greater spirit of fiscal discipline in the company, recently transitioned into a new role as president and chief investment officer. She is expected to focus more on overseeing the company\u2019s Other Bets portfolio.\nWhile Google builds its prominence in the AI industry, the US government is evaluating its major successes \u2014 search and digital advertising \u2014 for antitrust harm. In August, a US judge declared Google\u2019s search business an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department and a group of states also allege that Google has monopolized the market for advertising technology tools used by websites and advertisers to buy and sell online display ads.\nOn the earnings call with investors, Pichai warned that the US government\u2019s resolution of the antitrust cases could have \u201cunintended consequences\u201d for US leadership in tech.\nEither way, \u201cit\u2019s very clear that Google can perform even in the midst of serious regulatory threats to its ads business,\u201d said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, digital advertising and media analyst at Emarketer.\n(Updates with analyst quote in the final paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

We\u2019ll spot-check a few key companies reporting after the closing bell:\n\n\nAlphabet Spells Big Q3 Beats\n\n\nGoogle and YouTube parent Alphabet GOOGL reported earnings of $2.12 per share, nicely ahead of the $1.83 in the Zacks consensus, and well beyond the $1.55 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues, minus Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), came in at $74.45 billion in the quarter, improving on the $72.85 billion anticipated (Alphabet had reported headline revenues at $88.27 billion).\n\nMost segments were modestly or notably above consensus expectations in Q3. Search Revenue reached +$49.4 billion ($49 billion had been expected), YouTube brought in $8.92 billion (versus $8.89 estimated) and Cloud fetched $11.4 billion versus $10.9 billion. Shares are up nearly +5% on the news, adding to its +22% year to date.\n\n\nAMD Trading Down on Modest Earnings Beat\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD outpaced bottom-line earnings by a penny to 92 cents per share, with a stronger top-line outperformance: $6.82 billion versus $6.71 billion in the quarter. But with Gaming revenue missing expectations, and a slightly lower guide on next-quarter sales, AMD shares are down -6% in today\u2019s after-market, cutting into the stock\u2019s +20% gain year to date.\n\n\nChipotle Posts Mixed Results, Shares Lower\n\n\nChipotle CMG posted a two-cent beat on its bottom line this afternoon, to 27 cents per share, but the fast casual giant brought its first top-line miss since July of last year. Same-store sales came in at +6%, a tad lower than the +6.3% estimate. The company listed higher avocado and dairy prices for the quarter, which were cited as the reason for the miss. Shares are down -2.5% in late trading, rolling back some of the +34% year-to-date gains.\n\n\nVisa, Which Never Misses on Earnings, Beats Again\n\n\nIn its fiscal Q4 reported today, Visa V typically surpassed estimates on its bottom line to $2.71 per share (from $2.58 in the Zacks consensus) on $9.62 billion in quarterly sales, nicely ahead of the $9.51 billion analysts had been expecting. Payments volume rose +8% in the quarter, while the company has a host of other issues, including 1400 pending job cuts and an antitrust lawsuit filed against Visa by the Department of Justice a month or so ago. Shares are up +1.5% in late trading, adding to the sub-S&P +9% year to date.\n\n\nStory Continues\nReddit Swings to Surprise Earnings, Shares +18%\n\n\nIt\u2019s only the third reported quarter for Reddit RDDT since its IPO, but the digital communities provider swung to a big positive on its bottom line \u2014 from an expected -7 cents per share to positive +16 cents for its Q3. Revenues of $348 million stormed past the $313 million in the Zacks consensus, +68% year over year. Next-quarter revenue guidance is screaming ahead to a range of $389-400 million from the earlier expected $360 million. Shares are up +17% on the news.\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author? Click here>>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, and surpassing expectations.\n\u201cThis business has real momentum and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace gen-AI,\" he said.\nThe run up in cloud revenue comes as rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are also expected to grow their cloud businesses and ramp up investments in AI infrastructure. Google plans spend roughly $13 billion on capital expenditures for the current quarter, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the call. And the company anticipates another increase in AI and data infrastructure spending in 2025.\nGoogle also faces competition on its home turf with the introduction of increasingly sophisticated AI-powered chatbots. On Monday the Information reported that Meta (META) is developing its own search engine to drive its Meta AI chatbot, providing users with conversational answers to their questions and prompts.\nHow the next generation of answer engines compete with Google's traditional and AI-boosted search remains a key question for the company.\nPichai framed the expansion of AI search tools as boosting the user experience. AI Overviews, Google's search feature that offers concise answers to user queries, now reaches 1 billion users on a monthly basis, the company announced Monday.\n\u201cPeople are asking longer and more complex questions, and exploring a wider range of websites,\" Pichai said. \"Whats particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn that Google can answer more of their questions.\"\nSimilar to legacy search results, users are shown advertisements that Google places alongside AI Overviews.\nStory Continues\nGoogle is the first of the Big Tech platforms to report this week, with Meta and Microsoft set to release quarterly results on Wednesday, followed by Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL).

Reddit was also profitable on a GAAP basis for the first time since going public, Chief Executive Officer Steve Huffman said in an interview.\nReddit\u2019s shares had already more than doubled in value before its report on Tuesday, which pushed them to a new high close to three times their initial price.\nThe company has been investing in advertising technology to help it better monetize its large audience, an investment that is showing signs of paying off in its latest report. Reddit also projected sales for the holiday quarter between $385 million and $400 million, beating analysts\u2019 projections of $356 million.\n\u201cOur hypothesis of Reddit, which is that every company\u2019s customers are on Reddit somewhere, plays out,\u201d said Huffman. \u201cWe\u2019ve been more successful in helping businesses be on Reddit, find their customers on Reddit and land their messaging.\u201d\nReddit went public nearly two decades after the forum-based site was founded. Since the spring, the social media platform has been investing heavily in its ads business as it seeks to better compete with rivals Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. It has so far launched several new ad formats, including shopping and video ads, and it has signed content partnerships with major sports leagues that in turn could help draw advertisers.\nReddit is also striking deals with artificial intelligence companies as a way to diversify its business beyond advertising. The company has data-licensing agreements with Google, OpenAI and other AI developers, who use the site\u2019s data for training large language models. In January, Reddit signed licensing deals worth $203 million in total, covering the next several years.\nHuffman said the company will continue to have more conversations with potential licensing partners, but did not name specific companies.\nThe social media site also benefits from agreements with Google and OpenAI that allow Reddit results to appear in Google searches and in ChatGPT responses. This year in the US, the word \u201cReddit\u201d was the sixth-most searched word on Google, Huffman said.

Net income was $2.12 per share, the company said Tuesday in a statement, compared with estimates of $1.84 per share.\nAs its main search business matures, Google is betting on growth from its cloud division, which supplies computing power, software and services to other companies. Google is drawing more cloud customers using its artificial intelligence expertise to gain ground on larger rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., making inroads by signing on fast-growing AI startups \u2014 some of which were founded by former Googlers \u2014 as clients.\n\u201cIn cloud, our AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers, attract new customers and win larger deals,\u201d Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in the statement.\nGoogle shares rose more than 5% in extended trading following the report. The stock has gained 21% this year.\nSales in the cloud division jumped to $11.4 billion, compared to the $10.8 billion analysts projected. Google is third in the market, after Amazon and Microsoft, but there is room for all three players to grow as companies invest in AI, Ido Caspi, a research analyst at Global X ETFs, wrote in an email. \u201cIncreasing enterprise AI workloads will continue to bolster cloud revenues,\u201d Caspi wrote.\nThe company is also making progress in addressing investor concerns about the billions it spends on AI, on infrastructure, research and more. Pichai said on a conference call with investors after the report that Google reduced the cost of giving AI answers in search queries by over 90% in 18 months, \u201cthrough hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs,\u201d while doubling the size of Gemini, the generative artificial intelligence model powering the answers.\nGoogle is also investing heavily in new forms of power, including nuclear, to handle the future load of AI\u2019s technological progress, Pichai said. And it\u2019s leaning on the technology to work more efficiently: More than a quarter of Alphabet\u2019s new computer code is written by AI, Pichai said.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet\u2019s Other Bets, an eclectic collection of nascent businesses including the self-driving car effort Waymo and the life sciences unit Verily, reported $388 million in revenue, up from $297 million in the year-ago quarter. Waymo, which Alphabet has poured money into for more than a decade, has been rapidly expanding the number of rides it offers in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. The company said last week it had raised $5.6 billion, its largest-ever funding round.\nThe Other Bets division remains unprofitable, losing $1.1 billion in the quarter, but Alphabet has been working to narrow those losses. Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s former longtime CFO who famously instilled a greater spirit of fiscal discipline in the company, recently transitioned into a new role as president and chief investment officer. She is expected to focus more on overseeing the company\u2019s Other Bets portfolio.\nWhile Google builds its prominence in the AI industry, the US government is evaluating its major successes \u2014 search and digital advertising \u2014 for antitrust harm. In August, a US judge declared Google\u2019s search business an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department and a group of states also allege that Google has monopolized the market for advertising technology tools used by websites and advertisers to buy and sell online display ads.\nOn the earnings call with investors, Pichai warned that the US government\u2019s resolution of the antitrust cases could have \u201cunintended consequences\u201d for US leadership in tech.\nEither way, \u201cit\u2019s very clear that Google can perform even in the midst of serious regulatory threats to its ads business,\u201d said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, digital advertising and media analyst at Emarketer.\n(Updates with analyst quote in the final paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

It has rocketed higher from the 2023 lows under $220, doubling off the lows before retreating to the $420s.\nThe Relative Strength Index, or RSI, last flashed an oversold \u201cBuy\u201d signal in early August when the price dipped under $400. Heading into the print Wednesday, RSI is slightly above neutral at 56.49. The range has been contracting, with a series of lower highs and higher lows.\nMoving Averages: Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.\nSupport and Resistance Levels: Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.\nChart Patterns: He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.\nVolume Analysis: He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.\nDave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Microsoft\u2019s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its EPS of $2.12 per share was also 14.8% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy Alphabet? Find out in our full research report.\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Q3 CY2024 Highlights:\nRevenue: $88.27 billion vs analyst estimates of $86.22 billion (2.4% beat)\nOperating Profit (GAAP): $28.52 billion vs analyst estimates of $26.69 billion (6.9% beat)\nEPS (GAAP): $2.12 vs analyst estimates of $1.85 (14.8% beat)\nGoogle Search Revenue: $49.39 billion vs analyst estimates of $49.15 billion (small beat)\nGoogle Cloud Revenue: $11.35 billion vs analyst estimates of $10.87 billion (4.5% beat)\nYouTube Revenue: $8.92 billion vs analyst estimates of $8.87 billion (small beat)\nGoogle Services Operating Profit: $30.86 billion vs analyst estimates of $28.64 billion (7.7% beat)\nGoogle Cloud Operating Profit: $1.95 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.12 billion (73.4% beat)\nOperating Margin: 32.3%, up from 27.8% in the same quarter last year\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 20%, down from 29.5% in the same quarter last year\nMarket Capitalization: $2.06 trillion\nKey Topics & Areas Of Debate\nAI is likely the hottest topic in the world of investing today. Regarding Alphabet, the debate is about how AI\u2019s advancement will impact the company\u2019s bread-and-butter Search business. It is a business where Alphabet has dominant market share, and it is also highly profitable.\nWill the development of AI hurt Alphabet because OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and even Microsoft\u2019s Bing will take market share from Google, once thought to be nearly invincible in the online search market? Or will Alphabet\u2019s Gemini product, first announced in December 2023, allow the company to dominate the Search market for years or even decades to come given its brand recognition?\nAs background, Gemini is designed to advance natural language understanding and meet certain thresholds in conversational and contextual understanding. In short, it is meant to provide even more accurate and personalized results, which would be a replay of what made Google so successful decades ago.\nDespite its scale and dominance, Alphabet doesn\u2019t operate in a vacuum. ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) new and improved Bing engine are current competitors to Google Search while Meta (NASDAQ:META) is extending beyond social media and into the online search market with its AI-powered assistant.\nAlphabet runs into Microsoft often, as it is also one of its primary adversaries in the public cloud services market along with Amazon\u2019s formidable AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN). Finally, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Disney (NYSE:DIS), and many other video streaming platforms go head-to-head against the company\u2019s YouTube segment.\nStory Continues\nRevenue Growth\nAlphabet proves that huge, scaled companies can still grow quickly. The company\u2019s revenue base of $155.1 billion five years ago has more than doubled to $339.9 billion in the last year, translating into an incredible 17% annualized growth rate.\nAlphabet\u2019s growth over the same period was also higher than its megacap peers, Amazon (19.1%), Microsoft (14.3%), and Apple (8.3%). Comparing the four is relevant because investors often pit them against each other to derive their valuations. With these benchmarks in mind, we think Alphabet\u2019s price is attractive.\nQuarterly Revenue of Megacap Tech Companies\nLong-term growth reigns supreme in fundamentals, but for megacap tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss emerging trends like AI. Alphabet\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 9.8% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were good and suggest demand was strong.\nAlphabet Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\nThis quarter, Alphabet reported year-on-year revenue growth of 15.1%, and its $88.27 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.4%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 10.6% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is healthy for a company of its scale and illustrates the market sees some success for its AI-enabling products.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\nGoogle Search: Alphabet\u2019s Bread-and-Butter\nThe most topical question surrounding Alphabet today is: \u201cWill new Generative-AI products like ChatGPT disrupt Google Search and its 80%+ market share?\u201d.\nWe can gain further insight by comparing Google Search to Meta and Microsoft\u2019s Bing. Meta is Alphabet\u2019s equivalent in social media advertising and is creeping into search with Meta AI, powered by the Llama large language model. Bing is a more direct competitor and benefits from its integration with ChatGPT through Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI, though it is the distant number two player.\nGoogle Search is by far the most considerable portion of Alphabet\u2019s revenue at 56.5%, and it grew at a 15.3% annualized rate over the last five years, slower than total revenue. The previous two years also saw deceleration as it grew 8.5% annually.\nWhen looking across the competitive landscape, its two-year result was lower than Meta\u2019s 12%. This shows digital advertising dollars could be flowing to social media because of Meta\u2019s improved AI algorithms and targeting capabilities. Alphabet bulls would argue this trend could reverse because the return on investment from keyword-driven advertising is more tangible, but that hasn\u2019t been the case lately.\nGoogle Search and Meta Quarterly Revenue\nQuarterly performance is particularly relevant for Alphabet because it captures the growth of AI and signals whether investors are overestimating its competitive impact. Google Search revenue met Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimates in Q3 and recorded a year-on-year increase of 12.2%.\nWhile this was slower than Bing\u2019s 16%, it\u2019s important to consider that Bing is starting from a much smaller revenue base and doesn\u2019t pose a significant threat yet. Still, Alphabet must either start topping Google Search projections or outperform in other segments like Google Cloud Platform and YouTube to satisfy Wall Street.\nKey Takeaways from Alphabet\u2019s Q3 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Alphabet exceed analysts\u2019 revenue, operating income, and EPS expectations this quarter. The segments themselves were also all solid, with Search, YouTube, and Cloud all exceeding revenue estimates. Operating profit at the segments also beat.\u00a0Guidance will be provided on the call, which could further move the stock.\u00a0Zooming out, we think this quarter was quite good. The stock traded up 3.7% to $176 immediately following the results.\nIndeed, Alphabet had a rock-solid quarterly earnings result, but is this stock a good investment here?What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free.\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nTom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management Group, states that the two things to look for in the earnings season are consumer spending and companies' spending on technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Recent reports from the financial sector and retailers suggest that consumers are in good financial shape, setting the stage for a promising holiday season as well as providing a solid opportunity for growth in the fourth quarter. He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nSometimes, these AI-related names are a bit overvalued and there is volatility; but the long-term thesis remains strong. In fact, these \u201cdown days\u201d can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major \u201cAI arms race\u201d is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings.\nJust like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn\u2019t surprised by recent market developments. It\u2019s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is \u201ceasy to hope\u201d that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, \u201creaffirms that confidence\u201d.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents.\n\u201cWe think every company in the world, whether it\u2019s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.\u201d -Taylor told CNBC in an interview.\nIn other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo\u2019s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both.\n\"Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety.\" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company\u2019s Master Perfumer\nAdvancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI\u2019s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company:\n\u201cNeither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\u201d.\nWith that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The company's AI strategy is driven by its collaboration with OpenAI, its cloud computing infrastructure, and an ever-expanding suite of AI-driven solutions.\nOn October 28, an executive from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) took to their blog to reveal the forthcoming launch of a new lobby group called the Open Cloud Coalition, which includes Google and several smaller cloud providers, to gain favor with policymakers and antitrust regulators in Europe. Microsoft has learned that Nicky Stewart will lead the organization, previously authoring complaints against Microsoft and Azure Web Services in the UK Competition and Market Authority\u2019s investigation in the cloud computing market. These \u201cshadow campaigns\u201d by Google are \u201cdesigned to discredit Microsoft with competition authorities, and policymakers and mislead the public\u201d. Labeling them as an \u201castroturf group organized by Google,\u201d Rima Alaily - CVP, Deputy General Counsel at Microsoft alleges that Google had \u201cgone through great lengths to obfuscate its involvement, funding, and control\u201d by positioning smaller European cloud providers as the face of the coalition while keeping itself at the backseat.\n\u201cIt seems Google has two ultimate goals in its astroturfing efforts: distract from the intense regulatory scrutiny Google is facing around the world by discrediting Microsoft and tilt the regulatory landscape in favor of its cloud services rather than competing on the merits\u201d. -Alaily said.\nA Google spokesperson has acknowledged its membership in the coalition and stated the following:\n\u201cWe and many others believe that Microsoft\u2019s anticompetitive practices lock-in customers and create negative downstream effects that impact cybersecurity, innovation, and choice\u201d -Google spokesperson\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Eventually, the models will be incorporated into the main part of the GitHub Copilot assistant, which can spit out code with a few simple prompts.\nAfter teaming up with OpenAI a few years ago, GitHub pioneered the use of generative artificial intelligence to automate tedious parts of the coding process. The company will continue to make the OpenAI models the default setting, but developers will be able to switch to the Google and Anthropic models if they wish, GitHub Chief Executive Officer Thomas Dohmke said in an interview.\nSince acquiring GitHub in 2018, Microsoft has let the coding platform maintain a wide array of partnerships \u2014 even if they\u2019re technically Microsoft rivals. GitHub is keen to offer customers choice and to provide options to those who use Google\u2019s and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud services. The Anthropic model will run on the network operated by Amazon Web Services.\nMicrosoft also lets its Azure cloud customers use models other than OpenAI\u2019s, including ones from Meta Inc. and Mistral, but doesn\u2019t offer models from Google or Anthropic.\nGitHub also said it\u2019s previewing an AI project called Spark that lets users create mini applications, say building a travel log with maps or an event RSVP tracker, using plain-English prompts rather than programming code.\nUsers who know how to program, can also open up the code generated by Spark and tweak it, toggling between coding and prompts. The idea is to give novices a way to create something and more experienced developers an easier way to test out ideas, Dohmke said. Developers who want to take their Spark projects further will have to move them to a fuller software development program, like GitHub Copilot or Microsoft\u2019s Power Platform.\nStill, software development with AI is becoming more capable, he said.\n\u201cThe size of the Lego blocks that Copilot on AI can generate has grown and it can assemble multiple Lego blocks together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly cannot write a whole GitHub or a whole Facebook, but the size of the building blocks will increase with AI getting better.\u201d\nStory Continues\nRead this next: AI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating\u2014With Big Consequences\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nHow Elon Musk Came to Embrace the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Delta did not immediately comment on CrowdStrike's suit.\nCrowdStrike is seeking a declaratory judgment plus legal fees.\nDelta's lawsuit filed on Friday in Fulton County Superior Court called the faulty software update from CrowdStrike \"catastrophic\" and said the company \"forced untested and faulty updates to its customers, causing more than 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to crash.\"\nDelta said the faulty update caused 7,000 flight cancellations, disrupted travel plans of 1.3 million customers and cost the carrier more than $500 million.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit, also filed on Friday, said Delta's own response and technology caused delays in the carrier's ability to resume normal operations.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit reiterated its contention that it has minimal liability, something Delta rejected.\nDelta said CrowdStrike is liable for over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses as well as for unspecified lost profits, expenditures - including legal fees - reputational harm and future revenue loss.\nThe incident prompted the U.S. Transportation Department to open an investigation.\n\"If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed,\" Delta's lawsuit says.\nDelta said it has invested billions of dollars in information technology licensing and infrastructure.\nLast month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologized before Congress for the faulty software update.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries.\nAs reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself.

Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data \u2014 cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result\u201d.\nDespite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly \u201challucinating\u201d. OpenAI may deem it to have near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy\u201d, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments.

Non-fuel expenses amounted to $170 million, while fuel costs were $50 million lower than they would have been had the flights not been cancelled. Third-quarter per-share profit was also dented by $0.45.\n\"Because the faulty update could not be removed remotely, CrowdStrike crippled Delta's business and created immense delays for Delta customers,\" the airline said in its lawsuit.\nAmid the fallout from the outage, Delta brought on David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner to seek damages from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft, including compensation for losses and litigation expenses related to the matter.\nIn a statement late on Friday cited by Reuters, CrowdStrike said Delta's claims were based on \"disproven misinformation\" and \"demostrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works.\" The lawsuit was a \"desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure,\" CrowdStrike added.\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\nRelated Articles\nCrowdStrike shares slightly lower premarket amid Delta lawsuit over summer outage\nMorgan Stanley explains why rates are rising\nEuropean shares gain as key data and US tech earnings loom\nView Comments"

But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\nCheck out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhat's The Opportunity In CrowdStrike Holdings?\nGreat news for investors \u2013 CrowdStrike Holdings is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $420.23, but it is currently trading at US$301 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from CrowdStrike Holdings?\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. CrowdStrike Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRWD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CRWD for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy CRWD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nStory Continues\nIf you want to dive deeper into CrowdStrike Holdings, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n2024 has been a big year for AI breakthroughs, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Generative AI has arguably been the biggest trend, with McKinsey estimating that it could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries annually, based on 63 use cases they analyzed. Back in 2022, when OpenAI launched its free web app, ChatGPT, few could have predicted the scale of the AI revolution that would follow. Major tech giants have since followed suit, revealing their own chatbot-based assistants, AI-enabled phones, and much more.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and\u00a020 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\nAs AI continues to revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries to new heights, today\u2019s headlines reveal just how impactful these advancements can be. The question of the hour is, with all of these big AI breakthroughs, are regulators finally catching up with developers working on their next big AI projects? Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts features an interview with Credo AI Founder and CEO Navrina Singh, discussing the sustainability of the valuations and growth of AI companies, and the potential risks they may pose. Credo AI is an AI governance platform streaming responsible AI adoption and automating oversight.\nAccording to Singh, even though AI developers may see governance as a \u201cspeed bump in innovation\u201d, companies who start with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence with the right guardrails in place will eventually end up being \u201clong-term winners\u201d. Regardless of how long it takes for governance to fully catch up, the AI frenzy continues to intensify. In recent news, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm led under the leadership of Larry Fink launched a new AI-focused exchange traded fund on Tuesday, October 22.\nTony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group, believes that AI is a growing stack of opportunity. The ETF is going to hold a concentrated portfolio of around 30 to 40 stocks, with new winners to be added as they emerge. According to Kim, the whole concept of the portfolio is to embody the concept of time and stack. That said, even though the AI trade has lost some spark, the plans and spending for advanced AI, in hopes of achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, make the portfolio very relevant.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMost of these companies in tech are all racing to get to AGI. We all have different views of AGI and when AGI will happen and what it will cost, but it will cost a lot more. Orders of magnitude more. And not only will it take that much more [money], it will take that much time\u201d.\nThat said, many of the companies that may prove to be the winners in the AI revolution may not be on investors' radars yet, or may not even have begun being publicly traded. Consider Daze, a creative AI-powered messaging application that hasn\u2019t even launched yet but already shows the potential to challenge leading platforms once it hits the market. Prelaunch, the app\u2019s waitlist is already overflowing with approximately 156,000 sign-ups (and counting).\nThe momentum of the Daze app is happening alongside broader technical advancements, such as the launch of \u201cSwifts,\u201d or stratospheric, which are AI-enabled robotic cameras that fly on weather balloons, by a New York-based startup called Near Space Labs. The technology aims to assess property risks and climate-related disasters, helping insurance companies pay out claims within days instead of weeks or months.\nIn other news, Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI has begun fundraising talks looking to double its valuation to $8 billion or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered research and conversational search engine that answers queries using natural language predictive text. Recently, the search engine has been facing numerous lawsuits from the likes of Dow Jones and the New York Post, alleging that the company uses copyrighted content unlawfully. Publishers claim that such bypasses are depriving them of advertising and subscription revenue, and also undermining the work of journalists. Even though Perplexity AI has launched a revenue-sharing program with some publishers, many still continue to push back and seek legal protection for their content.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a global cybersecurity company that provides cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data. The company employs world-class AI and ML to detect and prevent modern threats with the speed and scale of the cloud.\nOn Tuesday, October 23, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) announced that it is partnering with Omnissa, a leading digital work platform company. The partnership aims to deliver real-time threat detection and automated remediation for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and physical desktop environments, all while improving upon customers\u2019 digital work experience and productivity. The partnership, forming amid rising worldwide security threats, aims to combine CrowdStrike's AI-based endpoint security with Fortinet's network firewall technology to handle cyber-attacks.\nWhile endpoint security helps safeguard individual devices such as computers and phones, network firewalls help regulate incoming and outgoing network traffic. The combination of the two elements helps bridge the gap through collaboration, offering a holistic approach to cybersecurity, and allowing organizations to detect and respond to threats more efficiently across their entire IT infrastructure. It is also a reflection of the growing trend in the cybersecurity industry to consolidate and integrate security tools.\nOverall CRWD ranks 9th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

OpenAI has been planning a custom chip and working on such uses for the technology for around a year, the people said, but the discussions are still at an early stage.\nOpenAI declined to comment. A representative for Broadcom didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and a TSMC spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on rumors and speculation. Reuters reported on OpenAI\u2019s ongoing talks with Broadcom and TSMC on Tuesday. The Information reported in June that Broadcom had discussed making an AI chip for OpenAI.\nThe process for taking a chip from design to production is long and expensive. OpenAI is less focused on graphics processing units, chips that are used to train and build generative AI models \u2014 a market that has been cornered by Nvidia Corp. Instead, it\u2019s looking for a specialized chip that will run the software and respond to user requests, a process called inference. Investors and analysts expect the need for chips to support inference will only grow as more tech companies use AI models to field more complex tasks.\nOpenAI may continue to research setting up its own network of foundries, or chip factories, one of the people said, but the startup has realized that working with partners on custom chips is a quicker, attainable path for now. Reuters earlier reported that OpenAI was pulling back from the effort of establishing its own chip manufacturing capacity.\nBroadcom shares closed up 4.2% to $179.24 in New York trading on Tuesday. Even before the latest gain, they were up 54% this year. TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares closed more than 1% higher.\nBroadcom is the largest designer of application-specific integrated circuits \u2014 chips designed to fit a single purpose specified by the customer. The company\u2019s biggest customer in this area is Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Broadcom also works with Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\nStory Continues\nWhen asked last month whether he has new customers for the business, given the huge demand for AI training, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that he will only add to his short list of customers when projects hit volume shipments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy product to deploy for any customer, and so we do not consider proof of concepts as production volume,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call.\nOpenAI\u2019s services require massive amounts of computing power to develop and run \u2014 with much of that coming from Nvidia chips. To meet the demand, the industry has been scrambling to find alternatives to Nvidia. That\u2019s included embracing processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and developing in-house versions.\nOpenAI is also actively planning investments and partnerships in data centers, the eventual home for such AI chips. The startup\u2019s leadership has pitched the US government on the need for more massive data centers and CEO Sam Altman has sounded out global investors, including some in the Middle East, to finance the effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stretch,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told Bloomberg Television on Monday. \u201cStretch from a capital perspective but also my own learning.

Currently, OpenAI has assembled a team of roughly 20 chip engineers, including experts with experience designing Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Together, they hope to develop OpenAI's first custom chip by 2026\u2014though that timeline is flexible.\nThe news on Tuesday sent Broadcom Inc. shares up 4% and TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares gained more than 1%.\nThe move reflects OpenAI's ongoing strategy to secure consistent chip supply and manage escalating costs, a challenge that other tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft have also faced in their AI ventures. This effort includes OpenAI\u2019s recent decision to integrate AMD chips, along with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, which continue to dominate the market but are in limited supply. In fact, tech giants have been literally begging Nvidia for more chips.\nAt a meeting with analysts last month, billionaire\u00a0Oracle\u00a0cofounder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said he and world\u2019s-richest-man Elon Musk took Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang out to dinner at\u00a0Nobu\u00a0Palo Alto and \u201cbegged\u201d for more GPUs.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "By Krystal Hu, Fanny Potkin and Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - OpenAI is working with Broadcom and TSMC to build its first in-house chip designed to support its artificial intelligence systems, while adding AMD chips alongside Nvidia chips to meet its surging infrastructure demands, sources told Reuters.\nOpenAI, the fast-growing company behind ChatGPT, has examined a range of options to diversify chip supply and reduce costs. OpenAI considered building everything in-house and raising capital for an expensive plan to build a network of factories known as \"foundries\" for chip manufacturing.\nThe company has dropped the ambitious foundry plans for now due to the costs and time needed to build a network, and plans instead to focus on in-house chip design efforts, according to sources, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss private matters.\nThe company's strategy, detailed here for the first time, highlights how the Silicon Valley startup is leveraging industry partnerships and a mix of internal and external approaches to secure chip supply and manage costs like larger rivals Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft. As one of the largest buyers of chips, OpenAI's decision to source from a diverse array of chipmakers while developing its customized chip could have broader tech sector implications.\nBroadcom stock jumped following the report, finishing Tuesday's trading up over 4.5%. AMD shares also extended their gains from the morning session, ending the day up 3.7%.\nOpenAI, AMD and TSMC declined to comment. Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOpenAI, which helped commercialize generative AI that produces human-like responses to queries, relies on substantial computing power to train and run its systems. As one of the largest purchasers of Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs), OpenAI uses AI chips both to train models where the AI learns from data and for inference, applying AI to make predictions or decisions based on new information.\nReuters previously reported on OpenAI's chip design endeavors. The Information reported on talks with Broadcom and others.\nOpenAI has been working for months with Broadcom to build its first AI chip focusing on inference, according to sources. Demand right now is greater for training chips, but analysts have predicted the need for inference chips could surpass them as more AI applications are deployed.\nBroadcom helps companies including Alphabet unit Google fine-tune chip designs for manufacturing and also supplies parts of the design that help move information on and off the chips quickly. This is important in AI systems where tens of thousands of chips are strung together to work in tandem.\nStory continues\nOpenAI is still determining whether to develop or acquire other elements for its chip design, and may engage additional partners, said two of the sources.\nThe company has assembled a chip team of about 20 people, led by top engineers who have previously built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) at Google, including Thomas Norrie and Richard Ho.\nSources said that through Broadcom, OpenAI has secured manufacturing capacity with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to make its first custom-designed chip in 2026. They said the timeline could change.\nCurrently, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs hold over 80% market share. But shortages and rising costs have led major customers like Microsoft, Meta, and now OpenAI, to explore in-house or external alternatives.\nOpenAI\u2019s planned use of AMD chips through Microsoft's Azure, first reported here, shows how AMD's new MI300X chips are trying to gain a slice of the market dominated by Nvidia. AMD has projected $4.5 billion in 2024 AI chip sales, following the chip's launch in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTraining AI models and operating services like ChatGPT are expensive. OpenAI has projected a $5 billion loss this year on $3.7 billion in revenue, according to sources. Compute costs, or expenses for hardware, electricity and cloud services needed to process large datasets and develop models, are the company's largest expense, prompting efforts to optimize utilization and diversify suppliers.\nOpenAI has been cautious about poaching talent from Nvidia because it wants to maintain a good rapport with the chip maker it remains committed to working with, especially for accessing its new generation of Blackwell chips, sources added.\nNvidia declined to comment.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York, Fanny Potkin in Singapore, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, additional reporting by Anna Tong and Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and David Gregorio)"

Although markets have been volatile over the past couple of weeks, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has been making a steady climb. On Oct. 25, the Nasdaq hit an all-time high, led by mega-cap stocks ahead of their upcoming earnings and the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).\nGiven the ongoing tech rally and expectations of more rate cuts this year, it would be ideal to invest in Nasdaq stocks such as Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW, whichhave strong potential for the near term. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNasdaq Hits Record High\nOn Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.6% to close at an all-time high of 18,518.61 points. The index also closed 0.2% higher for the week, recording its seventh straight week of gains, its longest winning streak for 2024.\nYear to date, the Nasdaq Composite has gained 23.4% after soaring 43.4% in 2023, recording its best year since 2020.\nTech stocks rallied last year after a lackluster 2022 when rising interest rates negatively impacted growth stocks. The rally has since continued and gathered steam this year, boosting the Nasdaq. The current rally is largely being fueled by stocks focused on artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, which is also helping the broader market.\nAI Enthusiasm Powering Tech Rally\nWhile AI experts' opinions, particularly on the future of generative AI, are divided, the optimism surrounding this field has been enormous over the past year. Many believe that AI is still in its early stages and that its full potential has yet to be tapped. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been a frontrunner in generative AI and has been pivotal in the surge in interest in this field. Its shares have soared 185.8% year to date.\nNVIDIA\u2019s solid progress in the generative AI space has seen several tech giants trying to leave a prominent footprint in that area. Also, the advancement of smart devices is supporting the field as they require computing and learning abilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analytics. These functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, which are all favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry.\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a strong recovery as a result, following a period of challenges until the first half of 2022.\nStory Continues\nAlso, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first since March 2020. This has been further aiding growth assets, especially tech stocks. Low interest rates typically have a positive impact on growth assets. Market participants are now expecting two more interest rate cuts of 25 basis points each this year, which should further help tech stocks.\n4 Nasdaq Stocks With Upside\nAlphabet Inc.\nAlphabet Inc. is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, GOOGL has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others.\nAlphabet\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 31.9%.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year.\nThe past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries\u2019 balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022.\nThe Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging.\nThe tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end.\nHowever, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year.\nThe aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent.\nComing back to tech \u2013 the industry wouldn\u2019t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown.\nWhat\u2019s Ahead for the Market?\nThe US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a\u00a0Financial Times\u2019 survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed\u2019s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession.\nStory Continues\nFor instance, Piper Sandler\u2019s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the \u201cjumbo\u201d rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn\u2019t avert the problem.\nHowever, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists\u2019 estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn\u2019t without historical precedent.\nFurther, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week\u2019s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024.\nMoving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is \u2018tactically bullish\u2019 on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets \u201cpricing in a soft landing\u201d. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end.\nWith regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said:\n\u201cI think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we\u2019re kind of underweight on software.\u201d\nRowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don\u2019t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up.\nMethodology\nFor our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom (AVGO): Leading with Custom Silicon and Strategic Acquisitions\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n3Y CAGR: 55.87%\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been one of the most profitable stocks in the S&P500 index over the past few years. The company has been very successful in its patent portfolio strategy by acquiring other tech companies by leveraged buyouts. Some of its recent acquisitions include CA Technologies and VMware, with VMware being especially prominent.\nFurther, Broadcom is the biggest player in the custom silicon market that lets other companies design their own AI accelerators, which are increasingly opting for specific chips for specific use cases.\nFollowing is what Clearbridge Large Cap Value strategy had to say about AVGO in their Q3, 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Broadcom is:\n8.4% = US$5.5b \u00f7 US$66b (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2024).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.\nDoes Broadcom Have A Good Return On Equity?\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Broadcom has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Semiconductor industry classification.\nroe\nUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Broadcom visit our risks dashboard for free.\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\nBroadcom's Debt And Its 8.4% ROE\nBroadcom clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.06. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\nStory Continues\nSummary\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\nOf course Broadcom may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, emphasized the ongoing significance of fossil fuels in supporting technological advancements, even as investments in renewable energy continue to increase. He stated:\n\u201cThis is not just a grudge match between the old and the new, a battle of electric vehicles versus internal combustion. The truth is, fossil fuels are essential for a lot more than vehicles, like it or not.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Stock Picks\nCramer highlighted the growing energy demands of major tech companies, noting that the data centers they are constructing consume vast amounts of electricity. While these tech giants are making substantial investments in nuclear energy, he pointed out that this power source is unlikely to significantly impact data centers for at least another decade due to the complexities of building nuclear facilities and community resistance to having them nearby.\n\u201cIf we need more energy, we\u2019re going to get it from what comes out of the ground \u2026 fossil fuels that will power the data center, specifically natural gas\u2026 You may be reluctant to invest in it, you might think who cares, but you need to know how vital all of this fossil fuel technology is to the growth of the Magnificent Seven.\u201d\nCramer also reflected on the shift in the U.S. energy landscape, recalling how the nation was once heavily reliant on OPEC for oil imports just two decades ago. Today, he pointed out, the U.S. produces over 13 million barrels per day, making it the largest oil producer globally and a net exporter. He mentioned the Permian Basin's unexpected resilience, continually producing despite earlier predictions of depletion.\nCramer noted that the decline of OPEC has transformed the geopolitical landscape. He referenced the 1973 oil crisis, triggered by OPEC's retaliation against U.S. support for Israel, which led to stagflation and economic turmoil. In contrast, he pointed out that despite Israel's current conflict, the U.S. economy is not experiencing stagflation or recession, resulting instead in a bull market. He attributed this stability to the industry, saying:\n\u201c... This industry that spent billions upon billions of dollars to try to be as low carbon as possible is the reason why oil prices have actually come down during this period. They've gotten so much production that OPEC is now powerless.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTurning his attention to the broader oil industry, Cramer explored the role of oil service companies that facilitate production, including offshore drillers. He recalled becoming optimistic about oil service stocks earlier in the year, anticipating higher energy prices but admitted that this expectation did not materialize due to economic concerns dampening oil and gas markets. Despite current investor reluctance toward oil service stocks, Cramer suggested that sentiment could shift over time, especially because of the Federal Reserve's recent rate cutting.\n\u201cNow that the FED is our friend and more rate cuts are on the table, that's good news for the industry. I am not worried about the election either. If Trump wins, maybe we're back to that \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d thing. If Harris wins, we get exactly what we've had the last four years. Not ideal for the industry but it's still led to record oil and gas production here in the United States.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 23 and 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nCramer expressed enthusiasm about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) and said, \u201cBuy. Charitable Trust name, doing incredibly well\u2026 I like Broadcom, I like Hock Tan.\u201d\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) specializes in the design, development, and supply of semiconductor devices, building on a strong foundation in semiconductor innovation. In the third quarter, the company reported total revenue of $13.1 billion, marking a significant increase of 47% from the same period last year. A contributor to this growth has been the surge in demand for artificial intelligence products and services, which brought in $3.1 billion during the quarter.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects that AI will become a key driver of growth moving forward, projecting $3.5 billion in AI revenue for the upcoming fourth quarter. The company has found considerable success in providing custom AI accelerators, specialized chips designed to handle AI workloads, to major hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. In the third quarter, sales of these AI accelerators skyrocketed, increasing by three and a half times compared to the previous year.\nOn October 14, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $220 from $190 and maintained an Outperform rating. The firm forecasts tailwinds in artificial intelligence, custom silicon, and networking through 2025 and 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.\nThe third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\nWhile these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark.\nWang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.\nFAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters.\n2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies such as the industry\u2019s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. To keep its strategy active, on October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom\u2019s subsidiary, T-Systems. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider.\nOn June 13, Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, appeared in an Interview on Yahoo Finance where she shared her bullish stance on AVGO. Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man\u2019s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components.\nAs Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) and RTX Corp. (RTX), as well as a micro-cap stock FONAR Corp. (FONR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nShares of Apple have gained +21.7% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry\u2019s gain of +22.4%. The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter\u2019s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s shares have gained +9.2% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry\u2019s gain of +19.7%. The company\u2019s diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy are performing well, fueled by increasing demand. Label expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.\n\nNovo Nordisk has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by making serious investments in increasing its manufacturing capabilities. It is now indicated in the United States and the EU to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost. The positive recommendation in the EU for approval of Wegovy for heart failure is also encouraging.\n\nHowever, the CRL for insulin icodec in the United States is a setback for the company. Intense competition in the obesity sector also threatens Novo Nordisk\u2019s market share. Patent expiry, pricing pressures across the diabetes market and the pipeline setbacks remain concerning. Estimates have declined ahead of third-quarter earnings results.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\n\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+62.2% vs. +5.0%). The company ended Q3 2024 on a solid note, with both its earnings and sales having surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It continues to receive ample orders for its wide range of combat-proven defense products from the Pentagon and our foreign allies.\n\nImproving commercial air traffic has been bolstering the company\u2019s operating results. RTX holds a solid financial position, which enables it to make successful share repurchases. The company\u2019s shares have outperformed its industry in the past year.\n\nHowever, potentially rising crude prices tens to put cost pressures on airlines that may affect the operating results of commercial OEM producers like RTX. The company may also be affected if China enforces its announced sanctions against its missile and defense unit. Supply-chain challenges also pose a threat to RTX.\n\n(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)\n\nFONAR\u2019s shares have gained +15.9% over the past year versus the Zacks Medical - Products industry\u2019s gain of +33.8%. This microcap company, with a market capitalization of $97.4 million, demonstrated stable growth, with fiscal 2024 revenues up 4.3% to $102.9 million, driven by its subsidiary HMCA\u2019s 4.6% growth in diagnostic imaging. Managing 42 MRI scanners, FONAR expands its market with a unique Upright MRI, enhancing diagnostic options.\n\nOperational efficiency improved, with a 16.3% rise in net income to $14.1 million. A cash position of $56.3 million enables growth initiatives, while Upright MRI differentiates FONAR via unique scan capabilities. MRI scan volume grew 11%, reflecting strong demand, supported by tech upgrades like SwiftMR.\n\nYet, risks include vulnerability to reimbursement cuts, inflationary costs, competition from larger players, and reliance on the Upright MRI and regulatory pressures, particularly in core markets New York and Florida. Value-based care trends add further risk to its long-term stability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on FONAR here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ServiceNow, Inc.

          "whole_article": "Tuesday, October 29, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) and RTX Corp. (RTX), as well as a micro-cap stock FONAR Corp. (FONR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nShares of Apple have gained +21.7% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry\u2019s gain of +22.4%. The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter\u2019s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s shares have gained +9.2% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry\u2019s gain of +19.7%. The company\u2019s diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy are performing well, fueled by increasing demand. Label expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.\n\nNovo Nordisk has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by making serious investments in increasing its manufacturing capabilities. It is now indicated in the United States and the EU to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost. The positive recommendation in the EU for approval of Wegovy for heart failure is also encouraging.\n\nHowever, the CRL for insulin icodec in the United States is a setback for the company. Intense competition in the obesity sector also threatens Novo Nordisk\u2019s market share. Patent expiry, pricing pressures across the diabetes market and the pipeline setbacks remain concerning. Estimates have declined ahead of third-quarter earnings results.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\n\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+62.2% vs. +5.0%). The company ended Q3 2024 on a solid note, with both its earnings and sales having surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It continues to receive ample orders for its wide range of combat-proven defense products from the Pentagon and our foreign allies.\n\nImproving commercial air traffic has been bolstering the company\u2019s operating results. RTX holds a solid financial position, which enables it to make successful share repurchases. The company\u2019s shares have outperformed its industry in the past year.\n\nHowever, potentially rising crude prices tens to put cost pressures on airlines that may affect the operating results of commercial OEM producers like RTX. The company may also be affected if China enforces its announced sanctions against its missile and defense unit. Supply-chain challenges also pose a threat to RTX.\n\n(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)\n\nFONAR\u2019s shares have gained +15.9% over the past year versus the Zacks Medical - Products industry\u2019s gain of +33.8%. This microcap company, with a market capitalization of $97.4 million, demonstrated stable growth, with fiscal 2024 revenues up 4.3% to $102.9 million, driven by its subsidiary HMCA\u2019s 4.6% growth in diagnostic imaging. Managing 42 MRI scanners, FONAR expands its market with a unique Upright MRI, enhancing diagnostic options.\n\nOperational efficiency improved, with a 16.3% rise in net income to $14.1 million. A cash position of $56.3 million enables growth initiatives, while Upright MRI differentiates FONAR via unique scan capabilities. MRI scan volume grew 11%, reflecting strong demand, supported by tech upgrades like SwiftMR.\n\nYet, risks include vulnerability to reimbursement cuts, inflationary costs, competition from larger players, and reliance on the Upright MRI and regulatory pressures, particularly in core markets New York and Florida. Value-based care trends add further risk to its long-term stability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on FONAR here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW), Equinor ASA (EQNR) and IQVIA Holdings Inc. (IQV).\n\nMark Vickery\nSenior Editor\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ServiceNow, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NOW a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $13.83.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.3%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.36 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for NOW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Darren. Good afternoon, everyone, I really appreciate you joining today. Because a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report, I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow is growth trajectory. First is elite level execution, with our Q3 results we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution.\nWe outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand.

Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

Overall, this was a strong quarter.\nIs now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million.\nAlso, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 39.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $959.64 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,034.\nStory Continues\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Analyzers pointed out, nonetheless, a slowing down in cRPO growth relative to Q2 and suggested a possible slowing down in Q4. Still, they underlined ServiceNow's strong foundation for monetizing generative artificial intelligence solutions by 2025.\nFollowing in line, Stifel and RBC raised their price estimates to $990 and $1,045, respectively.

Current remaining performance obligation, a measure of booked sales, increased 26% in the period ending Sept. 30. Both exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company makes applications that help companies organize and automate their personnel and information technology operations. Like its peers, ServiceNow is baking generative AI features into its products and offers a pricier tier with those tools.\nThe company\u2019s main generative AI assistant product, Now Assist, is the fastest-growing in company history, Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott said in an interview. The average contract premium for users of Now Assist is 30%, he added.\nThe shares hit a record high Thursday in New York, jumping about 6%. Investors were initially unimpressed with the results, with the stock trading down Wednesday evening. The shares had increased 28% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close. That\u2019s more than twice the rally seen in the iShares Expanded Software ETF, which is often used as a sector benchmark.\nThe results \u201cvalidate the company\u2019s rare standing in enterprise software,\u201d wrote Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup. He cited strong execution in a tough environment for tech spending and early monetization of generative AI.\nIn recent weeks, ServiceNow and software peers like Salesforce Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have begun emphasizing AI \u201cagents\u201d that can complete tasks without user supervision. Some customers are already trying ServiceNow\u2019s agents, which will be released more broadly next month, McDermott said. Once the agents are fully rolled out, they\u2019ll be priced differently from other products, McDermott added.\nFor the current quarter ending in December, ServiceNow projected subscription revenue of about $2.88 billion, just ahead of analyst estimates. The company expects near-term bookings to rise 21.5%.\nThis bookings guidance was effectively \u201cgood, but not great,\u201d Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note. He added that the company tends to issue conservative forecasts for the fourth quarter.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also announced the hiring of a leader from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Cloud for a prominent role. Amit Zavery will fill titles vacated earlier this year by CJ Desai as president, chief product officer and chief operating officer. Zavery will focus on product and engineering, McDermott said. His first-year compensation is targeted at about $2 million, with a $3 million signing bonus, according to a filing.\nDesai left the company in July after a complaint about a government contract and the hiring of a former US Army technology leader. He has since been tapped for a high-level executive role at Cloudflare Inc.\nLast month, Bloomberg reported that Carahsoft Technology Corp., a government-focused technology reseller, was under investigation alongside SAP SE for potentially conspiring to overcharge federal agencies.\nCarahsoft is also a major partner of ServiceNow\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re currently not involved in any issues related to Carahsoft and the US federal business,\u201d McDermott said when asked about the issue during a call with analysts Wednesday.\nProfit, excluding some items, was $3.72 per share, ahead of analyst estimates. The company saw a spike in large deals worth more than $5 million in annual contract value, it said.\nServiceNow hired more than 1,200 workers in the quarter. The company now has 25,743 employees. Much of the hiring is of quota-bearing sales representatives, which shows \u201cour confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Gina Mastantuono during the call.\n(Updates share reaction in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nThe Print Magazine Revival of 2024\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4.\nAs LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission.\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term.\n\u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d\nHowever, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying.\nREAD ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nThe analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity.

Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired.
