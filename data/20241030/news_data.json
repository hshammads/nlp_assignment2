          "whole_article": "Reddit (RDDT) is wearing its new popularity well.\nShares of the social media platform exploded over 40% on Tuesday following the company's first-ever profitable quarter.\n\"I think we're hitting a kind of an era of mainstream for Reddit,\" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance (video above). \"We finally made the product easy enough to use that we're hitting this tier of mainstream-ness.\"\nReddit's global daily active users increased 47% year over year to 97.2 million. Weekly global active unique users rose 53% from the prior year.\nTotal revenue improved 68% to $348.4 million due mostly to strength in advertising as clients grew more comfortable putting dollars toward the controversial site. Analysts had expected sales of $314 million. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $94.1 million versus a $6.9 million loss a year ago.\nEarnings per share of $0.16 marked a reversal from a $0.13 loss last year. The Street was modeling for a loss of $0.07.\n\u2022 USD\n(RDDT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nFor Reddit, the third quarter was another win for 2024.\nInitially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, the company ended up pricing at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation. The targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion it fetched in a 2021 funding round.\nThe stock began trading at $47 per share and quickly shot past $53.\nShares finished their first day of trading on March 21 at $50.44.\nThe stock currently trades at around $112. Reddit's market cap is now roughly $18.6 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nThis option is unavailable due to your privacy preferences. Please update your privacy settings to enable it.\nThe company was the first major social media IPO since Pinterest (PINS) debuted in 2019.\nReddit's IPO came on the heels of a licensing deal with Google to use its data to train large language models. In May, Reddit entered a similar deal with OpenAI.\n\"We think Reddit has multiple avenues to drive impressions and pricing higher over time, which contributes to an impressive growth profile for advertising revenue. Reddit has an attractive call option from data licensing, which provides high-margin ancillary revenue,\" said Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni following the company's third quarter earnings release.\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

It\u2019s also offering the platform as open-source software. To that end, Meta reported that organizations ranging from Accenture (ACN) and DoorDash (DASH) to Goldman Sachs (GS) are using Llama to develop their own AI software.\nMeta\u2019s earnings follow a report by The Information that the company is working on its own search functionality for its Meta AI service that will allow users to ask questions and get answers about current events. The goal is to ensure Meta will no longer have to rely on Google's or Microsoft\u2019s search engines to answer certain user queries.\nThe company is also coming off of a successful Meta Connect conference, during which it debuted a working prototype of its Orion augmented reality glasses. The device, which is still in early development, is meant to serve as a pair of glasses that allow you to speak with other users via holograms projected onto the real world.\nStory Continues\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shows off a prototype of the company's Orion augmented reality glasses at Meta Connect in October.

Its GAAP profit of $6.03 per share was 13.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy Meta? Find out in our full research report.\nMeta (META) Q3 CY2024 Highlights:\nRevenue: $40.59 billion vs analyst estimates of $40.31 billion (in line)\nEPS: $6.03 vs analyst estimates of $5.29 (13.9% beat)\nEBITDA: $25.63 billion vs analyst estimates of $24.06 billion (6.5% beat)\nRevenue Guidance for Q4 CY2024 is $46.5 billion at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting\nGross Margin (GAAP): 81.8%, in line with the same quarter last year\nOperating Margin: 42.7%, up from 40.3% in the same quarter last year\nEBITDA Margin: 63.1%, up from 60% in the same quarter last year\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 38.2%, up from 28.7% in the previous quarter\nDaily Active People: 3.29 billion, up 150 million year on year\nMarket Capitalization: $1.50 trillion\n\"We had a good quarter driven by AI progress across our apps and business,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO.\nCompany Overview\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Reality Labs.\nSocial Networking\nBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\nSales Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term performance can give signals about its business quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, Meta\u2019s 11.6% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was decent. This is a useful starting point for our analysis.\nMeta Total Revenue\nThis quarter, Meta\u2019s year-on-year revenue growth was 18.9%, and its $40.59 billion of revenue was in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Management is currently guiding for a 15.9% year-on-year increase next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 14.4% over the next 12 months, an acceleration versus the last three years. This projection is admirable and shows the market believes its newer products and services will catalyze higher growth rates.\nStory Continues\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\nDaily Active People\nUser Growth\nAs a social network, Meta generates revenue growth by increasing its user base and charging advertisers more for the ads each user is shown.\nOver the last two years, Meta\u2019s daily active people, a key performance metric for the company, increased by 6.3% annually to 3.29 billion in the latest quarter. This growth rate is slightly below average for a consumer internet business and is largely a function of its already massive scale and penetrated market. If Meta wants to reach the next level, it must innovate with new products.\nMeta Daily Active People\nIn Q3, Meta added 150 million daily active people, leading to 4.8% year-on-year growth. The quarterly print was lower than its two-year result, suggesting its new initiatives aren\u2019t accelerating user growth just yet.\nRevenue Per User\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Meta because it measures how much the company earns from the ads shown to its users. ARPU can also be a proxy for how valuable advertisers find Meta\u2019s audience and its ad-targeting capabilities.\nMeta\u2019s ARPU growth has been impressive over the last two years, averaging 8.8%. Its ability to increase monetization while growing its daily active people demonstrates its platform\u2019s value, as its users continue to spend more each year.\nMeta ARPU\nThis quarter, Meta\u2019s ARPU clocked in at $12.34. It grew 13.4% year on year, faster than its daily active people.\nKey Takeaways from Meta\u2019s Q3 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Meta blew past analysts\u2019 EBITDA and EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its daily active people missed and it called for \"significant capital expenditures growth in 2025\". Overall, this quarter had some key positives, but the market seemed to focus on the aggressive infrastructure investments that will come next year. The stock traded down 3.2% to $573 immediately after reporting.\nSo should you invest in Meta right now?We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free.\nView Comments"

With Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) set to report this week, Capital Fund Management head of macro strategy Christian Dery joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of the Magnificent Seven on the broader market. \u201cThese companies have gotten so large that on earnings events\u2026you're getting these swings in market cap on the order of $2 [billion] to $400 billion,\u201d Dery says, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA) and its impact on the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) specifically. The chipmaker doesn\u2019t report earnings until Nov. 20. As the Magnificent Seven companies report earnings, capital spending will likely be closely watched by investors as Big Tech companies invest billions into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure without a definitive timeline on AI monetization. The strategist says, \u201cThe reality is that the existing incumbents have to build out this technology because they can't risk falling behind their competitors,\u201d but \u201cWe haven't found the killer use case just yet, and the market is going to start to be more discerning in terms of [the] path to profitability scale.

It even released the source code for some parts of PCC on GitHub.\nThen it outlined the rewards for anyone willing to give it a whirl: Anywhere from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, depending on the difficulty and gravity of the hack.\nThe parameters of the bug bounty\nSo just how much could you take home if you manage to break into Apple\u2019s servers?\u00a0\u201cWe award maximum amounts for vulnerabilities that compromise user data and inference request data outside the PCC trust boundary,\u201d Apple explained, before breaking down the bug bounty on offer.\nIf you're able to hit upon \"accidental or unexpected data disclosure due to deployment or configuration issue,\" you'll get $50,000.\nMoving up the chain, if you can \"execute unattested code,\" you'll get $100,000.\nGaining \"access to a user's request data or other sensitive information about the user outside the trust boundary\" gets you $150,000, while access to sensitive information about the user's requests outside the trust boundary gets $250,000.\nIn the blog post explaining the challenge, Apple wrote that it considers PCC to be the \u201cmost advanced security architecture ever deployed for cloud AI compute at scale, and we look forward to working with the research community to build trust in the system and make it even more secure and private over time.\u201d\nStory Continues\nWhat's more, if a hacker spots a security issue not covered by Apple\u2019s outline, the company still promises to consider providing a bounty, it wrote.\nAnd the big-ticket ask? If a hacker is able to pull off \u201carbitrary execution of code without the user's permission or knowledge with arbitrary entitlements,\u201d they\u2019ll be awarded $1,000,000.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) are each updating investors on their financial performance over the past few months, and AI is top of mind across the board.\nAlphabet and AMD reported their results Tuesday, and while both performed well \u2014 Alphabet beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on the top and bottom lines, and AMD met expectations on revenue and beat on earnings per share \u2014 shares of the companies are heading in opposite directions, with Alphabet shares headed higher and AMD shares sliding.\nBeyond the earnings rush, there was one other big story this week: Apple\u2019s cavalcade of product announcements. The company not only released its initial batch of Apple Intelligence features through software updates for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, it also unveiled a line of new Mac laptops and desktops, as well as two new high-powered chips.\nIt\u2019s been a heck of a week so far, and we\u2019ve still got two days to go.\nEarnings take center stage\nBig Tech\u2019s earnings season feels like it\u2019s been compressed into a single week, which is both a blessing and a curse for yours truly. Sure, it gets all of the work out of the way in one shot, but it also means my keyboard is getting a heck of a workout.\nAMD CEO Lisa Su makes the opening speech at COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 3, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo) \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nGoogle parent Alphabet and AMD both provided solid results on Tuesday, but investors weren\u2019t happy with AMD\u2019s guidance for the current quarter, sending shares sliding more than 9% in early trading Wednesday. Alphabet shares, meanwhile, climbed more than 6% on the strength of its AI and cloud business growth.\nAMD said that it expects to see Q4 revenue of between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, which was just shy of expectations of $7.55 billion. That\u2019s not exactly the kind of beat and raise Wall Street has come to expect from AI chip names. Still, even at the low end of guidance, AMD\u2019s Q4 revenue would jump $1 billion versus the $6.2 billion it brought in during the same period last year.\nDespite disappointment among traders, CEO Lisa Su said there\u2019s an \u201cinsatiable demand for more computers\u201d among customers.\nAlphabet, on the other hand, is on a roll, thanks to growth in its advertising and cloud services revenue. Ad sales beat expectations, jumping from $59.6 billion a year ago to $65.8 billion in its most recent quarter, while cloud revenue increased a whopping 35%.\nBoth businesses benefit from Google\u2019s AI investments, with AI for Alphabet\u2019s cloud platform helping to draw enterprise customers and improving advertising services. But Alphabet has plenty of competition, including Microsoft, which reports after the bell on Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. There\u2019s still plenty of earnings news ahead, so stay tuned.\nStory Continues\nApple kicks off week of Mac announcements, starts big AI rollout\nApple is also having a heck of a week, with updates to its iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro lines of desktops and laptops; the debut of two new chips (the M4 Pro and M4 Max); and the rollout of its Apple Intelligence platform.\nThe new iMac gets upgraded performance via the company\u2019s M4 chip, which first debuted alongside the new iPad Pro back in May. Apple also outfitted the iMac with a new nanotexture display coating to reduce glare and the company\u2019s Center Stage camera that keeps subjects in frame during video calls.\nThe MacBook Pro is available in both 14-inch and 16-inch models. (Apple) \u00b7 Apple\nThe Mac mini, meanwhile, gets a full redesign that shrinks its footprint to 5 inches by 5 inches. Despite its smaller size, the pint-sized mini is also more powerful than its predecessor, thanks to the inclusion of Apple\u2019s M4 chip, as well as the option to upgrade to the new M4 Pro for even greater performance gains.\nThen there\u2019s the MacBook Pro, which is available with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. Apple says the Pro can also be equipped with a nanotexture display like the iMac and that it now gets up to 24 hours of battery life.\nAll of the systems are also built with Apple Intelligence in mind. Available via iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS 15.1, Apple Intelligence is the company\u2019s first major step into the generative AI space. But the company is releasing the software in stages throughout the end of this year and across 2025. The first set of capabilities won\u2019t exactly blow consumers\u2019 minds, either.\nThe platform\u2019s flashiest feature is its notification summaries for texts, news updates, and other messages. But Apple plans to add ChatGPT integration to Siri and release its Apple Intelligence update in the coming months, which should prove far more exciting.\nFor more on Apple Intelligence, check out my review.\nMore tech stories\nThat\u2019s not all that\u2019s happening this week in tech.

(Image: Apple) \u00b7 Apple\nApple\u2019s MacBook Pro laptops are designed for users in need of heavy duty machines that can handle everything from video editing to 3D modeling and more. And the company promises its latest line of Pros can do that and more.\nThe Pro line includes both the MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch. The 14-inch starts at $1,599 and includes Apple\u2019s M4 chip and 16GB of memory. The 16-inch model starts at $2,499 and comes with the M4 Pro and 24GB of memory.\nApple debuted its M4 back in April alongside its latest iPad Pro offerings and announced the more powerful M4 Pro with the Mac mini on Tuesday. The M4 Pro features a 14-core central processing unit (CPU), 20-core graphics processing unit (GPU), and 16-core neural engine for processing AI tasks. Overall, Apple says the M4 Pro\u2019s CPU is 1.8x faster than the M4\u2019s and that its GPU is 2.2x faster than the M4\u2019s GPU.\nThe MacBook Pro is available in both 14-inch and 16-inch models. (Image: Apple) \u00b7 Apple\nOverall, Apple says the MacBook Pro 16-inch with an M4 Pro chip is 3x faster than the MacBook Pro 16-inch with an M1 Pro chip. But the M4 Max takes things a step further.\nAvailable with up to a 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, and 16-core neural engine with up to 128 GB of memory, the MacBook Pro 16-inch with the M4 Max should be a beast of a machine. In fact, Apple says the system is 3.5x faster than the MacBook Pro 16-inch with an M1 Max chip.\nDespite the performance gains, Apple says the MacBook Pro will still get up to 24 hours of battery life.\nIn addition to their improved performance, Apple says the MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch now include three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports when outfitted with the M4 chip. Those jump to Thunderbolt 5 when you select the M4 Pro or M4 Max.\nStory Continues\n\u2022 USD\n(AAPL)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThunderbolt is a version of USB-C that offers exceptionally high data transfer rates. Thunderbolt 5, for instance, can reach speeds of up to 120 gigabits per second. That means you\u2019ll be able to connect multiple high-resolution monitors and send and receive data from external data drives more quickly.\nThe new MacBook Pros also come with updated 12-megapixel Center Stage cameras that can automatically track individual or multiple users\u2019 movements as they move to ensure everyone stays in the frame at the same time during video calls.\nThere\u2019s also a nanotexture coating option available for the MacBook Pros\u2019 displays to reduce glare when used in well-lit environments.\nBeyond the Pros and new M4 chips, Apple also announced that it is increasing the base memory of M2 and M3-powered MacBook Airs from 8GB to 16GB while keeping its price at $999.\nThe move is likely meant to improve the M2- and M3-powered Macs\u2019 performance while using Apple\u2019s Apple Intelligence platform and its on-device AI features.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

It\u2019s up to 1.9x faster than the CPU of M1 Pro, and up to 2.1x faster than the latest AI PC chip.2 The GPU features up to 20 cores for graphics performance that is 2x that of M4, and up to 2.4x faster than the latest AI PC chip.2 This huge boost in performance makes building and testing apps across multiple simulators in Xcode\u00ae quicker than ever. And with the improved hardware-accelerated ray-tracing engine in the M4 family GPU, games like Control look more compelling, and pro 3D renderers can produce stunning imagery in even less time.\nM4 Pro supports up to 64GB of fast unified memory and 273GB/s of memory bandwidth, which is a massive 75 percent increase over M3 Pro and 2x the bandwidth of any AI PC chip.3 This, combined with the faster Neural Engine of the M4 family, means on-device Apple Intelligence models run at blazing speed. M4 Pro also supports Thunderbolt 5 on Mac, delivering up to 120Gb/s data transfer speeds, which more than doubles the throughput of Thunderbolt 4. For professionals working on larger file sizes across AI, video, code bases, and more, M4 Pro offers stunning performance and Apple silicon\u2019s legendary power efficiency.\nM4 Max: The Most Powerful Chip for a Pro Laptop\nM4 Max is the ultimate choice for data scientists, 3D artists, and composers who push pro workflows to the limit. It has an up to 16-core CPU, with up to 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores. It\u2019s up to 2.2x faster than the CPU in M1 Max and up to 2.5x faster than the latest AI PC chip.2 The GPU has up to 40 cores for performance that is up to 1.9x faster than M1 Max and up to an astounding 4x faster than the latest AI PC chip.2 So heavy workloads like de-noising raw video footage in DaVinci Resolve Studio can now run in real time.\nM4 Max supports up to 128GB of fast unified memory and up to 546GB/s of memory bandwidth, which is 4x the bandwidth of the latest AI PC chip.3 This allows developers to easily interact with large language models that have nearly 200 billion parameters. The enhanced Media Engine of M4 Max includes two video encode engines and two ProRes\u00ae accelerators, making it the ultimate choice for video professionals. And like M4 Pro, M4 Max also supports Thunderbolt 5 with up to 120Gb/s data transfer capability. M4 Max rips through the most challenging pro workloads and, thanks to the energy efficiency of Apple silicon, delivers exceptional battery life in a laptop.\nApple Silicon Powers Apple Intelligence\nM4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max are built for Apple Intelligence.4 Ushering in a new era for the Mac, Apple Intelligence brings personal intelligence to the personal computer. Combining powerful generative models with industry-first privacy protections, Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine to unlock new ways for users to work, communicate, and express themselves on Mac. It is available in U.S. English with macOS\u00ae Sequoia 15.1. With systemwide Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write. With the newly redesigned Siri\u00ae, users can move fluidly between spoken and typed requests to accelerate tasks throughout their day, and Siri can answer thousands of questions about Mac and other Apple products. New Apple Intelligence features will be available in December, with additional capabilities rolling out in the coming months. Image Playground gives users a new way to create fun original images, and Genmoji\u2122 allows them to create custom emoji in seconds. Siri will become even more capable, with the ability to take actions across the system and draw on a user\u2019s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. In December, ChatGPT will be integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, allowing users to access its expertise without needing to jump between tools.\nApple Intelligence does all this while protecting users\u2019 privacy at every step. At its core is on-device processing, and for more complex tasks, Private Cloud Compute gives users access to Apple\u2019s even larger, server-based models and offers groundbreaking protections for personal information. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in \u2014 their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won\u2019t store requests. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI\u2019s data-use policies apply.\nBetter for the Environment\nThe power-efficient performance of M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max helps the all-new MacBook Pro\u00ae lineup meet Apple\u2019s high standards for energy efficiency and deliver up to 24 hours of battery life.5 This results in less time needing to be plugged in and less energy consumed over its lifetime. And for desktop systems like iMac\u00ae and Mac mini\u00ae, the energy efficiency of Apple silicon also reduces the total amount of energy used. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations and, as part of its ambitious Apple 2030 goal, plans to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade.\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple\u2019s six software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Apple\u2019s more than 150,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth and to leaving the world better than we found it.\nFootnotes\n1 Testing was conducted by Apple in October 2024 using shipping competitive systems and select industry-standard benchmarks.\n2 Testing was conducted by Apple in October 2024 using select industry-standard benchmarks. AI PC chip performance data from testing MSI Prestige 13 AI+ Evo (A2VMG-014US) with Core Ultra 7 258V.\n3 Based on published technical specifications of shipping competitive chips as of October 2024.\n4 Apple Intelligence is available now as a free software update for Mac with M1 and later, and can be accessed in most regions around the world when the device and Siri language are set to U.S. English.

          "whole_article": "Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\nThe economy continues to chug along, and this week's batch of economic data \u2014 GDP, JOLTs, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, and a jobs report \u2014 is expected to provide evidence that the soft landing is here.\nBut it hardly feels like a landing. There's too much going on, from Big Tech earnings and crazy weather effects on data to an impending election. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) just closed at its 28th record high of the year Tuesday.\nBut that's not just it.\nSchwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon, who recently appeared on Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation, described a certain cognitive dissonance investors face.\nThis option is unavailable due to your privacy preferences. Please update your privacy settings to enable it.\n\"We're living through the soft landing now,\" he said, adding, \"It's not a destination in my mind. It's a process.\" In that regard, Gordon agrees with San Francisco Federal Reserve president Mary Daly. She recently penned an article, \"Landing Softly is Just the Beginning,\" in which she liberally uses the preferred term \"sustained expansion.\"\nTo their point, all the talk about landings might have been putting the cart before the horse.\nIt's worth remembering that until we get a nationwide recession, we'll still be living in the midst of the pandemic expansion that began with the restart of the US economy following a historic lockdown.\nWe can see this clearly by analyzing the GDP metric that will be updated this week.\nAfter the historic drop and surge of 2020, US growth has remained robust except for the first couple of quarters in 2022. And the recent revision to Q2 2022 GDP, which flipped it to positive from negative, only strengthens the arguments for continuous expansion.\nWhile this cycle expansion is now in its fourth year, astute investors will recall that we only recently celebrated the two-year anniversary of this bull market. Digging into this mismatch helps explain why this bull market has bucked most of the norms of the prior four decades.\n\"It is a weird bull market,\" Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said in another episode of Stocks in Translation. \"I'm scratching my head too,\" she added.\n\"[We thought that] small caps [were] going lead us to the races,\" Cox said. Small-cap indexes like the Russell 2000 (^RUT) continued to make new lows as the megacaps were off to the races in 2023.\nBut Cox raised the other key insight that distinguishes the current bull market from others over the last 40 years. \"[The weird market] was a product of the rate environment,\" Cox said. And it's here that the Fed has perhaps surprised investors and business owners the most.\nStory Continues\nMore from Stocks in Translation:\nWhy this investment strategist is a 'fan of bonds' right now\nHow a strong jobs market has kept the stock rally going\nWhat sets Jerome Powell apart from his Fed peers\nDespite the most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in 40 years that was designed to choke off the easy-money spigot for businesses \u2014 non-bank corporations in the US have actually seen the burden of their interest payments trend down continuously since the pandemic, as highlighted by Apollo's chief economist and partner Torsten Sl\u00f8k. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\n\"To be sure, firms with weak earnings, weak revenue, and weak cash flows have been hit by Fed hikes,\" Slok wrote. \"[But] the negative effects of Fed hikes on corporates have been small.\"\nGordon reflected on the positives for investors.\n\"If you're in a sustained expansion where the labor market is intact, inflation expectations are well anchored, and you've got the economy growing at a pretty respectable pace, then you're in a relatively good spot,\" Gordon said.\nOn Yahoo Finance's podcast Stocks in Translation, Yahoo Finance editor Jared Blikre cuts through the market mayhem, noisy numbers, and hyperbole to bring you essential conversations and insights from across the investing landscape, providing you with the critical context needed to make the right decisions for your portfolio.

          "whole_article": "Kuehne+Nagel is pleased with how Amazon\u2019s new wholesale air cargo service is helping the world\u2019s largest freight forwarder by volume ship e-commerce packages from China to the United States, says CEO Stefan Paul.\nSwitzerland-based Kuehne+Nagel is one of Amazon Air Cargo\u2019s first outside customers. FreightWaves reported earlier this month that Amazon has begun offering third-party shippers access to its dedicated fleet of cargo jets for freight transportation. The Amazon Air Cargo website lists Apex Logistics, a K+N subsidiary based in Hong Kong, as a customer.\nAmazon\u2019s private airline helps provide expedited delivery to Prime shoppers on the retailer\u2019s website. It has sold excess cargo space to a limited number of logistics providers on a trial basis for several years. Now, Amazon Air is carrying general cargo alongside its own parcels after recently taking the concept to the full freight forwarding marketplace. The Amazon Air Cargo service is primarily available in the domestic U.S. market, where Amazon controls dozens of aircraft operated by partner airlines, as well as in Europe and India.\nK+N is using Amazon as a provider of middle- and last-mile transportation, Paul said on last week\u2019s earnings call. Apex Logistics consolidates shipments from Chinese e-commerce platforms and manufacturers and arranges transport to Hawaii on scheduled commercial flights or chartered aircraft. The shipments are transloaded at Honolulu airport to one of Amazon\u2019s new Airbus A330 converted freighters.\nAmazon has six of the widebody jets, four of which are currently in service. Hawaiian Airlines operates the A330s for Amazon on major trunk legs, including between Honolulu and Amazon\u2019s West Coast hub at San Bernardino airport in California, according to Flightradar24. The other two planes are in hangar facilities for upgrades.\n\u201cI have to say we are absolutely satisfied with the service offered by Amazon Air,\u201d K+N\u2019s CEO said. \u201cWe inject in Honolulu our e-commerce business into the Amazon air fleet business, and we leverage them for a distribution within the U.S. marketplace. This is a perfect fit. On one hand, we utilize the return flights for Amazon out of Honolulu, and on the other side, we have a direct connection into the different hubs of Amazon Air in the U.S. marketplace. So overall, I would call it a win-win situation.\u201d\nMajor transfer stations that the A330s fly to and from include JFK airport in New York and Amazon\u2019s national hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, according to flight data.\nPeak season has peaked\nK+N attributed its return to profit growth in the third quarter to shippers pulling forward international orders to avoid delays associated with a feared U.S. dockworker strike and ocean rerouting away from the dangerous Red Sea. It also lowered expectations for the current quarter because the same frontloading behavior shortened the traditional busy period for freight shipping.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe see a muted peak season this year in Q4, with most likely modest low-single-digit percentage volume growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis\u201d for air and ocean freight, in contrast with more bullish expectations at midyear, Paul said. Pre-buying has resulted in \u201cthe earlier-than-expected conclusion to the peak season,\u201d he added.\nThe logistics chief allowed for the possibility of higher fourth-quarter volumes if shippers move goods earlier than normal ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in China, which begins on Jan. 29, earlier than in recent years.\nManagement also said Red Sea rerouting was no longer causing businesses to divert shipments to faster air transport because inventory levels are stable, reducing fears of stockouts. Contributing to K+N\u2019s lukewarm peak season forecast is lower demand in the German auto sector and other industries.\nK+N is planning for global trade volumes in 2025 to grow in line with GDP, which the International Monetary Fund forecasts will grow 3.2%.\nFor the first time since the end of the pandemic, K+N\u2019s pretax earnings and profit during the third quarter increased sequentially and year over year. A new cost regime, which includes the removal of regional offices, has begun to bear fruit and also positively contributed to the bottom line.\nThe 3PL\u2019s revenue increased 18% y/y to $7.5 billion, while earnings before interest and taxes grew 2% to $525 million. But pretax earnings are down 23% year to date through September.\nK+N\u2019s air cargo business continued to benefit from tight capacity, though volume growth of 7% came in below the overall market rate of 12% on the strength of perishable goods and trans-Pacific shipping by Apex. Paul attributed the difference to lower exposure to e-commerce than that of competitors, with Apex the only part of the company handling e-commerce traffic out of China. Management said net revenue is expected to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter but remain below normal benchmarks because Apex e-commerce volumes and perishables are lower-yielding segments.\nAir forwarding operating income of $138.4 million was marginally worse than in the second quarter but a full 10% less than in 2023 due to rising costs.\nOcean volumes in the quarter grew 2% to 3.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units compared to an estimated market growth of 3% to 5%. The disparity is the result of management\u2019s decision last quarter to deselect a customer that accounted for about 140,000 TEUs of volume last year and stop serving two other large accounts in the fourth quarter of 2023 in an effort to improve revenue quality.\nK+N said it was able to convert 42% of ocean gross profit into operating income, up 7.8% from the second quarter. Average yields fell as ocean market rates fell during the third quarter. Management said it expects yields to fully normalize in the fourth quarter as the market reaches overcapacity.\nIn August, K+N completed the acquisition of the Malaysian company City Zone Express, allowing it to offer less-than-truckload services from China to major logistics centers in Southeast Asia.\nLast month, the logistics giant opened a highly automated distribution center for Adidas in northern Italy that can process up to half a million e-commerce and retail bulk shipments per day.\nSubscribe to the FreightWaves Air Cargo newsletter.\nRELATED READING:\nVendor troubles slow delivery of Amazon freighter aircraft\nAir cargo sector rides elongated peak season to strong finish\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.\nThe post Kuehne+Nagel adopts new Amazon air cargo service for China e-commerce appeared first on FreightWaves.\nView Comments"

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) are each updating investors on their financial performance over the past few months, and AI is top of mind across the board.\nAlphabet and AMD reported their results Tuesday, and while both performed well \u2014 Alphabet beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on the top and bottom lines, and AMD met expectations on revenue and beat on earnings per share \u2014 shares of the companies are heading in opposite directions, with Alphabet shares headed higher and AMD shares sliding.\nBeyond the earnings rush, there was one other big story this week: Apple\u2019s cavalcade of product announcements. The company not only released its initial batch of Apple Intelligence features through software updates for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, it also unveiled a line of new Mac laptops and desktops, as well as two new high-powered chips.\nIt\u2019s been a heck of a week so far, and we\u2019ve still got two days to go.\nEarnings take center stage\nBig Tech\u2019s earnings season feels like it\u2019s been compressed into a single week, which is both a blessing and a curse for yours truly. Sure, it gets all of the work out of the way in one shot, but it also means my keyboard is getting a heck of a workout.\nAMD CEO Lisa Su makes the opening speech at COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 3, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo) \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nGoogle parent Alphabet and AMD both provided solid results on Tuesday, but investors weren\u2019t happy with AMD\u2019s guidance for the current quarter, sending shares sliding more than 9% in early trading Wednesday. Alphabet shares, meanwhile, climbed more than 6% on the strength of its AI and cloud business growth.\nAMD said that it expects to see Q4 revenue of between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, which was just shy of expectations of $7.55 billion. That\u2019s not exactly the kind of beat and raise Wall Street has come to expect from AI chip names. Still, even at the low end of guidance, AMD\u2019s Q4 revenue would jump $1 billion versus the $6.2 billion it brought in during the same period last year.\nDespite disappointment among traders, CEO Lisa Su said there\u2019s an \u201cinsatiable demand for more computers\u201d among customers.\nAlphabet, on the other hand, is on a roll, thanks to growth in its advertising and cloud services revenue. Ad sales beat expectations, jumping from $59.6 billion a year ago to $65.8 billion in its most recent quarter, while cloud revenue increased a whopping 35%.\nBoth businesses benefit from Google\u2019s AI investments, with AI for Alphabet\u2019s cloud platform helping to draw enterprise customers and improving advertising services. But Alphabet has plenty of competition, including Microsoft, which reports after the bell on Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. There\u2019s still plenty of earnings news ahead, so stay tuned.\nStory Continues\nApple kicks off week of Mac announcements, starts big AI rollout\nApple is also having a heck of a week, with updates to its iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro lines of desktops and laptops; the debut of two new chips (the M4 Pro and M4 Max); and the rollout of its Apple Intelligence platform.\nThe new iMac gets upgraded performance via the company\u2019s M4 chip, which first debuted alongside the new iPad Pro back in May. Apple also outfitted the iMac with a new nanotexture display coating to reduce glare and the company\u2019s Center Stage camera that keeps subjects in frame during video calls.\nThe MacBook Pro is available in both 14-inch and 16-inch models. (Apple) \u00b7 Apple\nThe Mac mini, meanwhile, gets a full redesign that shrinks its footprint to 5 inches by 5 inches. Despite its smaller size, the pint-sized mini is also more powerful than its predecessor, thanks to the inclusion of Apple\u2019s M4 chip, as well as the option to upgrade to the new M4 Pro for even greater performance gains.\nThen there\u2019s the MacBook Pro, which is available with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. Apple says the Pro can also be equipped with a nanotexture display like the iMac and that it now gets up to 24 hours of battery life.\nAll of the systems are also built with Apple Intelligence in mind. Available via iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS 15.1, Apple Intelligence is the company\u2019s first major step into the generative AI space. But the company is releasing the software in stages throughout the end of this year and across 2025. The first set of capabilities won\u2019t exactly blow consumers\u2019 minds, either.\nThe platform\u2019s flashiest feature is its notification summaries for texts, news updates, and other messages.

          "whole_article": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos might not allow The Washington Post to run its traditional endorsement of a presidential candidate, but he\u2019s willing to pen and run an op-ed justifying his move. It\u2019s all in the name of keeping the media unbiased, Jeff Bezos insists.\nLast Friday, the Post announced it was not endorsing a candidate in the upcoming election, which has been deemed by some to be one of the closest in America\u2019s modern history. Sources said two Post writers produced an article that endorsed Kamala Harris, but the story was killed by Bezos, the outlet\u2019s billionaire owner.\nFacing backlash, Bezos is standing by his words. But Bezos\u2019 op-ed indicates this is a change of policy for future elections. On the topic of endorsements, he said \u201cending them is a principled decision, and it\u2019s the right one.\u201d He called his decision \u201ca meaningful step in the right direction\u201d when it comes to regaining the trust of readers amidst disillusionment with the sector in general.\nBezos defends himself, but admits some missteps\nCiting Gallup's data regarding slipping belief in institutions including the media, Bezos wrote \u201cour profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working.\u201d Despite being the owner of the Post since 2013, Bezos made his wealth and spent most of his career in the tech sector where he founded Amazon. Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n\u201cIt would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cComplaining is not a strategy.\u201d Going on to claim that \u201cpresidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\u201d Bezos said all they do is \u201ccreate a perception of bias.\u201d\nResearch from professors at Brown University shows that said endorsements are actually pretty influential \u201cin the sense that voters are more likely to support the recommended candidate after publication of the endorsement.\u201d But influence varies based on one\u2019s bias.\nEven Bezos admits the timing is a little off, as the election is only two weeks away from when the decision was announced. Calling the move \u201cinadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy,\u201d he insists there\u2019s \u201cno quid pro quo of any kind at work here.\u201d That\u2019s all despite Dave Limp, chief executive at Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin, meeting with Republican candidate Donald Trump the day of the announcement.\nBezos said he didn\u2019t know about the meeting beforehand, and implored people to trust him. Calling upon his track record at the Post, Bezos said his views are \u201cprincipled.\u201d\nStory Continues\nPerhaps this is not the job for a billionaire, concedes Bezos (though without any apparent desire to resign). \u201cWhen it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of The Post,\u201d he wrote, noting that officials at Amazon, Blue Origin, or other company he\u2019s invested in are often meeting with politicians. \u201cI once wrote that The Post is a \u2018complexifier\u2019 for me. It is, but it turns out I\u2019m also a complexifier for The Post.\u201d\nBacklash against Bezos amidst larger billionaire skepticism\nThe newspaper with the slogan \u201cdemocracy lies in darkness,\u201d has endorsed a candidate since 1976\u2014the only other time the Post declined to do so was in 1988, according to NPR. The choice to stay on the sidelines was met with some swift backlash from both internal and external figures.\nEditor-at-large Robert Kagan resigned the same day as the announcement regarding the change in endorsements, telling CNN that the policy was \u201cobviously an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with Donald Trump in the anticipation of his possible victory,\u201d as \u201cTrump has threatened to go after Bezos\u2019 business.\u201d Three out ten people on the Post\u2019s editorial board also stepped down because of the decision, while other journalists and columnists also quit in response.\nAn op-ed signed by 21 Post columnists disavows the choice as a \u201cterrible mistake,\u201d adding it \u201crepresents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love.\u201d\nBezos\u2019 choice also caused a dent in readership: As of Monday, more than 200,000 people\u2014representing around 8% of the outlet\u2019s total subscriber base\u2014canceled their subscriptions to the Post, sources told NPR.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a colossal number,\u201d former Post executive editor Marcus Brauchli told NPR of the dip in subscribers, adding there\u2019s no way to know \u201cwhy the decision was made.:\nA likely crucial element to America\u2019s distrust of the media is their growing skepticism of the rich. As wealth inequality balloons, more than half of (59%) of Americans reportedly believe billionaires create a more unfair society per Harris Poll\u2019s released survey of more than 2,100 U.S. adults.\nWhile respondents have some regard for billionaire's influence over the economy, many want them out of certain spheres. One of them is the media, as 42% of Americans don\u2019t think billionaires should be able to purchase businesses in the media sector.\nAs one of the richest people in the world, Bezos\u2019 wealth isn\u2019t just the elephant in the room; it\u2019s basically the whole room. \u201cYou can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests,\u201d he wrote in his op-ed. It seems that some Americans see it as the latter.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Photo: EPA-EFE alt=Amazon's booth at an import expo in Shanghai. Photo: EPA-EFE>\nChina's Amazon seller community has expanded rapidly in recent years, as a boom in cross-border e-commerce has driven mainland merchants and suppliers to explore opportunities abroad.\nThe import and export value of China's cross-border e-commerce industry reached 2.38 trillion yuan (US$333 billion) in 2023, up 15.6 per cent from the previous year, according to the State Council Information Office.\nThe rise of shopping platforms like Shein and Temu, both of Chinese origin, has also heated up competition in the sector, pushing Amazon to strengthen its connections with mainland sellers.\nWhile Amazon depended mostly on US sellers in the key hubs of New York, Los Angeles and Houston in its early days, \"the e-commerce landscape, particularly for Amazon sellers, has undergone a major shift in recent years, with Chinese cities now dominating the scene,\" Smartscout said.\nAmong Amazon's top 20 merchant bases, 13 are in China, including Xiamen, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, Quanzhou, Jinhua, Taiyuan, Hefei, Foshan and Wuhan.\nBrooklyn, Miami and Los Angeles are the only three US cities that made it into the top 10. Brooklyn, ranking fifth, is home to 11,815 Amazon sellers, or around 11 per cent of the Amazon merchant population in Shenzhen.\nBut while each Chinese seller carries around 1.2 brands on average, each Brooklyn seller manages around 5.9 brands, Smartscout data showed.\nStory Continues\nUS sellers \"face greater challenges in competing with the sheer volume and low production costs that Chinese sellers benefit from,\" Smartscout said.\nTo fend off competition from bargain marketplaces like Temu and Shein, which ship cheap items to global shoppers directly from China, Amazon has been planning a section on its website featuring Chinese-made, unbranded merchandise.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

A jumbo rate cut announced last month by the Federal Reserve, coupled with optimism surrounding more interest rate cuts in the coming months, have made consumers confident about the economy\u2019s health.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in discretionary stocks such as American Outdoor Brands, Inc.

You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nConsumer Confidence Soars\nThe Conference Board said on Tuesday that the consumer confidence index surged to 108.7 in October, from 99.2 in the previous month, to hit its highest level in nine months.\nThe Present Situation Index, a measure of consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, jumped 14.2 points to reach 138. \u00a0The Expectations Index, a measure of consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market situation, rose 6.3 points to 89.1. This was comfortably above the threshold of 80. Any reading below 80 indicates impending recession.\nThe jump in consumer confidence comes after ebbing drastically in September on fears of a slowing economy. Interestingly, consumer confidence remained high in October despite data suggesting a cooling job market.\nThe Labor Department said on Tuesday that job openings fell to a three-and-a-half-year low in September. Despite the decline, the Conference Board\u2019s survey showed that consumers' perceptions of the jobs market improved in October, which boosted their confidence.\nMore Rate Cut Hopes Boost Consumer Confidence\nFears gripped markets earlier this month after fresh data showed a slight uptick in monthly inflation in September. This raised concerns over the economy\u2019s health, turning markets volatile.\nHowever, consumers are hoping that inflation will still be on track to reach the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first rate cut since March 2020.\nThe Federal Reserve has also hinted that more rate cuts are on the horizon if inflation continues to ease substantially. The CME FedWatch tool presently shows a 98.9% possibility of a 25-basis point cut in November and a 76.6% probability of a 20-basis point cut in December.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 7 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best streaming and TV stocks to invest in.\nConsumer Behaviour Around Streaming Choices\nAlmost all streaming services hiked up their rates and drove subscription prices high in 2023. However, cost is not the biggest factor for consumers while they stream. As of today, the price of streaming services doesn\u2019t affect loyalty to an entertainment provider as it did in the past. Amdocs\u2019 \u201cThe New Streamer 2024\u201d report revealed that consumers are expecting improved experiences with rising costs. According to consumers, original content is the top feature that makes a subscription worthy. Other leading factors include access to older titles, new content every few weeks, and being able to watch anywhere.\nTrends Shaping the Streaming Industry\nForbes reported that streamers have been victims of long-term challenges related to profitability and subscriber growth. To counter these issues while catering to evolving consumer demands, streamers are opting for ad-supported plans. With almost half of the younger generation open to seeing more ads, this is a potential way to boost revenue.\nStreamers are also trying to score exclusive agreements and partnerships with sports leagues as live sports has become a hot commodity in streaming. Simultaneously, the cost of original content comes at reduced profitability. Against this, the potential solution is a consolidation of streaming platforms to allow access to deeper libraries of content for consumers without compromising on their priority of having original content on their plate. Additionally, cloud gaming is being integrated into streaming services considering 70% of Gen Z appears to be interested in it.\nOn October 18, Ben Silverman, Propagate Content Chairman & Co-CEO, appeared on CNBC giving examples of the aforementioned streaming industry trends. Commenting on the robust Q3 earnings for streaming giant Netflix, he said that its success would lead to more consolidation among the traditional media players in the smaller streamer space. The company is increasingly investing in original content, sports content, and gaming, something that will continue to reward the company as it expands its profits as well as businesses. While it has the money from its streaming business to make those investments back into streaming, many players in the streaming space do not have the same capabilities. Comcast also has the ability to sell a lot of WiFi and has many other businesses that can drive investment in the content business. He mentioned the telecommunications and media firm\u2019s acquisition of NBCUniversal becoming an engine for the whole company. In the views of Silverman, more troubled are the companies that are pure-play so they need to either consolidate to get to scale or be acquired by the bigger players in the future.\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, Silverman emphasized how sports acquisitions are the key drivers to advertising and not just the drivers in the ability to scale an audience at once. For instance, The streaming giant will be live-streaming two of the 2024 season\u2019s NFL games on Christmas Day. Previously in July, NBCUniversal and the NBA announced an 11-year agreement for NBC, Peacock, USA Network, Sky Sports, and Telemundo to present NBA and WNBA regular-season and playoff games starting in the 2025-26 season.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in, we sifted through ETFs, the Yahoo Finance stock screener, the Finviz stock screener, and online rankings to create an initial list of stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 7 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNetflix, Inc. (NFLX)'s Financial Growth and Future Advertising Ventures\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNumber of Hedge Fun Holders:\u00a0103\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming entertainment service with 283 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries enjoying TV series, films, and games across various genres and languages. Netflix started its journey in 1997 as a DVD-rental-by-mail firm and began streaming in the US in 2007 and internationally in 2010 while it became global in 2016.\nWith streaming entertainment replacing the linear TV experience potentially for an enduring period, Netflix expects to be one of the leading firms of the streaming entertainment era. The firm has been at a scale where it can economically create original content for Netflix since 2013 thereby reaping the benefits of originals. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a major advantage over its linear competitors as its shows don\u2019t compete for scarce prime-time slots like on linear TV. Furthermore, the reach is vast with Netflix being virtually everywhere except for Russia and China.\nIn the third quarter, revenue grew 15% year-over-year. The firm delivered multiple hits in the quarter including The Perfect Couple, Nobody Wants This, Emily in Paris, and CobraKai. Engagement remains strong with view hours per member amongst owner households increasing year-over-year through the first three quarters of 2024. Netflix is simultaneously improving its advertising business, with ads membership up 35% quarter-on-quarter and ad-tech platform set to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025.\nNetflix is well-positioned to bring engaging stories from many cultures to people globally with its global distribution. The firm is all set to benefit from the universal appeal for high-quality storytelling that transcends borders amidst the growing ubiquity of the internet. The firm remains excited about its Q4 slate including Squid Game S2, the Jake Paul/Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. With a steady drumbeat of hit titles from countries globally, healthy member engagement, and a large strong core business, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is poised for growth.\nOverall, NFLX ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of best streaming and TV stocks to invest in.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

Last week, the Tesla stock jumped about 23% primarily due to margin improvement and an upbeat outlook (read: Tesla Records its Best Day in 11 Years: 5 ETF Winners).\nDespite this surge, Wall Street remains divided over Tesla's place in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d \u2014 a group of market-dominating tech giants, including NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Microsoft MSFT and Tesla (read: Is Tesla's Stock Pop Sustainable? TSLA ETFs in Focus).\nAs the third-quarter earnings season kicks off, the Magnificent Seven is anticipated to record 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth, with NVIDIA, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta among the top contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, per FactSet, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nTesla\u2019s Earnings Rebound Yet Leave Analysts Skeptical\nTesla\u2019s third-quarter profits showed a 17% jump, a meaningful rebound after two quarters of decline. However, analysts remain cautious about Tesla\u2019s long-term position among Big Tech, citing concerns that its fundamentals may be overhyped.\nWe would like to note that Tesla\u2019s delivery numbers fell short of estimates in the past. Tesla has been losing market share to its rivals in both China and the United States, resulting in a notable slowdown in growth. This month itself we have seen Tesla\u2019s unimpressive robotaxi event, which failed to meet expectations, raising concerns among ridesharing investors.\nValuation Concerns Add to Tesla\u2019s Strained Standing\nTesla\u2019s pricey valuation further complicates its status within the Magnificent Seven. Although higher growth tends to demand a higher valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 115.54, Tesla\u2019s valuation far exceeds its tech peers.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalyst sentiment reflects this caution. Tesla currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.96 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 2.89 a month ago based on 38 recommendations.\nOf the 39 recommendations deriving the current ABR, Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 23.08% and 5.13%. It is the lowest approval rate within the Magnificent Seven.\nTesla\u2019s Stock Price Target\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 35 analysts, the average price target for Tesla comes to $206.22. The forecasts range from a low of $24.86 to a high of $310.00. The average price target represents a decline of 23.4% from the last closing price of $269.19 as on Oct. 25.\nStory Continues\nCould Netflix be a More Suitable Candidate?\nAs Tesla\u2019s standing falters, streaming giant Netflix NFLX has emerged as a possible replacement, thanks to its strong earnings, subscriber growth, improving free cash flow and solid guidance. Year to date, Netflix stock has surged by 55%, trailing only NVIDIA and Meta among the Magnificent Seven.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWealth Enhancement Group\u2019s Ayako Yoshioka believes Netflix is an appealing alternative due to its strong earnings and solid guidance. Bank of America loves its free cash flow strength, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Same is the view of Portfolio Wealth Advisors\u2019 Jesus Alvarado-Martinez.\nWith free cash flow reaching $2.19 billion in Q3, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier, Netflix\u2019s cash flow has been rising steadily since the pandemic. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich projects Netflix\u2019s free cash flow to hit $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nBroker Rating on Netflix Stock\nOf the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR of Netflix shares, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.5% and 5% of all recommendations. The Netflix stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has an upbeat VGM Score of B. Netflix shares trade at a forward P/E of 37.88X versus 105.6X forward P/E possessed by the underlying Broadcast Radio and Television.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNetflix-Heavy ETFs in Focus\nInvestors who believe that Netflix shares deserve a spot in the tech elite club may play the stock in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) form, too.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks to buy before they split next.\nS&P 500: Targeting 6,000 Amid Market Optimism\nThere\u2019s been a notable sense of fear among investors despite the market\u2019s current strong performance. The upcoming weeks are expected to be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and an impending election, alongside uncertainty regarding the Fed\u2019s next moves. But the fact remains that the market has shown resilience, with numerous new highs for major indices this year, although investors remain skeptical. Historically, volatility tends to increase after elections as political changes take effect. Currently, volatility is relatively low but is anticipated to rise as January approaches and clarity about potential policy impacts emerges.\nDespite prevailing uncertainties, there remains cautious optimism about the market\u2019s ability to maintain its upward trajectory. In mid-October, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC to the skepticism displayed by investors. We covered his sentiment in our article about the\u00a08 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now:\n\u201cKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents\u2019 experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nAround the same time, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss the market trends as well. On October 14, Mary Ann Bartels highlighted that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, she acknowledged that while this target is achievable, the journey may not be smooth.\nStory Continues\nBartels noted that there could be volatility ahead, as evidenced by increased hedging activity in the market. However, she remains optimistic due to the Fed\u2019s shift towards an easier monetary policy and the ongoing economic growth, which is supported by full employment, albeit with a slight slowdown in job creation. Importantly, she highlighted that corporate profits are on the rise, with earnings currently beating expectations by about 5%. This positive trend across fundamental and technical indicators leads her to believe that the market can continue its rally into November and December.\nAs the S&P 500 recently closed above 5,800 for the first time at 5,815, Bartels discussed how this milestone brings the 6,000 target closer. She echoed sentiments from Tom Lee, who suggested that market behavior could improve significantly if there is clarity regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Bartels agreed that once a winner is declared, it could trigger a relief rally as both domestic and foreign investors gain confidence in the stability of US leadership.\nTurning to the Fed\u2019s actions, Bartels addressed concerns about recent CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected. She described potential short-term volatility as a bucking bull, indicating that while fluctuations might occur, the overall trend remains upward. Her year-ahead thesis suggests both fixed-income and equity markets are poised for positive returns, albeit with some bumps along the way.\nBartels also advocated for buying opportunities in the current market environment. She specifically pointed to technology stocks and the NASDAQ, which has yet to hit a new record high. She believes technology will continue to lead the market, particularly emphasizing semiconductors as key drivers of growth. For investors looking to enter the tech sector, she sees this as an opportune moment.\nHer perspective underscores a belief in the resilience of corporate profits and economic fundamentals amid changing monetary policies and external uncertainties. At the same time, it should be noted that the optimistic outlook for the S&P 500 targeting 6,000 is significant for stock splits as it reflects positive market sentiment, encouraging companies to make their shares more accessible to retail investors. When share prices rise, splits can attract more buyers by lowering the price per share. However, it\u2019s important to note that a stock split does not change anything about a business\u2019s fundamentals. A poor company will stay a poor company post-split and a good company will stay a good company.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of stocks that are likely to split. We then selected the 20 stocks that have experienced the highest gains in their share prices over the past 5 years and have a history of spitting their stock. From that, we picked the top 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Netflix Inc. (NFLX) a Top Stock to Buy Before the Next Split?\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nShare Price as of October 18: $689.66\nSurge in Share Price in 5 Years: 150.51%\nStock Split Confirmed: no\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming service provider that offers TV shows, movies, documentaries, and original content. Founded in 1997 as a DVD rental service, it transitioned to a streaming platform in 2007. It has revolutionized the way people consume entertainment and is considered a pioneer in the streaming industry.\nThe company has introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier powered by AI in late 2022 to enhance user experience and deliver more effective ads. As a pioneer in online streaming, it\u2019s a top-performing stock. Its massive and growing subscriber base drives significant revenue growth. In 2023, it achieved record UK revenues, primarily due to increased subscriber numbers following its crackdown on password sharing.\nRevenue was up by 15.02% year-over-year in Q3 2024. Despite challenges in membership growth and ad monetization, it added over 5 million new subscribers and improved its operating margin to 29.6%. International markets drove subscriber growth, and the ad-supported tier saw a 35% quarter-on-quarter increase in memberships. The company\u2019s strategic shift towards advertising has solidified its position as a strong investment.\nManagement announced that the company\u2019s first-party ad server is launching in Canada this quarter and will expand to other markets in 2025. Partnerships with Trade Desk and Google Live are progressing well. There are plans for more ad formats, features, and measurement tools.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) projects a 14.7% increase in revenue year-over-year for Q4, with a target operating margin of 21.6%. Looking ahead to 2025, it anticipates annual revenue between $43 billion and $44 billion, driven by continued subscriber growth and higher average revenue per subscriber. The international expansion and ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences position it for continued growth.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFinally, we trimmed\u00a0Netflix, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:NFLX) mostly due to valuation but also as a source of funds to add to the new position in Shopify. As a reminder, we added to our position in August 2022 amid broad concerns about the company\u2019s ability to grow and monetize shared passwords. We expected Netflix to show progress in monetizing shared passwords, leading to robust free cash flow generation. This is now playing out and is appreciated by the market. Hence, given the balance of growth and valuation, we felt it was appropriate to reduce our exposure to a more normal weight.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 2nd on our list of stocks to buy before they split next. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NFLX, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

The firm's revenue estimates are 6% and 8% ahead of the consensus for those years, respectively.\nThe anticipated integration with Netflix and Roku is expected to contribute approximately 400 basis points to The Trade Desk's gross spend growth in 2025, positioning the company's revenues ahead of consensus.\nThe firm also notes that The Trade Desk is likely to continue gaining market share from Google's DV360 in the medium term due to Alphabet's legal challenges.\n\u201cIn our view, the biggest benefit from ad-tech legal challenges at Alphabet/Google is likely to be underinvestment&lack of focus, rather than pot'l business model or industry structure changes,\u201d analysts continued.\nSeparately, Citi analysts said they expect \u201canother strong beat and raise quarter\u201d from TTD, noting that key growth drivers including CTV, Retail Media, and market share gains remain intact. Moreover, there is \u201cadditional upside potential from political spend.\"\nRelated Articles\nWells Fargo starts TTD stock at Buy; Citi expects 'strong beat and raise' Q3 print\nTactical Resources files statement with SEC over planned listing via SPAC\nLucid to open orders for Gravity electric SUV next week\nView Comments"

Analysts estimated $7.55 billion on average. Though the company now expects to get more than $5 billion in sales from so-called AI accelerators this year \u2014 up from a previous forecast of $4.5 billion \u2014 some investors had been looking for a bigger bump.\nAMD is playing catch-up with Nvidia Corp. in the lucrative market for these chips, which help develop and run AI services. AMD is now generating billions of dollars from that type of product \u2014 a rapid rise from a year ago \u2014 but the level remains well short of the tens of billions of dollars that its rival is raking in.\nOn a conference call following the results, Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su pushed back on concerns that AMD isn\u2019t delivering enough growth. The company is ramping up production and earning the trust of the large data center companies that rely on AI accelerators, she said.\n\u201cWhat I will say is customers are very, very open to AMD,\u201d Su said. \u201cAnd we see that everywhere we go. Everyone is giving us a very fair shot at earning their business, and that\u2019s what we intend to do.\u201d\nAMD shares fell as much as 9% in premarket trading on Wednesday before New York exchanges opened. They were up 13% this year, closing at $166.25 in New York on Tuesday.\nAMD\u2019s third-quarter revenue rose 18% to $6.82 billion, beating an average estimate of $6.71 billion. Profit, minus certain items, increased to 92 cents a share, in line with projections.\nAMD\u2019s new MI300 accelerator products, which compete with Nvidia chips, have emerged as one of its biggest sales engines. But the growth has been hampered by the availability of supply. Like most companies in the industry, AMD no longer owns its own plants, opting instead to outsource production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\nThe company has made progress in getting more supply from its vendors, but still expects to have little latitude in terms of meeting demand if it\u2019s above current projections, Su said on the call.\nStory Continues\n\u201cI think we expect that the environment will continue to be tight, but we\u2019ve also planned for significant growth going into 2025,\u201d Su said. \u201cWe feel good about our overall supply-chain capability.\u201d\nInvestors track AMD\u2019s performance as an indicator of overall demand for AI-related hardware. Massive spending by companies such as Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS and Microsoft Corp. on this still-new type of computing infrastructure has upended the industry. The concern among investors is that AI services aren\u2019t yet big moneymakers, which may make it harder for companies to continue justifying the expense of buying the chips.\nIn addition to being Nvidia\u2019s biggest rival in AI accelerators, AMD also competes with that company in graphics chips used by computer gamers. And it goes head-to-head with Intel Corp. in personal computer and server processors.\nAMD\u2019s data-center unit had sales of $3.5 billion last quarter, more than double the total from a year earlier and slightly above estimates. PC chips brought in $1.88 billion, up 29%.\nAMD also supplies custom processors for Microsoft and Sony Group Corp. for their game consoles. That unit has seen weaker sales, hurt by the current generation of game machines nearing the end of their life cycles. Revenue fell 69% to $462 million, missing estimates.\nAMD also predicted a fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin \u2014 the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production \u2014 that was just shy of projections.\n(Updates with premarket trading in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nHow Elon Musk Came to Embrace the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the BofA's List Of AI & Semiconductor Stocks That Fund Managers Love & Hate: 16 Stocks On The Manager Radar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate.\nThe initial wave of artificial intelligence investing has shaken up the stock market. Suddenly, technology stocks are divided between those that have exposure to AI and those that don't. The former category has soared to set records while the latter has been lackluster because of the state of sluggishness in the non-AI business world.\nWithin AI stocks that have outdone themselves, semiconductor stocks are a standout. Additionally, just as is the case with broader technology stocks, semiconductor stocks are also divided between those with AI and non-AI exposure. The best example of the former category is Wall Street's top AI stock pick. This stock is of a firm that designs and sells GPUs used to process AI workloads. Its shares are up 845% since the 2023 start and have set multiple records since OpenAI's Chat GPT became publicly available.\nOn the flip side, another semiconductor stock has floundered during the same period even though it's one of the oldest and largest semiconductor companies in the world. This stock belongs to a firm that is also one of the only three companies in the world that can manufacture high-end semiconductors and it is the only one which is headquartered in the US. While the GPU designer's shares have gained 845%, over the same time, this semiconductor stock is down 13.9%, and year to date the shares have bled an unbelievable 53.14%.\nTherein lies the bifurcation between semiconductor stocks that is fueled by the artificial intelligence wave. However, these returns might belong to the first stage of AI stocks only, implying that other semiconductor companies could also see gains provided robust AI software demand and the ability of firms to monetize their products.\u00a0 We covered a lot of such potential stocks as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks.\nIn this list, there were five semiconductor stocks. Four of these are semiconductor manufacturers while the remaining stock is the firm whose designs are the backbone of the modern-day smartphone industry. The stocks are ranked 19th, 16th, 14th, 8th, and 6th. Looking at their year-to-date performance, these stocks are up roughly 45%, 51.7%, 65.7%, 97.8%, and 122% year-to-date, respectively. Safe to say, the AI wave has been kind to these stocks. The next step in our brief analysis is to see what analysts believe the future holds for these firms. To do this, one particularly useful ratio is the forward price to earnings since it gauges the current price to analyst estimates of future earnings.\nStory Continues\nFor these five phase two AI semiconductor stocks, the forward P/E ratios in respective orders are roughly 31.25, 50.51, 29.41, 25.19, and 99 times. The forward P/E ratio for global and US semiconductor stocks is 45.77 so most of these stocks are fairly valued. Consequently, this implies that in case of an AI correction that sees investor sentiment evaporate for any reason, these stocks might not be hit as hard as those speculating about an 'AI bubble' might worry, but if Wall Street finds more reasons to add to its AI euphoria, then their valuation might further bloom for more gains.\nShifting gears, the average forward P/E ratio for the semiconductor industry also leads us to wonder which stocks are driving this average value higher. After all, the six AI chip stocks we've covered above include some of the biggest companies in the world. However, high P/E ratios commonly belong to smaller companies that earn small profits but have a much higher share price. Two stocks that we've identified that have at least 2x the average forward P/E ratio are both unprofitable right now. The one with the higher forward P/E ratio of 196.08 ranks 20th on our list of Piper Sandler\u2019s Top Technical Stock Picks: 20 Best Stocks while the second with a beefy ratio of 133.33 ranked 32nd on this list of AI stocks that were recently trending.\nSo, the next question to ask is, what makes these stocks so special that despite the fact that neither is currently profitable, investors have valued their shares more than 100 times over their projected earnings? Well, starting from the first stock with the higher P/E ratio, this firm is one of the few hardened integrated circuit manufacturers in the US. It makes radiation-resistant chips for the US military and its tools enable chip designs at various nodes. The second stock, which is up 49% year to date, is a specialty chip manufacturer that makes and sells silicon-based timing devices as an alternative to quartz-based products. These are used in applications such as edge computing and 5G networks - systems that are closer to end users and therefore must endure more strenuous working environments.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of semiconductor stocks that fund managers love and hate according to BofA, we used its recent list of semiconductor stocks that were popular or losing popularity with fund managers. The list was divided into two sections based on expansion or decline in ownership.\u00a0 Stocks within each category were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. For an interesting exercise, you can also compare these stocks with those on our lists of Goldman Sachs\u2019 List Of Stocks That Hedge & Mutual Funds Love & Hate: 28 Stocks On The Mutual and Hedge Funds Radar.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 179\nSection: Gaining Popularity\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading AI GPU designer and also the GPU design stock that we covered in our introduction. Its GPUs are used for AI workloads, in data centers, for gaming, professional rendering, cars, and in consoles. This provides NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a strong presence in the GPU industry and makes it the market leader in terms of performance and market share. The firm also benefits from its CUDA software which enhances the control that users can exercise over their hardware. Additionally, it also means that even if AI spending slows down, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) can capitalize on data centers shifting to accelerated computing. CEO Jensen Huang believes that limitations in chip fabrication have necessitated the use of GPUs as accelerated computing products, which opens up a trillion-dollar market for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Yet, the firm could see headwinds if there is a glut in the industry or if the trend of custom AI chips grows.\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cMore recently, however, we\u2019ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA\u2019s stock move today with Cisco\u2019s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we\u2019ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA\u2019s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows\u2013 not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA\u2019s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco\u2019s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 20 days ago when the stock dropped 5.1% on the news that the company announced new data center AI chips (AMD Instinct MI325X Accelerators), barely a day after executives of rival Nvidia announced to Wall Street analysts that the Blackwell GPU (designed for AI workloads) products are \"booked out 12 months.\"\nAlso, AMD's new AI chip won't begin shipping until the first quarter of 2025. AMD's CEO Lisa Su touts her company\u2019s new platform as superior to Nvidia's Blackwell when specific inference benchmarks are used.\nAMD is up 7.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $149.47 per share, it is still trading 29.3% below its 52-week high of $211.38 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,512.\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right.

The Nasdaq Composite posted a new all-time high on Friday, its first since July.\nThe group is expected to report a +16.9% increase in Q3 earnings relative to the same period last year, alongside a +13.3% rise in revenues, according to Zacks Earnings Trends. These stocks have shown divergent performance in 2024, with NVIDIA NVDA and Meta META leading the pack and Tesla TSLA lagging far behind.\nMicrosoft, MSFT, Alphabet GOOG, Amazon AMZN and Meta increased their capital spending to $106.2 billion during the first half of this year, up 49% from the same period a year ago, per WSJ.\nThey are not expected to slow down on spending as the AI race heats up. However, investors are closely watching to see if earnings growth will justify this significant capital outlay on AI.\nNVIDIA will report its earnings next month, but big tech results this week could drive its shares higher since a significant portion of capital spending is directed toward its AI chips.\nThe Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF QQQM, a cheaper version of the popular QQQ ETF QQQ, offers one of the best ways to gain exposure to mega-cap tech giants. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS provides equal-weighted exposure to the \"Magnificent 7.\"\nSingle-stock ETFs like the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF NVDL can be effectively used as short-term tactical trading tools by high-conviction traders, especially since these stocks could see big moves this week.

          "whole_article": "Investors might want to bet on Nvidia (NVDA), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Nvidia is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\nFor Nvidia, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\nStory Continues\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Nvidia\nFor the fiscal year ending January 2025, this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to earn $2.82 per share, which is a change of 116.9% from the year-ago reported number.\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Nvidia. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4.7%.\nBottom Line\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\nThe upgrade of Nvidia to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Looking to 2025, Google said capex will again increase but not at the same level.\nOf course, much of this increase in capex spending is due to the company's AI investment, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is thought to be getting a large chunk of the increased budget.\nGoogle confirmed on its conference call that much of the capex spending is going to its technical infrastructure. The largest component is investment in servers, followed by data centers and networking equipment, the company said.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is \u201cwell positioned because in our AI infrastructure\u2026 [w]e have all the leading AI accelerators, GPUs, TPUs, as well as CPUs, and we are investing in all of them.\u201d\nSpeaking about its relationship with NVIDIA, Pichai said they have a \u201cwonderful partnership\u201d with the AI giant, and they are \u201cexcited for the GB200s, and we will be one of the first to provide it at scale.\u201d\nGB200 refers to NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell AI Superchips and servers, which will start shipping in the current quarter.\nAnalysts at ItauBBA view the Google earnings capex update as neutral and within market expectations. However, they are still making a tactical buy call on NVIDIA ahead of earnings from the company's other large partners - Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which are both set to report earnings Wednesday after the close.\nThe analyst highlights that while META has postponed its annual capex/opex guidance to Q4 2024 instead of the usual third quarter, it will likely prepare the market for higher numbers in stages, which could hint at a bullish stance for NVDA. Meanwhile, MSFT may face quarterly capex volatility due to Blackwell delays, but is expected to take a conservative approach in guiding its investment plans. If either of these scenarios unfolds, NVDA could potentially outperform, they said.\nRelated Articles\nGoogle's capex spending is growing 60%, which is good news for NVIDIA\nUBS profit surges above forecasts, hazy capital outlook weighs on shares\nStocks slip as investors weigh US election risk, earnings\nView Comments"

Profit rose to $3.30 a share. Analysts on average estimated sales of $64.5 billion and per-share earnings of $3.11, according to Bloomberg data.\nThe Azure cloud computing division posted a 34% revenue gain in the quarter, adjusted for currency fluctuations. That decelerated slightly from the 35% growth in the previous period but was ahead of Microsoft\u2019s earlier forecast, according to some analysts.\nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has overhauled the software maker\u2019s product line with AI models from partner OpenAI. He\u2019s now seeking to recruit enough paying customers to the souped-up software and services to drive Microsoft\u2019s growth for years to come. At the same time, corporations are tapping the company\u2019s data-center capacity to power development of their own AI applications, buoying demand in its closely watched its Azure business.\n\u201cPeople are shifting from just talking about artificial intelligence and testing and piloting artificial intelligence to actually putting it into production,\u201d said Jackson Ader, an analyst at Keybanc.\nMicrosoft shares gained about 1% in extended trading following the report.

The stock fell 3.7% in the quarter compared with a 5.5% increase in the Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index, reflecting Wall Street concerns that Microsoft isn\u2019t yet realizing sufficient gains from its AI investments, and may risk falling behind as rivals pile into the market.\nAI Contribution\nThe company\u2019s main sources of AI-related income fall into two categories \u2014 cloud services and AI-enhanced productivity assistants baked into Office, which help workers summarize emails, transcribe conference calls and create slideshows. The company said 12 percentage points of Azure\u2019s growth was attributable to AI, compared with 11 points in the June quarter.\nMicrosoft\u2019s overall cloud revenue, a mix of sales from products such as Office and Azure cloud sales, rose 22% to $38.9 billion.\nStory Continues\nThe results come a day after Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google posted quarterly cloud sales that grew more than analysts had projected, rising to $11.4 billion, a 35% increase from the year-earlier period.\nLike Amazon.com Inc. and Google, Microsoft has ramped up spending to construct and rent the data centers required to fuel power-hungry AI services. Capital expenditures, closely watched by investors as Microsoft embarks on this historic build-out, jumped to $55.7 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30.

          "whole_article": "Reddit (RDDT) is wearing its new popularity well.\nShares of the social media platform exploded over 40% on Tuesday following the company's first-ever profitable quarter.\n\"I think we're hitting a kind of an era of mainstream for Reddit,\" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance (video above). \"We finally made the product easy enough to use that we're hitting this tier of mainstream-ness.\"\nReddit's global daily active users increased 47% year over year to 97.2 million. Weekly global active unique users rose 53% from the prior year.\nTotal revenue improved 68% to $348.4 million due mostly to strength in advertising as clients grew more comfortable putting dollars toward the controversial site. Analysts had expected sales of $314 million. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $94.1 million versus a $6.9 million loss a year ago.\nEarnings per share of $0.16 marked a reversal from a $0.13 loss last year. The Street was modeling for a loss of $0.07.\n\u2022 USD\n(RDDT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nFor Reddit, the third quarter was another win for 2024.\nInitially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, the company ended up pricing at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation. The targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion it fetched in a 2021 funding round.\nThe stock began trading at $47 per share and quickly shot past $53.\nShares finished their first day of trading on March 21 at $50.44.\nThe stock currently trades at around $112. Reddit's market cap is now roughly $18.6 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nThis option is unavailable due to your privacy preferences. Please update your privacy settings to enable it.\nThe company was the first major social media IPO since Pinterest (PINS) debuted in 2019.\nReddit's IPO came on the heels of a licensing deal with Google to use its data to train large language models. In May, Reddit entered a similar deal with OpenAI.\n\"We think Reddit has multiple avenues to drive impressions and pricing higher over time, which contributes to an impressive growth profile for advertising revenue. Reddit has an attractive call option from data licensing, which provides high-margin ancillary revenue,\" said Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni following the company's third quarter earnings release.\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

Its EPS of $3.30 per share was also 6.2% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy Microsoft? Find out in our full research report.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Q3 CY2024 Highlights:\nNOTE THAT MSFT HAS CHANGED THE WAY IT REPORTS SEGMENTS, MAKING FOR SOME WEIRD COMPARISONS; FOR THIS QUARTER, WE URGE INVESTORS TO PAY ATTENTION MORE TO CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nRevenue: $65.59 billion vs analyst estimates of $64.56 billion (1.6% beat)\nOperating Profit (GAAP): $30.55 billion vs analyst estimates of $29.2 billion (4.6% beat)\nEPS (GAAP): $3.30 vs analyst estimates of $3.11 (6.2% beat)\nGross Margin: 69.4%, down from 71.2% in the same quarter last year\nOperating Margin: 46.6%, down from 47.6% in the same quarter last year\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 29.4%, down from 36.6% in the same quarter last year\nMarket Capitalization: $3.21 trillion\nKey Topics & Areas Of Debate\nAI is probably the hottest topic in the world of investing today, and the debate for Microsoft is simple. How big is the AI benefit, when will we see it flow into revenue, and how much will it cost from an operating expense and capital expenditure perspective?\nCustomers who pay for Microsoft's products and services to enable their own GenAI goals will likely be buying infrastructure, developer tools, and data analytics platforms. Azure sits at the center of Microsoft\u2019s AI ambitions, and it allows enterprise customers to do everything from accessing large language models (LLMs) to analyzing large volumes of data in real-time.\nAside from Azure, Copilot is a suite of AI-powered integrations into various Microsoft products to enhance productivity and streamline tasks. Microsoft 365 Copilot automates writing in Word, modeling in Excel, and email management in Outlook while GitHub Copilot, developed via a collaboration with OpenAI, automates code completion.\nDespite its scale, Microsoft doesn\u2019t operate in a vacuum. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) competes against Azure with Google Cloud Platform and in productivity tools with G Suite and Google Workspace. Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) macOS operating system also goes head to head against Microsoft\u2019s Windows, and its iPhone and iPad products have been a thorn in its side. Lastly, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (XTRA:SAP), and many others compete with at least some subset of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio.\nRevenue Growth\nMicrosoft proves that huge, scaled companies can still grow quickly. The company\u2019s revenue base of $129.8 billion five years ago has nearly doubled to $254.2 billion in the last year, translating into an exceptional 14.4% annualized growth rate.\nStory Continues\nOver the same period, Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple put up revenue growth rates of 19.1%, 17%, and 8.3%, respectively. Comparing the four is relevant because investors often pit them against each other to derive their valuations. With these benchmarks in mind, we think Microsoft is a bit on the expensive side but still worth owning.\nQuarterly Revenue of Megacap Tech Companies\nWe at StockStory emphasize long-term growth, but for megacap tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss the impact of emerging trends like AI. Microsoft\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 11.9% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were good and suggest demand was strong.\nMicrosoft Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\nThis quarter, Microsoft reported year-on-year revenue growth of 16%, and its $65.59 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.6%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 13% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is admirable for a company of its scale and illustrates the market sees it as a beneficiary of the AI trend rather than a victim.\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\nIntelligent Cloud: Azure & Cloud Computing\nThe most pressing question about Microsoft\u2019s business is how big of a benefit AI will be for revenues. The company's cloud computing division, Intelligent Cloud, is one we carefully watch because its Azure platform and server and database offerings could be the biggest beneficiaries of the AI megatrend.\nIntelligent Cloud is the most sizeable chunk of Microsoft\u2019s revenue at 41.4% of total sales and grew at a 20.6% annualized rate over the last five years, faster than its consolidated revenues. The previous two years saw deceleration as it grew 15.7% annually, though this isn\u2019t a bad thing since it\u2019s still expanding quickly.\nMicrosoft Intelligent Cloud Quarterly Revenue\nIntelligent Cloud\u2019s flat revenue fell short of expectations in Q3, missing Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 16.8%.\u00a0However, note that the company changed the way it reports segments, starting with this quarter. It seems like not all Wall Street analysts were correctly capturing this dynamic, leading to a large miss that seems artificial.\nYear-On-Year Revenue Growth of Hyperscaler Cloud Vendors\nIn terms of market share, Azure is a close second as its run-rate revenue (current quarter\u2019s sales times four) is around $80 billion versus roughly $100 billion and $45 billion for AWS and Google Cloud. If Azure wants to catch up to AWS in the coming years, growth will have to accelerate beyond its current levels.\nKey Takeaways from Microsoft\u2019s Q3 Results\nIt was good to see Microsoft top analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. We were also excited its operating income outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. Note that changes in how the company reports segments led to large segment beats and misses that are a bit artificial to us. The stock remained flat at $435.72 immediately following the results.\nMicrosoft put up rock-solid earnings, but one quarter doesn\u2019t necessarily make the stock a buy. Let\u2019s see if this is a good investment.The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free.\nView Comments"

The segment also posted a loss of $4.4 billion versus the $4.6 billion analysts had anticipated.\nMeta\u2019s AI strategy includes rolling out its Llama family of models across its consumer offerings and advertiser products.

The device, which is still in early development, is meant to serve as a pair of glasses that allow you to speak with other users via holograms projected onto the real world.\nStory Continues\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shows off a prototype of the company's Orion augmented reality glasses at Meta Connect in October.

          "whole_article": "What Happened?\nShares of online advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) jumped 7% in the morning session after the company reported third-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' revenue, operating income, and EPS expectations. The segments themselves were also all solid, with Search, YouTube, and Cloud all exceeding revenue estimates. Leading the pack was the cloud segment, which grew 35% year on year. Up next was YouTube, with combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassing $50 billion.\nTo top it off, the company continued to demonstrate new ways to innovate in the Search business, its primary cash cow. First, AI Overviews (like generative AI for Google Search) are being rolled out in 100 countries, reaching more than 1 billion users monthly. Second, Circle to Search, which makes it as easy as pinching your screen to search for an image or video, is also available on over 150 million Android devices.\nLastly, the company continued to make significant progress in other bets that can expand its addressable market and create new monetizable opportunities. Weekly, Waymo reached 1 million fully autonomous miles and serves over 150,000 paid rides, the first among autonomous vehicle companies. These updates are closely watched and anticipated by analysts, as they often earmark significant progress toward the mass adoption and monetization of autonomous vehicles.\nMoving to the bottom line, operating profit at the segments also beat. Interestingly, GOOGL noted that 25% of new code generated at the company is powered by AI, indicating the potential efficiency that can be delivered internally and to customers.

In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock dropped 2.5% on the news that the Department of Justice is reportedly exploring a breakup of the Google division along with other options. According to a government court filing, \"That would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features \u2014 including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence \u2014 over rivals or new entrants.\"\nStory Continues\nThis follows a federal judge ruling in August 2024 that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws. Google responded in a blog post, \"We believe that today's blueprint goes well beyond the legal scope of the Court's decision about Search distribution contracts. Government overreach in a fast-moving industry may have negative unintended consequences for American innovation and America's consumers. We look forward to making our arguments in court.\"\nAlphabet is up 28% since the beginning of the year, and at $176.87 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $191.18 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Alphabet\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,806.\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\nView Comments"

Profit rose to $3.30 a share. Analysts on average estimated sales of $64.5 billion and per-share earnings of $3.11, according to Bloomberg data.\nThe Azure cloud computing division posted a 34% revenue gain in the quarter, adjusted for currency fluctuations. That decelerated slightly from the 35% growth in the previous period but was ahead of Microsoft\u2019s earlier forecast, according to some analysts.\nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has overhauled the software maker\u2019s product line with AI models from partner OpenAI. He\u2019s now seeking to recruit enough paying customers to the souped-up software and services to drive Microsoft\u2019s growth for years to come. At the same time, corporations are tapping the company\u2019s data-center capacity to power development of their own AI applications, buoying demand in its closely watched Azure business.\n\u201cPeople are shifting from just talking about artificial intelligence and testing and piloting artificial intelligence to actually putting it into production,\u201d said Jackson Ader, an analyst at Keybanc.\nMicrosoft shares gained about 1% in extended trading following the report. They had closed up less than 1% to $423.53 in New York. The stock fell 3.7% in the quarter compared with a 5.5% increase in the Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index, reflecting Wall Street concerns that Microsoft isn\u2019t yet realizing sufficient gains from its AI investments, and may risk falling behind as rivals pile into the market.\nAI Contribution\nThe company\u2019s main sources of AI-related income fall into two categories \u2014 cloud services and AI-enhanced productivity assistants baked into Office, which help workers summarize emails, transcribe conference calls and create slideshows. The company said 12 percentage points of Azure\u2019s growth was attributable to AI, compared with 11 points in the June quarter.\nMicrosoft\u2019s overall cloud revenue, a mix of sales from products such as Office and Azure cloud sales, rose 22% to $38.9 billion.\nStory Continues\nThe results come a day after Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google posted quarterly cloud sales that grew more than analysts had projected, rising to $11.4 billion, a 35% increase from the year-earlier period.\nLike Amazon.com Inc. and Google, Microsoft has ramped up spending to construct and rent the data centers required to fuel power-hungry AI services. Capital expenditures, closely watched by investors as Microsoft embarks on this historic build-out, jumped to $55.7 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30. The company has forecast a further increase in the current year. Microsoft\u2019s AI electricity needs are so significant it struck a deal to purchase nuclear power from a restarted reactor at Three Mile Island.\nIn July, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood forecast that Azure growth would continue to slow in the September quarter, but said investments in data centers would let the company capitalize on demand and accelerate Azure growth in the second half of fiscal 2025.\nMicrosoft has been signing up corporate clients to use its AI-infused Office services, which carry a monthly list price of $30 per user, in addition to the cost of the basic Office product. Because of that expense, and because the products are still at an early stage of readiness, some clients have moved slowly with trials and deployments.\n(Updated with context throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nHow Elon Musk Came to Embrace the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Microsoft and the computer makers that run its Windows operating system this year unveiled a new class of AI-imbued laptops as the company confronts heightened competition from Big Tech rivals in pitching generative AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home.\nBuilding and operating AI systems is costly and Microsoft reported spending $20 billion over the quarter, mostly for its cloud computing and AI needs.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella in a statement Wednesday emphasized the company\u2019s push to get customers applying AI platforms in their workplaces as AI transforms jobs and work tasks.\nNadella, now in his tenth year as CEO, saw his annual compensation increase 63% this year to $79 million, according to a statement filed ahead of Microsoft\u2019s upcoming annual shareholder meeting in December.

Its EPS of $3.30 per share was also 6.2% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy Microsoft? Find out in our full research report.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Q3 CY2024 Highlights:\nNOTE THAT MSFT HAS CHANGED THE WAY IT REPORTS SEGMENTS, MAKING FOR SOME WEIRD COMPARISONS; FOR THIS QUARTER, WE URGE INVESTORS TO PAY ATTENTION MORE TO CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nRevenue: $65.59 billion vs analyst estimates of $64.56 billion (1.6% beat)\nOperating Profit (GAAP): $30.55 billion vs analyst estimates of $29.2 billion (4.6% beat)\nEPS (GAAP): $3.30 vs analyst estimates of $3.11 (6.2% beat)\nGross Margin: 69.4%, down from 71.2% in the same quarter last year\nOperating Margin: 46.6%, down from 47.6% in the same quarter last year\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 29.4%, down from 36.6% in the same quarter last year\nMarket Capitalization: $3.21 trillion\nKey Topics & Areas Of Debate\nAI is probably the hottest topic in the world of investing today, and the debate for Microsoft is simple. How big is the AI benefit, when will we see it flow into revenue, and how much will it cost from an operating expense and capital expenditure perspective?\nCustomers who pay for Microsoft's products and services to enable their own GenAI goals will likely be buying infrastructure, developer tools, and data analytics platforms. Azure sits at the center of Microsoft\u2019s AI ambitions, and it allows enterprise customers to do everything from accessing large language models (LLMs) to analyzing large volumes of data in real-time.\nAside from Azure, Copilot is a suite of AI-powered integrations into various Microsoft products to enhance productivity and streamline tasks. Microsoft 365 Copilot automates writing in Word, modeling in Excel, and email management in Outlook while GitHub Copilot, developed via a collaboration with OpenAI, automates code completion.\nDespite its scale, Microsoft doesn\u2019t operate in a vacuum. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) competes against Azure with Google Cloud Platform and in productivity tools with G Suite and Google Workspace. Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) macOS operating system also goes head to head against Microsoft\u2019s Windows, and its iPhone and iPad products have been a thorn in its side. Lastly, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (XTRA:SAP), and many others compete with at least some subset of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio.\nRevenue Growth\nMicrosoft proves that huge, scaled companies can still grow quickly. The company\u2019s revenue base of $129.8 billion five years ago has nearly doubled to $254.2 billion in the last year, translating into an exceptional 14.4% annualized growth rate.\nStory Continues\nOver the same period, Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple put up revenue growth rates of 19.1%, 17%, and 8.3%, respectively. Comparing the four is relevant because investors often pit them against each other to derive their valuations. With these benchmarks in mind, we think Microsoft is a bit on the expensive side but still worth owning.\nQuarterly Revenue of Megacap Tech Companies\nWe at StockStory emphasize long-term growth, but for megacap tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss the impact of emerging trends like AI. Microsoft\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 11.9% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were good and suggest demand was strong.\nMicrosoft Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\nThis quarter, Microsoft reported year-on-year revenue growth of 16%, and its $65.59 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.6%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 13% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is admirable for a company of its scale and illustrates the market sees it as a beneficiary of the AI trend rather than a victim.\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\nIntelligent Cloud: Azure & Cloud Computing\nThe most pressing question about Microsoft\u2019s business is how big of a benefit AI will be for revenues. The company's cloud computing division, Intelligent Cloud, is one we carefully watch because its Azure platform and server and database offerings could be the biggest beneficiaries of the AI megatrend.\nIntelligent Cloud is the most sizeable chunk of Microsoft\u2019s revenue at 41.4% of total sales and grew at a 20.6% annualized rate over the last five years, faster than its consolidated revenues. The previous two years saw deceleration as it grew 15.7% annually, though this isn\u2019t a bad thing since it\u2019s still expanding quickly.\nMicrosoft Intelligent Cloud Quarterly Revenue\nIntelligent Cloud\u2019s flat revenue fell short of expectations in Q3, missing Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 16.8%.\u00a0However, note that the company changed the way it reports segments, starting with this quarter. It seems like not all Wall Street analysts were correctly capturing this dynamic, leading to a large miss that seems artificial.\nYear-On-Year Revenue Growth of Hyperscaler Cloud Vendors\nIn terms of market share, Azure is a close second as its run-rate revenue (current quarter\u2019s sales times four) is around $80 billion versus roughly $100 billion and $45 billion for AWS and Google Cloud. If Azure wants to catch up to AWS in the coming years, growth will have to accelerate beyond its current levels.\nKey Takeaways from Microsoft\u2019s Q3 Results\nIt was good to see Microsoft top analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. We were also excited its operating income outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. Note that changes in how the company reports segments led to large segment beats and misses that are a bit artificial to us. The stock remained flat at $435.72 immediately following the results.\nMicrosoft put up rock-solid earnings, but one quarter doesn\u2019t necessarily make the stock a buy. Let\u2019s see if this is a good investment.The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free.\nView Comments"

Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\"\nFor the third quarter, Meta saw earnings per share (EPS) of $6.03 on revenue of $40.5 billion. Wall Street was expecting EPS of $5.25 on revenue of $40.2 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company saw EPS of $4.50 and revenue of $34.1 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAdvertising revenue came in at $39.8 billion versus expectations of $39.7 billion, while Meta\u2019s Reality Labs segment, which includes sales of its Quest augmented reality line of headsets, saw revenue of $270 million. Analysts were expecting the business to generate $312 million. The segment also posted a loss of $4.4 billion versus the $4.6 billion analysts had anticipated.\nThe social media giant has quickly become an artificial intelligence power in its own right, up there with the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), and investors are on board for the ride.\nMeta\u2019s AI strategy includes rolling out its Llama family of models across its consumer offerings and advertiser products. It\u2019s also offering the platform as open-source software. To that end, Meta reported that organizations ranging from Accenture (ACN) and DoorDash (DASH) to Goldman Sachs (GS) are using Llama to develop their own AI software.\nMeta\u2019s earnings follow a report by the Information that the company is working on its own search functionality for its Meta AI service that will allow users to ask questions and get answers about current events. The goal is to ensure Meta will no longer have to rely on Google's or Microsoft\u2019s search engines to answer certain user queries.\nStory Continues\nThe company is also coming off of a successful Meta Connect conference, during which it debuted a working prototype of its Orion augmented reality glasses. The device, which is still in early development, is meant to serve as a pair of glasses that allow you to speak with other users via holograms projected onto the real world.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shows off a prototype of the company's Orion augmented reality glasses at Meta Connect in October. (Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) \u00b7 picture alliance via Getty Images\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg and company also talked up the success of Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which are growing in popularity, and debuted the Quest 3S entry-level augmented reality headset.\nBut all of that AI and hardware development costs some serious cash. Meta reported $9.2 billion in capital expenditures in the quarter.\nBeyond spending concerns, Meta is also facing a host of high-profile legal challenges, including an FTC antitrust lawsuit alleging the company acts as an illegal monopoly, as well as lawsuits claiming Meta is harmful to teens' mental health.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks on the list of crowded software short positions.\nWith the close of 2024 approaching fast, artificial intelligence continues to set the narrative on Wall Street. The tail end of October marks the start of another highly anticipated earnings season, which for the most part, will continue to be dominated by AI. On the hardware front, investors will be on the lookout for whether the demand for AI GPUs is sustaining and if the firm that is the market leader is also improving its margins and profitability. For software stocks, investors will pour over profitability data to determine whether the billions of dollars invested in training and testing AI as well as in business partnerships are yielding results.\nFor software stocks, their exposure to AI is so strong that it has divided the 2024 stock performance of some firms into neat halves determined by investor sentiment about their AI products. One such AI software stock ranked 5th on our recent list of AI stocks that insiders are selling. Looking at its year-to-date share price performance, it\u2019s rather neatly divided into two halves that converge on June 13th. Year to date on June 13th, the shares were down 19.8% even though the firm\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenue was a cool $19.4 billion and had grown by 10% annually. Before that eventful day, the firm\u2019s first quarter had seen it grow revenue by 11% annually but struggle to keep costs low and profit margins high.\nYet, the investor bearishness surrounding this well-known provider of productivity software tools such as Photoshop and Reader, would change in the blink of an eye. From June 13th to the third week of October, the shares have reversed course and gained 8.5%. In fact, between the 13th and September 12th, the stock had gained 27.9%. June 13th was the day that this firm reported its second-quarter earnings. The results led to its shares jumping by 13% in aftermarket trading, with investors impressed by the fact that the firm increased full-year guidance to range between $21.40 billion and $21.50 billion from an earlier $21.30 billion $21.50 billion.\nThe optimism was driven in part by the firm\u2019s Creative Cloud business which includes products such as Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, and Express. The AI addition to Creative Cloud was the firm\u2019s set of generative AI models dubbed Firefly. Management shared that Firefly was at the heart of the ARR guidance bump to $1.95 billion as they shared:\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the Digital Media business and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services and Express. We\u2019re pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half.\u201d\nWith AI profitability driving the second-quarter earnings season, investors were naturally ecstatic and sent the stock higher.\nHowever, the June respite would be short-lived as the shares tanked by 13.4% in September. As usual, AI was the culprit. The downward trend started in the form of a 9.2% drop in after-market following the firm\u2019s third-quarter report. It saw the company guide Q4 revenue at a midpoint of $5.525 billion which fell below the $5.61 billion analyst consensus.\nWhile this firm is a consumer and professional software stock, the broader software as a service (SaaS) industry hasn\u2019t been spared by the AI-driven Wall Street trends either. SaaS and software stocks are predominantly valued through two metrics: the Rule of 40 and EV/Sales (or variants such as EV/EBITDA or Price to Sales). These multiples are somewhat unique to the software and SaaS stock narrative as they evaluate the firms based on their ability to grow. This is key since one of the main reasons behind SaaS stock popularity is that they do not have to deal with inventory, logistics, or supply chain issues like other businesses.\nIn the AI era, SaaS valuation multiples and revenue growth estimates have been severely compressed. Data shows that the median price to forward sales SaaS multiple is 5.5x right now. The valuations are driven by lower growth expectations. After AI and the decimation ushered in by high interest rates, just 1% of SaaS and software companies have a 12-month future revenue growth rate higher than 30% as of June 2024. Digging deeper, investors have also placed a higher premium on growth as while firms with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 have a median EV/Sales multiple of 8.9x, those with a growth rate greater than 30% but a Rule of 40 score lesser than 40 have a median multiple of 11.6x.\nThese AI-driven software shifts, precipitated by worries of a reduction in SaaS demand due to businesses self-developing software using AI have also affected investor sentiment. According to Jefferies\u2019 latest Trading Positioning Survey, 19% of institutional investors were overweight on software stocks as of October 2024, a sharp drop over July\u2019s reading of 28% and January\u2019s 51%. Yet, investors have also tempered their short positions as Jefferies shows that 54 software stocks were shorted as of October compared to 73 in July.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software short positions, we ranked the top nine crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a well-known cybersecurity software provider that rose to fame earlier this year after its faulty software update led to an unbelievable 8.5 million computers going offline worldwide. The outage also flipped the firm\u2019s narrative, as the shares lost more than 42% of their value over the next two weeks. However, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has managed to control some of the damage from the outage as its shares are up 24.9% year to date and 41.6% since the post-outage bottom. Part of the recovery is based on easing investor worries of customer loss as CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) might be able to prevent fallout due to high switching costs. Investors will nevertheless be on the watchout for customers jumping ship, and they will also monitor CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s fiscal 2031 recurring revenue guidance of $10 billion and midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of crowded software shorts according to Jefferies. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $982.26 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25%. The $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +27.5% and +22.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

As for the firm, it is still targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by its fiscal year 2031 and a midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%.

Delta did not immediately comment on CrowdStrike's suit.\nCrowdStrike is seeking a declaratory judgment plus legal fees.\nDelta's lawsuit filed on Friday in Fulton County Superior Court called the faulty software update from CrowdStrike \"catastrophic\" and said the company \"forced untested and faulty updates to its customers, causing more than 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to crash.\"\nDelta said the faulty update caused 7,000 flight cancellations, disrupted travel plans of 1.3 million customers and cost the carrier more than $500 million.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit, also filed on Friday, said Delta's own response and technology caused delays in the carrier's ability to resume normal operations.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit reiterated its contention that it has minimal liability, something Delta rejected.\nDelta said CrowdStrike is liable for over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses as well as for unspecified lost profits, expenditures - including legal fees - reputational harm and future revenue loss.\nThe incident prompted the U.S. Transportation Department to open an investigation.\n\"If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed,\" Delta's lawsuit says.\nDelta said it has invested billions of dollars in information technology licensing and infrastructure.\nLast month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologized before Congress for the faulty software update.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nIn a recent Tech Check program, CNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI\u2019s head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries.\nAs reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide \u201cmathematically precise and reproducible answers\u201d by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations.\n\u201cThink of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data \u2014 cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result\u201d.\nDespite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly \u201challucinating\u201d. OpenAI may deem it to have near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy\u201d, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments. A University of Michigan researcher found hallucinations in 80% of the audio transcriptions he examined during a study of public meetings.\nStory Continues\nSuch mistakes could have \u201creally grave consequences,\u201d particularly in hospital settings\u2026Nobody wants a misdiagnosis\u201d and that \u201cThere should be a higher bar.\u201d\nWith that, let's look at the 15 recent AI news that nobody should miss.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a global cybersecurity company offering cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data. It employs world-class AI and ML to detect and prevent modern threats with the speed and scale of the cloud. Its generative AI security platform Charlotte AI has also gained significant traction.\nOn October 25, CNBC reported that Delta Airlines has sued CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in a Georgia state court following a global outage in July, leading to widespread flight cancellations and disruptions of travel plans that cost the airline over $500 million.\nA CrowdStrike spokesperson told CNBC:\n\"While we aimed to reach a business resolution that puts customers first, Delta has chosen a different path. Delta\u2019s claims are based on disproven misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.\"\nOverall CRWD ranks 9th\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss.

Non-fuel expenses amounted to $170 million, while fuel costs were $50 million lower than they would have been had the flights not been cancelled. Third-quarter per-share profit was also dented by $0.45.\n\"Because the faulty update could not be removed remotely, CrowdStrike crippled Delta's business and created immense delays for Delta customers,\" the airline said in its lawsuit.\nAmid the fallout from the outage, Delta brought on David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner to seek damages from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft, including compensation for losses and litigation expenses related to the matter.\nIn a statement late on Friday cited by Reuters, CrowdStrike said Delta's claims were based on \"disproven misinformation\" and \"demostrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works.\" The lawsuit was a \"desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure,\" CrowdStrike added.\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\nRelated Articles\nCrowdStrike shares slightly lower premarket amid Delta lawsuit over summer outage\nMorgan Stanley explains why rates are rising\nEuropean shares gain as key data and US tech earnings loom\nView Comments"

But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\nCheck out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhat's The Opportunity In CrowdStrike Holdings?\nGreat news for investors \u2013 CrowdStrike Holdings is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $420.23, but it is currently trading at US$301 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from CrowdStrike Holdings?\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. CrowdStrike Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRWD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CRWD for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy CRWD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nStory Continues\nIf you want to dive deeper into CrowdStrike Holdings, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the BofA's List Of AI & Semiconductor Stocks That Fund Managers Love & Hate: 16 Stocks On The Manager Radar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate.\nThe initial wave of artificial intelligence investing has shaken up the stock market. Suddenly, technology stocks are divided between those that have exposure to AI and those that don't. The former category has soared to set records while the latter has been lackluster because of the state of sluggishness in the non-AI business world.\nWithin AI stocks that have outdone themselves, semiconductor stocks are a standout. Additionally, just as is the case with broader technology stocks, semiconductor stocks are also divided between those with AI and non-AI exposure. The best example of the former category is Wall Street's top AI stock pick. This stock is of a firm that designs and sells GPUs used to process AI workloads. Its shares are up 845% since the 2023 start and have set multiple records since OpenAI's Chat GPT became publicly available.\nOn the flip side, another semiconductor stock has floundered during the same period even though it's one of the oldest and largest semiconductor companies in the world. This stock belongs to a firm that is also one of the only three companies in the world that can manufacture high-end semiconductors and it is the only one which is headquartered in the US. While the GPU designer's shares have gained 845%, over the same time, this semiconductor stock is down 13.9%, and year to date the shares have bled an unbelievable 53.14%.\nTherein lies the bifurcation between semiconductor stocks that is fueled by the artificial intelligence wave. However, these returns might belong to the first stage of AI stocks only, implying that other semiconductor companies could also see gains provided robust AI software demand and the ability of firms to monetize their products.\u00a0 We covered a lot of such potential stocks as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks.\nIn this list, there were five semiconductor stocks. Four of these are semiconductor manufacturers while the remaining stock is the firm whose designs are the backbone of the modern-day smartphone industry. The stocks are ranked 19th, 16th, 14th, 8th, and 6th. Looking at their year-to-date performance, these stocks are up roughly 45%, 51.7%, 65.7%, 97.8%, and 122% year-to-date, respectively. Safe to say, the AI wave has been kind to these stocks. The next step in our brief analysis is to see what analysts believe the future holds for these firms. To do this, one particularly useful ratio is the forward price to earnings since it gauges the current price to analyst estimates of future earnings.\nStory Continues\nFor these five phase two AI semiconductor stocks, the forward P/E ratios in respective orders are roughly 31.25, 50.51, 29.41, 25.19, and 99 times. The forward P/E ratio for global and US semiconductor stocks is 45.77 so most of these stocks are fairly valued. Consequently, this implies that in case of an AI correction that sees investor sentiment evaporate for any reason, these stocks might not be hit as hard as those speculating about an 'AI bubble' might worry, but if Wall Street finds more reasons to add to its AI euphoria, then their valuation might further bloom for more gains.\nShifting gears, the average forward P/E ratio for the semiconductor industry also leads us to wonder which stocks are driving this average value higher. After all, the six AI chip stocks we've covered above include some of the biggest companies in the world. However, high P/E ratios commonly belong to smaller companies that earn small profits but have a much higher share price. Two stocks that we've identified that have at least 2x the average forward P/E ratio are both unprofitable right now. The one with the higher forward P/E ratio of 196.08 ranks 20th on our list of Piper Sandler\u2019s Top Technical Stock Picks: 20 Best Stocks while the second with a beefy ratio of 133.33 ranked 32nd on this list of AI stocks that were recently trending.\nSo, the next question to ask is, what makes these stocks so special that despite the fact that neither is currently profitable, investors have valued their shares more than 100 times over their projected earnings? Well, starting from the first stock with the higher P/E ratio, this firm is one of the few hardened integrated circuit manufacturers in the US. It makes radiation-resistant chips for the US military and its tools enable chip designs at various nodes. The second stock, which is up 49% year to date, is a specialty chip manufacturer that makes and sells silicon-based timing devices as an alternative to quartz-based products. These are used in applications such as edge computing and 5G networks - systems that are closer to end users and therefore must endure more strenuous working environments.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of semiconductor stocks that fund managers love and hate according to BofA, we used its recent list of semiconductor stocks that were popular or losing popularity with fund managers. The list was divided into two sections based on expansion or decline in ownership.\u00a0 Stocks within each category were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. For an interesting exercise, you can also compare these stocks with those on our lists of Goldman Sachs\u2019 List Of Stocks That Hedge & Mutual Funds Love & Hate: 28 Stocks On The Mutual and Hedge Funds Radar.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 130\nSection: Gaining Popularity\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a diversified technology company with a presence in the semiconductor and SaaS industries. It has exposure to the semiconductor industry via modems, network controllers, network processors, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These allow Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) products to operate in the smartphone, laptop, and data center industries. The firm also benefits from its ASIC business as it allows it to. work with companies interested in designing their custom AI chips. Consequently, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0 has a wide semiconductor moat which allows it to profit from several industries. Its cybersecurity business adds margin-heavy revenue to the income statement, making Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) one of the most well-rounded firms in the world. However, with Apple's propensity to shift to its in-house chips, the firm could see headwinds in the future if Apple decides to self-design and make chips such as MacBook WiFi modules.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

OpenAI has been planning a custom chip and working on such uses for the technology for around a year, the people said, but the discussions are still at an early stage.\nOpenAI declined to comment. A representative for Broadcom didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and a TSMC spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on rumors and speculation. Reuters reported on OpenAI\u2019s ongoing talks with Broadcom and TSMC on Tuesday. The Information reported in June that Broadcom had discussed making an AI chip for OpenAI.\nThe process for taking a chip from design to production is long and expensive. OpenAI is less focused on graphics processing units, chips that are used to train and build generative AI models \u2014 a market that has been cornered by Nvidia Corp. Instead, it\u2019s looking for a specialized chip that will run the software and respond to user requests, a process called inference. Investors and analysts expect the need for chips to support inference will only grow as more tech companies use AI models to field more complex tasks.\nOpenAI may continue to research setting up its own network of foundries, or chip factories, one of the people said, but the startup has realized that working with partners on custom chips is a quicker, attainable path for now. Reuters earlier reported that OpenAI was pulling back from the effort of establishing its own chip manufacturing capacity.\nBroadcom shares closed up 4.2% to $179.24 in New York trading on Tuesday. Even before the latest gain, they were up 54% this year. TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares closed more than 1% higher.\nBroadcom is the largest designer of application-specific integrated circuits \u2014 chips designed to fit a single purpose specified by the customer. The company\u2019s biggest customer in this area is Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Broadcom also works with Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\nStory Continues\nWhen asked last month whether he has new customers for the business, given the huge demand for AI training, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that he will only add to his short list of customers when projects hit volume shipments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy product to deploy for any customer, and so we do not consider proof of concepts as production volume,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call.\nOpenAI\u2019s services require massive amounts of computing power to develop and run \u2014 with much of that coming from Nvidia chips. To meet the demand, the industry has been scrambling to find alternatives to Nvidia. That\u2019s included embracing processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and developing in-house versions.\nOpenAI is also actively planning investments and partnerships in data centers, the eventual home for such AI chips. The startup\u2019s leadership has pitched the US government on the need for more massive data centers and CEO Sam Altman has sounded out global investors, including some in the Middle East, to finance the effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stretch,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told Bloomberg Television on Monday. \u201cStretch from a capital perspective but also my own learning.

Currently, OpenAI has assembled a team of roughly 20 chip engineers, including experts with experience designing Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Together, they hope to develop OpenAI's first custom chip by 2026\u2014though that timeline is flexible.\nThe news on Tuesday sent Broadcom Inc. shares up 4% and TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares gained more than 1%.\nThe move reflects OpenAI's ongoing strategy to secure consistent chip supply and manage escalating costs, a challenge that other tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft have also faced in their AI ventures. This effort includes OpenAI\u2019s recent decision to integrate AMD chips, along with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, which continue to dominate the market but are in limited supply. In fact, tech giants have been literally begging Nvidia for more chips.\nAt a meeting with analysts last month, billionaire\u00a0Oracle\u00a0cofounder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said he and world\u2019s-richest-man Elon Musk took Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang out to dinner at\u00a0Nobu\u00a0Palo Alto and \u201cbegged\u201d for more GPUs.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

OpenAI considered building everything in-house and raising capital for an expensive plan to build a network of factories known as \"foundries\" for chip manufacturing.\nThe company has dropped the ambitious foundry plans for now due to the costs and time needed to build a network, and plans instead to focus on in-house chip design efforts, according to sources, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss private matters.\nThe company's strategy, detailed here for the first time, highlights how the Silicon Valley startup is leveraging industry partnerships and a mix of internal and external approaches to secure chip supply and manage costs like larger rivals Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft. As one of the largest buyers of chips, OpenAI's decision to source from a diverse array of chipmakers while developing its customized chip could have broader tech sector implications.\nBroadcom stock jumped following the report, finishing Tuesday's trading up over 4.5%.

The index also closed 0.2% higher for the week, recording its seventh straight week of gains, its longest winning streak for 2024.\nYear to date, the Nasdaq Composite has gained 23.4% after soaring 43.4% in 2023, recording its best year since 2020.\nTech stocks rallied last year after a lackluster 2022 when rising interest rates negatively impacted growth stocks. The rally has since continued and gathered steam this year, boosting the Nasdaq. The current rally is largely being fueled by stocks focused on artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, which is also helping the broader market.\nAI Enthusiasm Powering Tech Rally\nWhile AI experts' opinions, particularly on the future of generative AI, are divided, the optimism surrounding this field has been enormous over the past year. Many believe that AI is still in its early stages and that its full potential has yet to be tapped. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been a frontrunner in generative AI and has been pivotal in the surge in interest in this field. Its shares have soared 185.8% year to date.\nNVIDIA\u2019s solid progress in the generative AI space has seen several tech giants trying to leave a prominent footprint in that area. Also, the advancement of smart devices is supporting the field as they require computing and learning abilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analytics. These functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, which are all favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry.\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a strong recovery as a result, following a period of challenges until the first half of 2022.\nStory Continues\nAlso, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first since March 2020. This has been further aiding growth assets, especially tech stocks. Low interest rates typically have a positive impact on growth assets. Market participants are now expecting two more interest rate cuts of 25 basis points each this year, which should further help tech stocks.\n4 Nasdaq Stocks With Upside\nAlphabet Inc.\nAlphabet Inc. is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age.

Top findings include a group of AI Pacesetters\u2014government organizations relatively more advanced in using AI and other emerging technologies\u2014that are driving efficiency and achieving better outcomes than organizations that have been slower to adopt AI-powered workflows and automation. Key insights illuminate the unique ways Pacesetters use AI to improve citizen and employee experiences, strengthen compliance, and scale business processes.\nAccording to the research, many government organizations have yet to reap the full benefits of digital technology and relatively few are leveraging innovation to advance their diverse missions. The report outlines best practices implemented by Pacesetters that can be replicated in other government organizations to improve outcomes.\n\"In today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, governments need AI-driven solutions to meet the evolving expectations of citizens and employees,\" said Jonathan Alboum, Federal CTO at ServiceNow. \"This report reinforces that leading governments are already reaping the benefits of AI through accelerated service delivery, citizen experience, and employee productivity. Whether you\u2019re a Pacesetter or still in the beginning stages of a digital journey, these findings show that the future is promising for those willing to embrace AI.\"\nKey findings from The State of AI-Powered Transformation in Government include:\nImproving Speed of Mission\nPacesetters significantly improve their speed and agility by integrating automation into their organizations\u2019 processes. This profoundly impacts both government employees and the citizens they serve.\nFaster time to value with more benefits. Most Pacesetters (61%) achieve a 1.5X faster return on digital investments and report greater outcomes from those investments \u2013 including higher asset utilization and return (50%), improved compliance and risk management (49%), and faster public services (41%).\nAutomating workflows with end-to-end platforms. Pacesetters are making greater progress in implementing end-to-end platforms, with 67% expecting to make advanced progress within the next three years. Currently, 59% have invented new cross-functional workflows that leverage human and AI collaboration.\nAccelerating productivity and ability to scale transformation. Pacesetters boost productivity via specific digital solutions, such as mobile apps (64%), performance management systems (43%), and AI-enabled tools (38%). Those investments are paying off for Pacesetters, measured by improved staff retention (49%), employee upskilling and reskilling (44%), and productivity (41%).\nStory Continues\nAI-Powered Citizen Service Delivery\nPacesetters are finding new momentum within their Citizen Experience (CX) efforts through unique uses of AI and other digital solutions. This is not only improving citizen service delivery but also helping build trust.\nReshaping government services with AI. Governments are using AI in various ways to accelerate citizen service delivery. The top uses for AI among Pacesetters include personalization of citizen communication and engagement, continuous service improvement with feedback loops, and citizen queries and recommendations.\nTechnology improves citizen experience and builds trust. Pacesetters are making greater use of apps and automation to reach citizens. Compared to the general population of government agencies in our survey, Pacesetters are more likely to deploy mobile apps that citizens can use to access government services (47%), digital identities for easy and secure access to public services (46%), and automated responses to citizen problems or requests (44%).\nTech investments are beginning to drive CX improvements.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the UBS' Top Tech Based Disruptive Stocks For 2030: Top 29 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software as a service (SaaS) firm that provides business process management products and services. This means that the stock and the firm's revenue are dependent on business activity which is influenced by economic health. Consequently, as the economy has continued to chug along in 2024, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s stock is up 38% year to date. Over its four latest quarters, the firm has raked in $1.3 billion in trailing twelve month net income on the back of continued deal diversification. Through this, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) grew its customers with recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% in Q2, and it added six new customers with annual contract value greater than $10 million in Q3. These metrics are key for SaaS companies like ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) as they help broaden the revenue base and add margin heavy revenue to the income statement.\nDuring the Q3 2024 earnings call, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s management shared key details about its deals:\n\"From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was very strong, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Retail and Hospitality also had a fantastic quarter, growing over 80% year-over-year. Health care and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date, U.S. Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution, further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and two over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nOverall NOW ranks 8th on our list of UBS' top tech based disruptive stocks for 2030. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) Thrives with Strong Growth and Profitability\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 1.88%\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the biggest SaaS companies in the world. The firm provides products that enable users to automate their business processes and manage human resource operations, IT operations, and others. The firm has raked in $1.1 billion in trailing twelve-month net income and its shares are up 33.5% year to date. Since it\u2019s a SaaS stock, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u2019s narrative depends on its ability to sustain revenue levels, maintain profitability, grow its customer base, and increase the portion of larger deals within the overall mix. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) appears to be executing well on these fronts. During the second quarter, the firm grew customers with annual recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% and its committed remaining performance obligations by 31% to a whopping $18.6 billion. The latter is a particularly important metric since it measures the money that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is nearly guaranteed to receive in the future. This helps evaluate the firm\u2019s future cash flows.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in\u00a0Adobe\u00a0and\u00a0ServiceNow\u00a0earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 6th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ServiceNow, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NOW a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $13.83.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.3%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.36 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for NOW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Investors in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) had a good week, as its shares rose 3.2% to close at US$951 following the release of its quarterly results.

We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Good afternoon, everyone, I really appreciate you joining today. Because a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report, I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow is growth trajectory. First is elite level execution, with our Q3 results we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution.\nWe outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand. The defense logistics agency works with ServiceNow assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project. Bangkok de Brazil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation.\nThe Veterans Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the Veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI powered solutions to improve its colleague experience.\nAfter rolling out now assist globally, EY works with ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks to deliver faster resolutions for enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life saving mission.\nMercedes Benz work to its ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

Looking ahead, its subscription revenue guidance for next quarter came in ahead. On the product front, the company continued to add new AI capabilities, following the release of the Now Platform Xanadu which includes custom GenAI solutions across industries. Overall, this was a strong quarter.\nIs now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million.\nAlso, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 39.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $959.64 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,034.\nStory Continues\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Key elements driving the company's \"solid beat and raise quarter,\" analysts noted, were its strong execution and client demand.\nMaintaining a $1,075 price target and a Buy rating, BofA highlighted ServiceNow's expansion in customer and staff workflow solutions. The company observed that showing sustainable development, the current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) increase of 23.5% exceeded its 22% expectation. The bank also said that strong customer resonance from ServiceNow's efforts in important areas is paying off.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nMorgan Stanley, meantime, confirmed its equal-weight rating with a $960 target, noting the company's strong generative artificial intelligence posture. Analyzers pointed out, nonetheless, a slowing down in cRPO growth relative to Q2 and suggested a possible slowing down in Q4. Still, they underlined ServiceNow's strong foundation for monetizing generative artificial intelligence solutions by 2025.\nFollowing in line, Stifel and RBC raised their price estimates to $990 and $1,045, respectively. Praising the company's platform strength, rising acceptance of ProPlus and Now Assist, and its recently launched Workflow Data Fabric, RBC called Q3 a \"Home Run Of A Quarter.\" Q3 results of ServiceNow and future direction highlight its strong position in important growth sectors, including government contracts and generative artificial intelligence, which analysts feel will propel momentum into 2025.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

With multiple price target upgrades from BofA, RBC, and other top firms, investor sentiment remains strong, underpinned by ServiceNow's continued momentum in AI and digital transformation initiatives.\nLooking forward, the company is doubling down on global expansion, committing $1.5 billion to boost its UK operations and unveiling new data centers in Italy to meet rising demand. The appointment of Amit Zavery as CPO and COO, coupled with aggressive AI investments, signals ServiceNow's readiness to capitalize on the generative AI boom into 2025 and beyond.
