GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nYelp reported an overall revenue increase of 19% to $40.59 billion and EPS of $6.03, which were both above expectations, albeit the firm recorded a decline in user metrics. Combined monthly and daily active users of its portfolio of apps, including Facebook and Instagram, were a whisker of the forecast mark of 3.31 billion and reported 3.29 billion.\nWhile Enberg did a holistic Emarketer analysis of the meta situation, she acknowledged that user metrics were lacking and that AI offered Meta the means to improve user interaction and ad results in video Reels.\nMeta's management is optimistic. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated, We had a good quarter to show we're making progress with AI across our apps and business, including Meta AI and Llama, as well as glasses AI work.\nMoving forward, Meta posted the guidance of next quarter's revenue to be in the range of $45 to $48 billion, in line with analysts' expectations of about $46.18 billion. However, there are doubts that costs connected with AI progression and the financial picture of Meta's Reality Labs division, which is expected to soar further due to its continuous fund infusion into VR and AR, are rising.\nInvestors are rather focused on Metas moves realizing that it has to undertake vast investment requirements for sustainable digital advertising growth while leading at the cost of smaller networks like Snap.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell over 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 2.7%, while Intel and Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped roughly 3% and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 4.5%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged nearly 9%.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMicrosoft (MSFT) in its earnings report late Wednesday indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from \u201cthird parties\u201d hindered the growth of its AI cloud business in its 2025 fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software.\n\u201cMicrosoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can\u2019t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,\u201d wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\nPersistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen.\nCEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN via Getty Images\n\u201c[A]s long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow\u2026the growth in CapEx will slow and the revenue growth will increase,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.\u201d\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG) in its third quarter earnings report said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. \u201cAs we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,\u201d said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company\u2019s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be \u201clikely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.\u201d\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u2019 quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well as the company\u2019s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday.\nStory Continues\nTo be sure, Big Tech companies\u2019 AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google\u2019s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on mega cap tech stocks Thursday.\nMeta said it expects \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.\"\nNvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "What Happened?\nShares of social network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) fell 6.2% in the afternoon session after the company reported underwhelming third-quarter earnings. Its Daily Active People (DAP, a disclosed volume metric) missed, and it called for \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025\" without pinpointing a specific number. Expenses rose due to investments in infrastructure and AI, and these are likely to eat into profitability in the near term. Notably, Reality Labs accounted for a $4.4 billion in operating loss during the quarter, a large loss that is similar to last quarter.\nAlso, while bets like Threads and Meta AI have recorded promising user growth; they are not expected to contribute significantly to near-term revenue, as monetization for these products remains in development. On the other hand, Meta blew past analysts' EBITDA and EPS expectations, highlighting pockets of strengths. Overall, this quarter highlighted pockets of challenges that need to be surmounted in the coming quarters.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Meta? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nMeta\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 21.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast, while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture.\nThese investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT. Perhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders.\nStory Continues\nMeta is up 62.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $563.36 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $595.94 from October 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Meta\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,940.\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

That followed better-than-expected results from Alphabet Inc. on Tuesday and Tesla Inc. last week.\nStrong reports from Apple and Amazon.com could cement the narrative that the megacap tech group remains Wall Street\u2019s most reliable trade. Disappointments, coupled with the pair\u2019s index weight and multiples, could dash hopes of the market returning to record levels.\n\u201cThe bar is already very high simply because valuations are very high,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cInvestors have become accustomed to the Mag7 and tech and AI-related names not just beating forecasts but smashing them \u2014 and then raising guidance for the next quarter.\u201d\nInvestors are looking to Apple to at long last provide concrete information about demand for iPhones with artificial intelligence features, a product cycle investors are counting on to propel the company out of a low-growth era.\nAmazon\u2019s report will give insight into the state of the consumer with its e-commerce business, while results from its cloud-computing business will show any tailwind from AI, following similar reports from Alphabet and Microsoft.\nShares in Apple and Amazon have essentially kept pace with the market this year. Apple dipped 0.4% on Thursday while Amazon fell 1.3%. Microsoft dropped 4.6% while Meta fell 2.3%.\nThe stakes for Thursday\u2019s earnings reports from the pair have been raised after the market\u2019s negative reaction to Microsoft, which posted stronger-than-expected revenue growth, and Meta, which showed a sales beat.\nMicrosoft tumbled in US premarket trading Thursday after the software maker gave a disappointing forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business and reiterated higher spending to expand AI services. Meta slumped after flagging ramped up investment in AI and other futuristic technologies.\nStory Continues\nApple, in particular, could be vulnerable. Revenue is expected to grow less than 2% in its 2024 fiscal year, and while Wall Street sees that accelerating to 7.6% in fiscal 2025, that\u2019s well below other megacaps, which have consistently delivered double-digit growth. Yet, the company trades at 31 times estimated earnings, a premium of more than 50% over its 10-year average.\nWall Street has been growing cautious, especially amid signs of limited immediate interest in the AI iPhone. The stock has been downgraded twice this month, with both KeyBanc and Jefferies saying optimism has gotten excessive. Amazon received a rare downgrade of its own this month, as Wells Fargo Securities cited margin concerns that its cloud business may not be able to compensate for.\nAmazon shares could also be in a precarious position \u2014 the stock has clawed back losses following its August report, but remains below July highs. Alphabet\u2019s report could be seen as a good sign for Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud segment, as investors will also be watching for payoff from the company\u2019s heavy spending on artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWhat I heard on the Google call made me pretty optimistic,\u201d said Mark Malek, chief investment officer of Siebert Financial Corp. \u201cAssuming Amazon can talk similarly about the cloud, how they\u2019re monetizing and their clients, I think that is gonna be critical for them.\u201d\nAnalysts expect about $27.5 billion in AWS revenue in the quarter, up more than 19% on the year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. If Amazon misses those expectations, \u201cyou could see this narrative of AWS being a share loser in cloud infrastructure gain some steam,\u201d said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\nAmazon investors will also be watching margins closely \u2014 across its cloud and retail businesses \u2014 for signs of growth.\nAmazon needs to show \u201csome degree of positive momentum in margin improvement,\u201d said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management LLC. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve seen margins continue to move higher in AWS is a really very important point given that heavy infrastructure investment that they\u2019re making.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nMeta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg will ramp up heavy investments in AI and other futuristic technologies, continuing a years-long tug-of-war between the company\u2019s long-term bets and the core advertising business that provides the vast majority of Meta\u2019s revenue.\nMicrosoft Corp. shares dropped in late trading after the software maker forecast slower quarterly cloud revenue growth, reflecting the company\u2019s struggle to bring data centers online fast enough to keep up with demand for artificial intelligence services.\nMicroStrategy Inc. has hired banks to help it raise $42 billion through the sale of new shares and fixed income to buy more Bitcoin after a flurry of deals over the past year.\nSamsung Electronics Co. declared progress in supplying its most advanced AI memory chips to Nvidia Corp., seeking to reassure to investors who fear the company is falling further behind SK Hynix Inc. in a red-hot market.\nAndy Jassy kept prodding Alexa with sports questions.

          "whole_article": "Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks tumbled Thursday as investors weighed the tech giants' hefty, ever-increasing AI bills.\nMeta fell over 4%, while Microsoft was down over 5% in midday trading. During their quarterly earnings reports the night before, both companies beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue, but investors appeared spooked as executives said in calls with investors that they expect capital expenditures to continue increasing.\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe mood also weighed on other Big Tech names, including Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which are set to wrap up megacaps' earnings week on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also stumbled, with its stock down over 4%.\nThose capital expenditures have in recent quarter been largely driven by Big Tech companies' investments in generative artificial intelligence infrastructure, such as AI chips. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion during its 2025 fiscal first quarter, while Meta\u2019s expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period (its 2024 fiscal third quarter).\nMeta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the company expects \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.\"\nFor its part, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company expects capital expenditures to increase in the current quarter as the company ramps up investments in AI hardware in response to \"AI demand signals,\" which she said will weigh on its gross margins. The company gave a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for its fiscal second quarter (the current period).\nMicrosoft's softer second quarter outlook came in part due to capacity constraints, as it faces delayed deliveries of AI chips to power data centers on which it runs its AI software, rather than any slowdown in demand, analysts noted.\nWhile investors have expressed concerns about a disconnect between Big Tech firms' AI spending and actual demand from consumers for its AI products, both Microsoft and Meta signaled that demand is real, and Wall Street analysts largely agreed.\nMeta said it\u2019s seeing \"rapid adoption of Meta AI.\"\n\"We are very optimistic about the set of opportunities in front of us and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will not only accelerate our progress, but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each area,\" Li said.\nMicrosoft's Hood noted that its motivation for AI spending is linked to \u201cgrowing demand\u201d for its AI products in the present, and she expects Microsoft\u2019s cloud division sales to accelerate in the second half of its fiscal year 2025 as it \u201ccapital investments create an increase in available AI capacity.\u201d\nStory Continues\nHood added: \u201cRoughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.\"\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Seattle, Washington, on May 21, 2024. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 JASON REDMOND via Getty Images\nFor their part, Wall Street analysts came away with mostly positive sentiments on the companies' performance in the AI space, with the vast majority reiterating their buy ratings on the stocks Thursday, according to Bloomberg data.\nDeutsche Bank analysts said in a note Thursday that they see Meta's AI investments already paying off.\n\"To us, it is becoming increasingly evident that the scaled investments in core AI (and Gen AI) are having a tangible positive impact on advertising performance, driving an ever-widening gap between Meta and its peers,\" they wrote.\nIn a separate note, Deutsche Bank analysts said they see \"Microsoft delivering significant AI value for customers.\"\n\"At a high level, the AI business is on track to exceed a $10 billion run rate next quarter after just 2.5 years, making it the fastest in company history to achieve this milestone and in fairness likely the most capital intensive,\" they said.\nRBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria reiterated the firm's bullishness on the stock: \u201cWhile investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness.\"\nMeanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors: \"[W]e come away from this quarter more bullish (not less) after seeing this AI growth and Copilot monetization play out in real time for Microsoft.\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 With just days before the presidential election, Latino voters are facing a barrage of targeted ads in Spanish and a new source of political messaging in the artificial intelligence age: chatbots generating unfounded claims in Spanish about voting rights.\nAI models are producing a stream of election-related falsehoods in Spanish more frequently than in English, muddying the quality of election-related information for one of the nation's fastest-growing and increasingly influential voting blocs, according to an analysis by two nonprofit newsrooms.\nVoting rights groups worry AI models may deepen information disparities for Spanish-speaking voters, who are being heavily courted by Democrats and Republicans up and down the ballot.\nVice President Kamala Harris will hold a rally Thursday in Las Vegas featuring singer Jennifer Lopez and Mexican band Man\u00e1. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, held an event Tuesday in a Hispanic region of Pennsylvania, just two days after fallout from insulting comments made by a speaker about Puerto Rico at a New York rally.\nThe two organizations, Proof News and Factchequeado, collaborated with the Science, Technology and Social Values Lab at the Institute for Advanced Study to test how popular AI models responded to specific prompts in the run-up to Election Day on Nov. 5, and rated the answers.\nMore than half of the elections-related responses generated in Spanish contained incorrect information, as compared to 43% of responses in English, they found.\nMeta\u2019s model Llama 3, which has powered the AI assistant inside WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, was among those that fared the worst in the test, getting nearly two-thirds of all responses wrong in Spanish, compared to roughly half in English.\nFor example, Meta's AI botched a response to a question about what it means if someone is a \u201cfederal only\u201d voter. In Arizona, such voters did not provide the state with proof of citizenship \u2014 generally because they registered with a form that didn\u2019t require it \u2014 and are only eligible to vote in presidential and congressional elections. Meta's AI model, however, falsely responded by saying that \u201cfederal only\u201d voters are people who live in U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, who cannot vote in presidential elections.\nIn response to the same question, Anthropic\u2019s Claude model directed the user to contact election authorities in \u201cyour country or region,\u201d like Mexico and Venezuela.\nGoogle\u2019s AI model Gemini also made mistakes. When it was asked to define the Electoral College, Gemini responded with a nonsensical answer about issues with \u201cmanipulating the vote.\u201d\nStory Continues\nMeta spokesman Tracy Clayton said Llama 3 was meant to be used by developers to build other products, and added that Meta was training its models on safety and responsibility guidelines to lower the likelihood that they share inaccurate responses about voting.\nAnthropic's head of policy and enforcement, Alex Sanderford, said the company had made changes to better address Spanish-language queries that should redirect users to authoritative sources on voting-related issues. Google did not respond to requests for comment.\nVoting rights advocates have been warning for months that Spanish-speaking voters are facing an onslaught of misinformation from online sources and AI models. The new analysis provides further evidence that voters must be careful about where they get election information, said Lydia Guzman, who leads a voter advocacy campaign at Chicanos Por La Causa.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for every voter to do proper research and not just at one entity, at several, to see together the right information and ask credible organizations for the right information,\u201d Guzman said.\nTrained on vast troves of material pulled from the internet, large language models provide AI-generated answers, but are still prone to producing illogical responses. Even if Spanish-speaking voters are not using chatbots, they might encounter AI models when using tools, apps or websites that rely on them.\nSuch inaccuracies could have a greater impact in states with large Hispanic populations, such as Arizona, Nevada, Florida and California.\nNearly one-third of all eligible voters in California, for example, are Latino, and one in five of Latino eligible voters only speak Spanish, the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute found.\nRommell Lopez, a California paralegal, sees himself as an independent thinker who has multiple social media accounts and uses OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT. When trying to verify unfounded claims that immigrants ate pets, he said he encountered a bewildering number of different responses online, some AI-generated. In the end, he said he relied on his common sense.\n\u201cWe can trust technology, but not 100 percent,\u201d said Lopez, 46, of Los Angeles. \u201cAt the end of the day they\u2019re machines.\u201d\n___\nSalomon reported from Miami.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAccording to a new report by Bloomberg Intelligence (BI), the generative AI market is set for rapid growth, projected to reach $1.3 trillion within the next decade. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 42%, initially fueled by training infrastructure and gradually shifting to inference devices for large language models (LLMs), digital ads, specialized software, and services in the medium to long term. Rising demand for generative AI products could generate an additional $280 billion of new software revenue, driven by specialized assistants, new infrastructure products, and copilots that accelerate coding.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI News Investors Should Not Miss\u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\n\u201cThe world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spending, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops\u201d.\nThe AI world continues to buzz with recent advancements and breakthroughs. On October 29, Linkedin Corporate Communications announced the launch of their first-ever AI agent called Hiring Assistant, developed to take on a recruiter\u2019s most repetitive tasks so that developers can steer their focus on the most impactful work. The company has also rolled out a new coaching feature in LinkedIn Learning to help learners practice human skills through interactive scenarios using text or voice.\nIn other news, Securiti, the pioneer in data security, privacy, governance, and compliance, announced on Tuesday that it has integrated Nvidia's NIM microservices into its Securiti Gencore AI solution, empowering users in industries to easily and quickly build safe, enterprise-grade generative AI systems, copilots and AI agents by utilizing proprietary enterprise data safely in diverse data systems and apps.\nMedicine is another area where AI is driving significant breakthroughs. On Tuesday, October 29, Biotech firm Iambic Therapeutics revealed that it has made a breakthrough artificial intelligence model. The model can radically reduce the time and money needed to develop new drugs. Its new AI drug discovery model is called Enchant, with a white paper published revealing how Enchant demonstrates a high degree of accuracy when predicting how well the human body would absorb certain drugs.\nStory Continues\nAsia is also making strides to take the lead in the AI race. The Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) has unveiled a new Artificial Intelligence method to speed quantum calculations. Professor Yong-Hoon Kim's team from the School of Electrical Engineering has achieved a world-first; succeeding in accelerating calculations for electronic structure in quantum mechanics using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a social technology company that develops applications and technologies to help people connect, find communities, as well as grow businesses. The company is a top AI player in consumer internet, investing heavily in AI-related infrastructure, technology, and products.\nOn October 29, Analyst Justin Post from Bank of America Securities reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Meta Platforms and kept the price target at $630.00, as reported by TipRanks. The Buy rating comes from a combination of factors, such as the company\u2019s strategic initiatives in AI and search capabilities, as well as the development of its AI chatbot with reports of creating an internal search engine to reduce reliance on competitors. The company\u2019s substantial AI resources put it in a strong position to enhance its AI assistant capabilities. Meta\u2019s strong user engagement on social media platforms enhances its potential to develop a competitive search engine and will potentially allow it to capture a share of internet traffic that currently Google holds.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0among the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

But positive Q4 guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher by as much as 12% following the report.\nFor the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of 13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion.\nThat\u2019s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year.\nFor the fourth quarter, Intel said it expects revenue of between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $13.6 billion. The company also said it has two new customers for its 18A process.\nRevenue for the company's Datacenter and AI business came in at $3.35 billion analysts were looking for $3.1 billion. Intel's Client Computing segment, which deals with the sale of chips for laptops and desktops, brought in revenue of $7.3 billion, versus expectations of $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in revenue during the same last year.\nIntel\u2019s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, saw revenue of $4.35 billion. Wall Street was looking for $4.4 billion. The division saw revenue of $4.7 billion in Q3 2023.\nIntel is dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash.\n\u2022 USD\n(INTC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nIntel also had some good news in the quarter. In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success.\nIntel\u2019s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel\u2019s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short.\nIntel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that\u2019s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there\u2019s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they dipped slightly in Q3, according to Gartner.\nThe company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel\u2019s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years.\nStory Continues\nFILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIt\u2019s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company\u2019s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before.\nQualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance.\nIntel\u2019s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company\u2019s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other S&P 500 stocks.\nAs per AXA Investment Managers, the US dominated financial markets this year. The investment firm believes that the broader economy has been stronger than anticipated with GDP growth running at an annualized rate of 3.0% in Q2. The blue-chip benchmark, S&P 500 index, has surged ~22% on a YTD basis. Also, the US fixed-income markets saw strong returns. Overall, the financial markets were supported by the success of the US Fed in dealing with inflation.\nInterest rates have started to move lower, with credit markets reflecting the strength of the broader US corporate sector, per AXA Investment Managers. At the start of October 2024, the investment firm mentioned that a 50:50 allocation to the S&P 500 Growth equity index and the ICE US High Yield bond index might have resulted in a return of ~18% YTD.\nS&P 500 Index \u2013 The Road Ahead\nForbes believes that the prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. While the momentum in technology innovation, together with the environment of lower interest rates, should help the broader S&P 500 index, investors are required to be wary of certain risks. These include elevated valuations, global tensions, and uncertainty regarding the US presidential election.\nAccording to ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, which is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor (RIA), the ongoing innovation in AI and lower rates should help the\u00a0S&P 500 Index see growth in the range of 14.5% \u2013 19.6%. Another firm, Running Point Capital Advisors, expects the S&P 500 to see an increase of 7% \u2013 11% in 2025, with some volatility. As per the company, the influencing factors include economic growth, expansion in earnings, higher mergers and acquisitions activity, and a\u00a0favorable interest rate environment.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\nSectors To Keep on Radar\nForbes highlighted that investors are required to keep certain sectors, like technology, healthcare, and energy, on the\u00a0radar in 2025. As per IDC, worldwide spending on AI, which includes AI-enabled applications, infrastructure, and associated IT and business services, should more than double by 2028 to reach $632 billion. The incorporation of AI, and generative AI (GenAI) in particular, in a range of products should result in a\u00a0CAGR of ~29.0% over 2024-2028, which should help the broader technology sector.\nStory Continues\nDefinitive Healthcare believes that investors should see more device makers and pharmaceutical companies jump on the D2C bandwagon in 2025. Also, ICRA, a Credit Rating Agency, expects a strong financial outlook for the broader hospital industry in FY 2025. The optimistic outlook stems from the increasing incidence of non-communicable lifestyle diseases, a rise in per capita healthcare spending, increased medical tourism, and penetration of health insurance.\nUS Energy Information Administration, in its short-term energy outlook report (October 2024), mentioned that the summer temperatures this year were warmer in the US as compared to last summer, mainly in the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which supported pushing up the US electricity demand. EIA expects 2% more U.S. sales of electricity to ultimate customers in 2024 as compared to 2023, followed by another 2% expected growth in 2025. Overall, it expects electricity sales to increase throughout economic sectors. It projects that commercial electricity sales will rise by 3% this year followed by a 1% growth in 2025.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Among The 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\nSource: Pixabay\nOur Methodology\nTo list the 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we extracted the stocks from the S&P 500 index. After getting the list, stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds were chosen. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holdings: 184\nApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is engaged in designing, manufacturing, and marketing smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories.\nApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been maintaining a strong position in the premium smartphone market, which should continue to drive topline and bottom-line growth. \u00a0Its ability to differentiate products with the help of hardware innovations and software ecosystem enhancements should be able to help it maintain market share and pricing power. Wall Street analysts believe that its services segment should continue to achieve strong growth, aided by improved margins.\nAs this high-margin business expands, it can aid Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s profitability and justify premium valuation. The strong potential for new service offerings and elevated monetization of the existing user base should offer additional upside to revenue and earnings projections. Moving forward, Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s growth trajectory is expected to be aided by a strong ecosystem of products and services and a\u00a0loyal customer base.\nDuring Q3 2024, the company\u2019s business performance was able to generate EPS growth of 11% and ~$29 billion\u00a0in operating cash flow, enabling it to return more than\u00a0$32 billion\u00a0to shareholders.

As we have noted in the past, the Company has been at the forefront of proprietary semiconductor computer processor development for well over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. Apple\u2019s AI value proposition should compel consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release earnings results for its fourth quarter, after the closing bell on Thursday, Oct. 31.\nWall Street expects Apple to report quarterly earnings at $1.6 per share, up from $1.36 per share in the year-ago period. The company projects to report revenue of $94.58 billion after the closing bell, according to Benzinga Pro.\nApple has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in six straight quarters and nine of the last 10 quarters overall.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nUnlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate \u2014 This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield unluck a 1% bonus today!\nWith the recent buzz around Apple ahead of quarterly earnings, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.43%. That\u2019s a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple's $1.00 dividend: $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 shares.\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,380,600 worth of Apple, or 6,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares, or $276,120 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nStory Continues\n\n\nThis option is unavailable due to your privacy preferences.

That followed better-than-expected results from Alphabet Inc. on Tuesday and Tesla Inc. last week.\nStrong reports from Apple and Amazon.com could cement the narrative that the megacap tech group remains Wall Street\u2019s most reliable trade. Disappointments, coupled with the pair\u2019s index weight and multiples, could dash hopes of the market returning to record levels.\n\u201cThe bar is already very high simply because valuations are very high,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cInvestors have become accustomed to the Mag7 and tech and AI-related names not just beating forecasts but smashing them \u2014 and then raising guidance for the next quarter.\u201d\nInvestors are looking to Apple to at long last provide concrete information about demand for iPhones with artificial intelligence features, a product cycle investors are counting on to propel the company out of a low-growth era.\nAmazon\u2019s report will give insight into the state of the consumer with its e-commerce business, while results from its cloud-computing business will show any tailwind from AI, following similar reports from Alphabet and Microsoft.\nShares in Apple and Amazon have essentially kept pace with the market this year. Apple dipped 0.4% on Thursday while Amazon fell 1.3%. Microsoft dropped 4.6% while Meta fell 2.3%.\nThe stakes for Thursday\u2019s earnings reports from the pair have been raised after the market\u2019s negative reaction to Microsoft, which posted stronger-than-expected revenue growth, and Meta, which showed a sales beat.\nMicrosoft tumbled in US premarket trading Thursday after the software maker gave a disappointing forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business and reiterated higher spending to expand AI services. Meta slumped after flagging ramped up investment in AI and other futuristic technologies.\nStory Continues\nApple, in particular, could be vulnerable. Revenue is expected to grow less than 2% in its 2024 fiscal year, and while Wall Street sees that accelerating to 7.6% in fiscal 2025, that\u2019s well below other megacaps, which have consistently delivered double-digit growth. Yet, the company trades at 31 times estimated earnings, a premium of more than 50% over its 10-year average.\nWall Street has been growing cautious, especially amid signs of limited immediate interest in the AI iPhone. The stock has been downgraded twice this month, with both KeyBanc and Jefferies saying optimism has gotten excessive. Amazon received a rare downgrade of its own this month, as Wells Fargo Securities cited margin concerns that its cloud business may not be able to compensate for.\nAmazon shares could also be in a precarious position \u2014 the stock has clawed back losses following its August report, but remains below July highs. Alphabet\u2019s report could be seen as a good sign for Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud segment, as investors will also be watching for payoff from the company\u2019s heavy spending on artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWhat I heard on the Google call made me pretty optimistic,\u201d said Mark Malek, chief investment officer of Siebert Financial Corp. \u201cAssuming Amazon can talk similarly about the cloud, how they\u2019re monetizing and their clients, I think that is gonna be critical for them.\u201d\nAnalysts expect about $27.5 billion in AWS revenue in the quarter, up more than 19% on the year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. If Amazon misses those expectations, \u201cyou could see this narrative of AWS being a share loser in cloud infrastructure gain some steam,\u201d said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\nAmazon investors will also be watching margins closely \u2014 across its cloud and retail businesses \u2014 for signs of growth.\nAmazon needs to show \u201csome degree of positive momentum in margin improvement,\u201d said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management LLC. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve seen margins continue to move higher in AWS is a really very important point given that heavy infrastructure investment that they\u2019re making.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nMeta Platforms Inc.

          "whole_article": "Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks tumbled Thursday as investors weighed the tech giants' hefty, ever-increasing AI bills.\nMeta fell over 4%, while Microsoft was down over 5% in midday trading. During their quarterly earnings reports the night before, both companies beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue, but investors appeared spooked as executives said in calls with investors that they expect capital expenditures to continue increasing.\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe mood also weighed on other Big Tech names, including Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which are set to wrap up megacaps' earnings week on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also stumbled, with its stock down over 4%.\nThose capital expenditures have in recent quarter been largely driven by Big Tech companies' investments in generative artificial intelligence infrastructure, such as AI chips. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion during its 2025 fiscal first quarter, while Meta\u2019s expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period (its 2024 fiscal third quarter).\nMeta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the company expects \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.\"\nFor its part, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company expects capital expenditures to increase in the current quarter as the company ramps up investments in AI hardware in response to \"AI demand signals,\" which she said will weigh on its gross margins. The company gave a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for its fiscal second quarter (the current period).\nMicrosoft's softer second quarter outlook came in part due to capacity constraints, as it faces delayed deliveries of AI chips to power data centers on which it runs its AI software, rather than any slowdown in demand, analysts noted.\nWhile investors have expressed concerns about a disconnect between Big Tech firms' AI spending and actual demand from consumers for its AI products, both Microsoft and Meta signaled that demand is real, and Wall Street analysts largely agreed.\nMeta said it\u2019s seeing \"rapid adoption of Meta AI.\"\n\"We are very optimistic about the set of opportunities in front of us and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will not only accelerate our progress, but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each area,\" Li said.\nMicrosoft's Hood noted that its motivation for AI spending is linked to \u201cgrowing demand\u201d for its AI products in the present, and she expects Microsoft\u2019s cloud division sales to accelerate in the second half of its fiscal year 2025 as it \u201ccapital investments create an increase in available AI capacity.\u201d\nStory Continues\nHood added: \u201cRoughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.\"\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Seattle, Washington, on May 21, 2024. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 JASON REDMOND via Getty Images\nFor their part, Wall Street analysts came away with mostly positive sentiments on the companies' performance in the AI space, with the vast majority reiterating their buy ratings on the stocks Thursday, according to Bloomberg data.\nDeutsche Bank analysts said in a note Thursday that they see Meta's AI investments already paying off.\n\"To us, it is becoming increasingly evident that the scaled investments in core AI (and Gen AI) are having a tangible positive impact on advertising performance, driving an ever-widening gap between Meta and its peers,\" they wrote.\nIn a separate note, Deutsche Bank analysts said they see \"Microsoft delivering significant AI value for customers.\"\n\"At a high level, the AI business is on track to exceed a $10 billion run rate next quarter after just 2.5 years, making it the fastest in company history to achieve this milestone and in fairness likely the most capital intensive,\" they said.\nRBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria reiterated the firm's bullishness on the stock: \u201cWhile investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness.\"\nMeanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors: \"[W]e come away from this quarter more bullish (not less) after seeing this AI growth and Copilot monetization play out in real time for Microsoft.\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAccording to a new report by Bloomberg Intelligence (BI), the generative AI market is set for rapid growth, projected to reach $1.3 trillion within the next decade. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 42%, initially fueled by training infrastructure and gradually shifting to inference devices for large language models (LLMs), digital ads, specialized software, and services in the medium to long term. Rising demand for generative AI products could generate an additional $280 billion of new software revenue, driven by specialized assistants, new infrastructure products, and copilots that accelerate coding.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI News Investors Should Not Miss\u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\n\u201cThe world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spending, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops\u201d.\nThe AI world continues to buzz with recent advancements and breakthroughs. On October 29, Linkedin Corporate Communications announced the launch of their first-ever AI agent called Hiring Assistant, developed to take on a recruiter\u2019s most repetitive tasks so that developers can steer their focus on the most impactful work. The company has also rolled out a new coaching feature in LinkedIn Learning to help learners practice human skills through interactive scenarios using text or voice.\nIn other news, Securiti, the pioneer in data security, privacy, governance, and compliance, announced on Tuesday that it has integrated Nvidia's NIM microservices into its Securiti Gencore AI solution, empowering users in industries to easily and quickly build safe, enterprise-grade generative AI systems, copilots and AI agents by utilizing proprietary enterprise data safely in diverse data systems and apps.\nMedicine is another area where AI is driving significant breakthroughs. On Tuesday, October 29, Biotech firm Iambic Therapeutics revealed that it has made a breakthrough artificial intelligence model. The model can radically reduce the time and money needed to develop new drugs. Its new AI drug discovery model is called Enchant, with a white paper published revealing how Enchant demonstrates a high degree of accuracy when predicting how well the human body would absorb certain drugs.\nStory Continues\nAsia is also making strides to take the lead in the AI race. The Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) has unveiled a new Artificial Intelligence method to speed quantum calculations. Professor Yong-Hoon Kim's team from the School of Electrical Engineering has achieved a world-first; succeeding in accelerating calculations for electronic structure in quantum mechanics using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide. Apple has been positioning itself as a leading AI stock, incorporating artificial intelligence in many of its popular features, such as Siri, Face ID, and recently launching new AI tools on the latest models of its iPhones.\nOn October 29, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced the launch of its all-new Mac mini powered by the M4 and new M4 Pro chips and redesigned around Apple silicon that promises accelerated performance while maintaining a smaller form of just 5 by 5 inches. By virtue of the M4, the Mac mini is capable of delivering up to 1.8x faster CPU performance and 2.2x faster GPU performance over the M1 model. Meanwhile, the M4 scales these advancements for more demanding workloads.\nThe new Mac mini features front and back ports for convenient connectivity, and also includes Thunderbolt 5 for faster data transfer speeds on the M4 Pro model. Designed with Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s personal intelligence system, the Mac mini boasts being Apple\u2019s first carbon-neutral Mac with an over 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across its materials, manufacturing, transportation, and customer use.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC said that the market is narrowing again as he sees gains getting concentrated in big tech stocks again amid bond movements.\n\u201cIf the bond market doesn\u2019t start behaving and calming down, and long-term interest rates don\u2019t stop going up, we are gonna start losing the groups that led us higher for months and go back to our bad old ways with just a couple of magnificent ones.\u201d\nJim Cramer said that this trend was more or less expected as market assumptions following the 50bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve proved to be wrong down the road.\nBut then that darn double cut\u2014we saw something that hasn\u2019t happened since 1995. We saw loan rates go higher, not lower. It was a total buzzkill, and we\u2019re beginning to feel it with earnings.\nCramer then talked about a latest earnings report from a notable homebuilder that showed soft results, indicating a weaker consumer. Cramer then summarized his thesis again on why he sees the overall market trajectory in what he called a \u201csuboptimal situation.\u201d\n\u201cIf interest rates don\u2019t stop rising quickly\u2014they can go up slowly, but this quick rise means we\u2019ll go right back to the same old story. Only a few big tech stocks were winning, while many more were losing. In other words, we\u2019re on the verge of what I can describe as an extremely suboptimal situation if the bond market doesn\u2019t settle down.\u201d\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nJim Cramer on Apple (AAPL) Analyst Reports: \u2018We Have to End Game of Trackers\u2019\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nA frustrated Jim Cramer during a program on CNBC tore apart analyst notes discussing Apple Inc (NASDQ:AAPL)\u2019s iPhone 16 performance based on sales trackers, saying we have to end this \u201cgame\u201d of trackers.\n\u201cJeffries, Loop Capital, and JPMorgan, they\u2019re all playing this game\u2014how good are Apple Inc (NASDQ:AAPL) sales, using trackers?\u201d\nStory Continues\nCramer was referring to different analyst notes trying to gauge how well iPhone 16 is doing based on different indicators and trackers for estimates.\n\u201cWe have to end the tracker game. Let this be the official\u2026No more tracks,\u201d Cramer added.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features. But the latest numbers for iPhone 16 do not show much enthusiasm for the new device.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance as investors continued to favorably discount the recent unveiling of its AI strategy. As we have noted in the past, the Company has been at the forefront of proprietary semiconductor computer processor development for well over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. Apple\u2019s AI value proposition should compel consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

But positive Q4 guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher by as much as 12% following the report.\nFor the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of 13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion.\nThat\u2019s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year.\nFor the fourth quarter, Intel said it expects revenue of between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $13.6 billion. The company also said it has two new customers for its 18A process.\nRevenue for the company's Datacenter and AI business came in at $3.35 billion analysts were looking for $3.1 billion. Intel's Client Computing segment, which deals with the sale of chips for laptops and desktops, brought in revenue of $7.3 billion, versus expectations of $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in revenue during the same last year.\nIntel\u2019s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, saw revenue of $4.35 billion. Wall Street was looking for $4.4 billion. The division saw revenue of $4.7 billion in Q3 2023.\nIntel is dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash.\n\u2022 USD\n(INTC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nIntel also had some good news in the quarter. In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success.\nIntel\u2019s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel\u2019s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short.\nIntel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that\u2019s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there\u2019s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they dipped slightly in Q3, according to Gartner.\nThe company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel\u2019s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years.\nStory Continues\nFILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIt\u2019s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company\u2019s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before.\nQualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance.\nIntel\u2019s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company\u2019s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nFourth Quarter 2024 Guidance\nNet sales are expected to be between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with fourth quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion, compared with $13.2 billion in fourth quarter 2023.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity.

          "whole_article": "Sun Country Airlines is in discussions with Amazon about expanding their air cargo partnership to include special charter flights for dedicated customers, CEO Jude Bricker said on a media call Thursday to discuss the carrier\u2019s financial results.\nSun Country (NASDAQ: SNCY), a hybrid low-cost carrier, operates 12 Boeing 737-800 converted freighters on a daily basis within Amazon\u2019s scheduled domestic air network to support next-day and two-day package delivery.\nAmazon\u2019s (NASDAQ: AMZN) air logistics unit recently unveiled a for-profit line of business that sells excess cargo capacity on its aircraft to 3PLs and other businesses seeking to move general cargo by air. Among the options available to shippers is renting an entire aircraft when it isn\u2019t busy flying for Amazon. Freight forwarding powerhouse Kuehne+Nagel last week said it is using the Amazon Air Cargo service to relay e-commerce shipments from China to the United States.\nMost of Amazon\u2019s fleet, which numbers about 100 aircraft, consists of widebody Boeing 767 converted freighters. Amazon also has six Airbus A330-300s, which are slightly larger than the 767s.\nBricker\u2019s comment indicates that Amazon intends to utilize the narrowbody fleet for charter operations as well.\nSun Country executives have long said the Amazon cargo business provides stable revenue growth and a buffer against fluctuations in the passenger segment. They project cargo\u2019s share of total revenue to double to 20% in the second half of 2025.\nQ3 cargo performance\nSun Country Airline\u2019s cargo segment generated its first positive adjusted pre-tax profit margin since the first quarter of 2022. A rate bump in its parcel transportation contract with Amazon helped the company grow cargo revenue 12%, to $29.2 million, year over year in the third quarter, more than offsetting a decrease in flight hours from the prior quarter.\nTotal cargo flight duration in the third quarter declined 3.6% due to scheduled heavy maintenance for some aircraft and the impact of hurricanes Helene and Milton on cargo operations in the Southeast, according to the Minneapolis-based carrier\u2019s earnings report on Wednesday. Bricker said Amazon had to cancel many flights to its Lakeland, Florida, hub because of the storms.\nSun Country\u2019s other primary operations centers for Amazon are the superhub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and Alliance Field in Fort Worth, Texas.\nSun Country\u2019s cargo revenue per trip grew by 16% from the same period in 2023, while margins were up 8%, thanks to an annual rate escalation on the Amazon contract that went into effect in mid-December and the beginning of new Amazon contract rates that were executed in June. Cargo revenue per trip increased 7% from the prior quarter.\nStory Continues\nSun Country has a six-year contract with Amazon that lasts until May 2026 and can be renewed for two to four years at Amazon\u2019s option. The cargo fleet will grow to 20 aircraft next year when Amazon delivers eight more leased aircraft for Sun Country to fly in its domestic air logistics network under a new transportation services agreement that runs until October 2030.\nThe retail giant is reassigning the aircraft from all-cargo carrier Atlas Air to Sun Country. Chief Financial Officer Dave Davis said in the earnings release that the first aircraft is expected to enter service in late March or early April. Previous guidance projected the first arrival would happen sometime in March. All eight aircraft are expected to be in operation by the end of the third quarter in 2025.\nThe revised Amazon contract rates will continue to escalate as the airline receives additional aircraft and will not be in full effect until the second half of 2025.\nCargo operating income improved from a $609 million loss last year to a positive $2.3 million in the third quarter, which Sun Country attributed to the higher Amazon payments and scheduling efficiency improvements among the cargo, charter and scheduled passenger segments, which offset contractual pay increases for pilots.\nCargo revenue for the first nine months of the year was up 5.5% to $78.6 million.\nSun Country management previously planned to suspend scheduled passenger service in some markets next year to ensure a smooth expansion of the Amazon cargo fleet, but Davis told analysts on a conference call Thursday that the schedule may only shrink about 5% instead of 10% because pilot availability has improved.\nOverall, Sun Country\u2019s net income fell 69% to $2.3 million, the company\u2019s ninth consecutive quarter of profitability. The airline achieved record third-quarter revenue of $249 million, roughly flat from a year ago, despite the impact of the CrowdStrike IT outage and hurricanes. Revenue for the passenger segment, which includes scheduled charter flying, fell 3%.\nManagement said passenger booking activity is strong through the winter season and fares are rising after the domestic industry weeded out some capacity.\nThe airline continues to contain costs better than other carriers, with cost per available seat mile up 1.9%. While fuel costs are down, landing fees and airport rent increased 14.5% due to the expiration of COVID assistance that airports had used to limit rate increases. The company continues to produce free cash flow and bring down debt levels.\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.\nRELATED STORIES:\nAmazon airline sells excess cargo capacity to third-party shippers\nAmazon flying to generate 20% of Sun Country Airlines\u2019 revenue\nThe post Amazon explores cargo charter service with Sun Country Airlines appeared first on FreightWaves.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Hundreds of Amazon staff have complained that executives are \u201cdismissing their humanity\u201d by\u00a0demanding they return to the office five days per week.\nIn a letter sent to Matt Garman, chief executive of the tech giant\u2019s Amazon Web Services (AWS) division, staff said they were \u201cappalled\u201d by what they called his \u201cnon-data-driven\u201d\u00a0attack on working from home.\nMr Garman, who is based in Seattle, had previously insisted that nine in 10 Amazon staff were \u201cquite excited\u201d about coming back to the office full time, adding there was \u201cno substitute\u201d for \u201cgetting up on a whiteboard\u201d or \u201chaving a brainstorm\u201d.\nHe said that if employees did not like the changes \u201cthere are other companies around\u201d, implying that they should quit and move elsewhere.\nThe Amazon workers argued Mr Garman\u2019s remarks were an \u201coutright abdication of AWS\u2019s role as one of the world\u2019s most innovative companies\u201d. The workers insisted research showed that more flexible working helped companies like Amazon recruit and retain the best staff.\nThe group claimed Mr Garman was \u201csilencing critical perspectives and damaging our culture and our future in doing so\u201d.\nThey alleged \u201cprotected\u201d groups would be \u201cdisproportionately impacted\u201d by the changes, including older workers, \u201cworking parents (especially those with young children), employees who are neurodiverse or have disabilities or disorders, workers with caretaking responsibilities and workers on a visa who have no choice but to comply, or risk having to leave their home by quitting\u201d.\nThe employees said they would \u201cnot stand silently by while you dismiss their humanity and trivialise their impact\u201d.\nThe staff members added that Amazon had been highly successful while nearly all staff were working remotely during the pandemic.\n\u201cOur time working remotely during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic proved that we are effective, creative and successful without being primarily in-person, and to take no lessons from that experience would be extremely disappointing,\u201d they said.\nAmazon and other technology giants have been trying to\u00a0coax staff back to the office after embracing working from home during the pandemic.\nThe online retailer had already demanded that staff return to the workplace three days per week. But last month, Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, said all the company\u2019s white collar staff would be expected at their desks from Jan 2. Mr Jassy said staff worked best when \u201cjoined at the hip with your teammates\u201d.\nAmazon employs more than 1.5m people, although the vast majority of these work in the company\u2019s warehouses. It has in the region of 300,000 corporate staff.\nWhile other technology giants have tightened up their rules around home-working, Meta, Google and Apple all currently allow most staff to work remotely multiple times per week. Amazon was contacted for comment."

Disappointments, coupled with the pair\u2019s index weight and multiples, could dash hopes of the market returning to record levels.\n\u201cThe bar is already very high simply because valuations are very high,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cInvestors have become accustomed to the Mag7 and tech and AI-related names not just beating forecasts but smashing them \u2014 and then raising guidance for the next quarter.\u201d\nInvestors are looking to Apple to at long last provide concrete information about demand for iPhones with artificial intelligence features, a product cycle investors are counting on to propel the company out of a low-growth era.\nAmazon\u2019s report will give insight into the state of the consumer with its e-commerce business, while results from its cloud-computing business will show any tailwind from AI, following similar reports from Alphabet and Microsoft.\nShares in Apple and Amazon have essentially kept pace with the market this year. Apple dipped 0.4% on Thursday while Amazon fell 1.3%. Microsoft dropped 4.6% while Meta fell 2.3%.\nThe stakes for Thursday\u2019s earnings reports from the pair have been raised after the market\u2019s negative reaction to Microsoft, which posted stronger-than-expected revenue growth, and Meta, which showed a sales beat.\nMicrosoft tumbled in US premarket trading Thursday after the software maker gave a disappointing forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business and reiterated higher spending to expand AI services. Meta slumped after flagging ramped up investment in AI and other futuristic technologies.\nStory Continues\nApple, in particular, could be vulnerable. Revenue is expected to grow less than 2% in its 2024 fiscal year, and while Wall Street sees that accelerating to 7.6% in fiscal 2025, that\u2019s well below other megacaps, which have consistently delivered double-digit growth. Yet, the company trades at 31 times estimated earnings, a premium of more than 50% over its 10-year average.\nWall Street has been growing cautious, especially amid signs of limited immediate interest in the AI iPhone. The stock has been downgraded twice this month, with both KeyBanc and Jefferies saying optimism has gotten excessive. Amazon received a rare downgrade of its own this month, as Wells Fargo Securities cited margin concerns that its cloud business may not be able to compensate for.\nAmazon shares could also be in a precarious position \u2014 the stock has clawed back losses following its August report, but remains below July highs. Alphabet\u2019s report could be seen as a good sign for Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud segment, as investors will also be watching for payoff from the company\u2019s heavy spending on artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWhat I heard on the Google call made me pretty optimistic,\u201d said Mark Malek, chief investment officer of Siebert Financial Corp. \u201cAssuming Amazon can talk similarly about the cloud, how they\u2019re monetizing and their clients, I think that is gonna be critical for them.\u201d\nAnalysts expect about $27.5 billion in AWS revenue in the quarter, up more than 19% on the year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. If Amazon misses those expectations, \u201cyou could see this narrative of AWS being a share loser in cloud infrastructure gain some steam,\u201d said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\nAmazon investors will also be watching margins closely \u2014 across its cloud and retail businesses \u2014 for signs of growth.\nAmazon needs to show \u201csome degree of positive momentum in margin improvement,\u201d said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management LLC. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve seen margins continue to move higher in AWS is a really very important point given that heavy infrastructure investment that they\u2019re making.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nMeta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg will ramp up heavy investments in AI and other futuristic technologies, continuing a years-long tug-of-war between the company\u2019s long-term bets and the core advertising business that provides the vast majority of Meta\u2019s revenue.\nMicrosoft Corp. shares dropped in late trading after the software maker forecast slower quarterly cloud revenue growth, reflecting the company\u2019s struggle to bring data centers online fast enough to keep up with demand for artificial intelligence services.\nMicroStrategy Inc. has hired banks to help it raise $42 billion through the sale of new shares and fixed income to buy more Bitcoin after a flurry of deals over the past year.\nSamsung Electronics Co. declared progress in supplying its most advanced AI memory chips to Nvidia Corp., seeking to reassure to investors who fear the company is falling further behind SK Hynix Inc. in a red-hot market.\nAndy Jassy kept prodding Alexa with sports questions. It was summer 2023, and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s chief executive officer wanted to see if a prototype of the voice assistant, upgraded with artificial intelligence, was good enough to compete with ChatGPT, the AI chatbot from OpenAI that had wowed the world around eight months earlier with its conversational wizardry.\nEarnings Due Thursday\nPremarket\nOpen Text\nArrow Electronics\nInsight Enterprises\nVontier Corp\nBelden\nItron\nAllegro MicroSystems\nInterDigital\nSolarWinds\nCoreCard\nComcast\nRoblox\nCinemark\nGannett Co\nClear Channel Outdoor\nMarcus Corp\nBandwidth\nPostmarket\nApple\nAmazon\nIntel\nAtlassian\nJuniper\nOnto Innovation Inc\nViavi\nCohu\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Jeran Wittenstein.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nHow Elon Musk Came to Embrace the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Frustrated Amazon employees opened another front in their fight against the company\u2019s return-to-office mandate.\nOn Wednesday, 523 employees in the Amazon Web Services division sent its chief executive, Matt Garman, an open letter detailing their frustration with the new policy.\n\u201cOur time working remotely during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic proved that we are effective, creative, and successful without being primarily in-person, and to take no lessons from that experience would be extremely disappointing, because Amazon is and always will be a global company,\u201d the open letter reads.\nIn September, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that as of January 2025, employees would have to return to the office five days a week. Amazon employees are currently expected to be in the office three days a week. The move set off a new wave of unrest at Amazon. Employees had previously voiced their displeasure at each new policy that required more days in the office through walkouts, open letters, and threatening to quit.\nJassy and Amazon\u2019s senior leadership regularly cite the need to return to office in order to increase collaboration and innovation. Executives have reiterated their beliefs these tasks are better performed via in-person work than remote work.\nThe letter came as a response to comments Garman made to that effect during an all-hands meeting earlier this month.\n\u201cWhen we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we're not in-person,\u201d Garman said in comments reported by Business Insider. \u201cThere is just no substitute for getting up on a whiteboard and walking through what's going on, having a brainstorm and stopping in the cubicle next to you.\u201d\nThe research on whether remote or in-person work is better for a company is rather split. There is no doubt that flexible work is a desirable perk that helps attract talent, retain existing employees, and improve overall morale. However, the distance and lack of spontaneity caused by team members being remote does indeed inhibit collaboration and innovation, according to a July study published in Nature.\nThe question then becomes how to balance these two competing realities. An RTO policy that increases innovation, but leads to a staff exodus, would be self-defeating, the open letter argues.\n\u201cReturn-to-office mandates tend to push out more senior and tenured employees across the board, who may be best poised to participate in and give insight into these white-boarding and brainstorming sessions you refer to,\u201d the letter reads.\nStory Continues\nAmazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said the company was notifying employees now so that they would have time to adjust to the transition in the new year. Callahan cited several resources meant to ease the process such as commuter benefits and free memberships to services that offer caregivers.\nAmazon\u2019s fraying culture\nGarman said many of the employees he\u2019d spoken with were in favor of returning to the office five days a week. During the meeting, Garman told staff \u201cnine out of ten employees\u201d he\u2019d spoken with were \u201cactually quite excited by this change.\u201d\nThe letter strongly criticized Garman\u2019s sentiments for being out of step with Amazon\u2019s company culture.\n\u201cNot only are these comments inconsistent with the experiences of many employees, they indicate an outright abdication of AWS' role as one of the world's most innovative companies and a leader in our industry,\u201d the letter reads.\nThe changing nature of Amazon\u2019s culture has been a growing topic of consternation at the company. Amazon was once hailed as the paragon of a rock-solid corporate culture that had both universal buy-in from employees and the ability to deliver results. Some, both within the company and outside of it, feel the culture is straying from its foundations of being detail-oriented and making data-driven decisions.\nReturning to the office full-time is a way to help rectify that issue, according to Andy Jassy. \u201cWe\u2019ve observed that it\u2019s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture\u201d when they\u2019re together in the office, Jassy wrote in his September memo outlining the plan.\nThe decision to implement the new RTO policy failed to live up to Amazon\u2019s culture because it wasn\u2019t sufficiently data-driven, according to the letter.\n\u201cAmazon claims to be a data-driven company, and statements which rely on \u2018we believe\u2019 and \u2018I feel,\u2019 or exclaim how many people are excited about something to justify themselves fail to achieve our standard of decision making for critical issues that impact hundreds of thousands of the company's employees and its customers,\u201d signatories of the letter wrote.\nEmployees in the letter wrote they were \u201cappalled\u201d at the perceived lack of data used to inform the RTO rules.\n\u201cYour statements indicate that either you have not collected enough data to support your position but are moving ahead anyways, or you have seen the data which indicates otherwise and are choosing to ignore it, or you have motivations to support this policy which you are not being forthcoming about with those it impacts,\u201d the letter continued.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks tumbled Thursday as investors weighed the tech giants' hefty, ever-increasing AI bills.\nMeta fell over 4%, while Microsoft was down over 5% in midday trading. During their quarterly earnings reports the night before, both companies beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue, but investors appeared spooked as executives said in calls with investors that they expect capital expenditures to continue increasing.\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe mood also weighed on other Big Tech names, including Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which are set to wrap up megacaps' earnings week on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also stumbled, with its stock down over 4%.\nThose capital expenditures have in recent quarter been largely driven by Big Tech companies' investments in generative artificial intelligence infrastructure, such as AI chips. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion during its 2025 fiscal first quarter, while Meta\u2019s expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period (its 2024 fiscal third quarter).\nMeta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the company expects \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.\"\nFor its part, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company expects capital expenditures to increase in the current quarter as the company ramps up investments in AI hardware in response to \"AI demand signals,\" which she said will weigh on its gross margins. The company gave a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for its fiscal second quarter (the current period).\nMicrosoft's softer second quarter outlook came in part due to capacity constraints, as it faces delayed deliveries of AI chips to power data centers on which it runs its AI software, rather than any slowdown in demand, analysts noted.\nWhile investors have expressed concerns about a disconnect between Big Tech firms' AI spending and actual demand from consumers for its AI products, both Microsoft and Meta signaled that demand is real, and Wall Street analysts largely agreed.\nMeta said it\u2019s seeing \"rapid adoption of Meta AI.\"\n\"We are very optimistic about the set of opportunities in front of us and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will not only accelerate our progress, but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each area,\" Li said.\nMicrosoft's Hood noted that its motivation for AI spending is linked to \u201cgrowing demand\u201d for its AI products in the present, and she expects Microsoft\u2019s cloud division sales to accelerate in the second half of its fiscal year 2025 as it \u201ccapital investments create an increase in available AI capacity.\u201d\nStory Continues\nHood added: \u201cRoughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.\"\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Seattle, Washington, on May 21, 2024. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 JASON REDMOND via Getty Images\nFor their part, Wall Street analysts came away with mostly positive sentiments on the companies' performance in the AI space, with the vast majority reiterating their buy ratings on the stocks Thursday, according to Bloomberg data.\nDeutsche Bank analysts said in a note Thursday that they see Meta's AI investments already paying off.\n\"To us, it is becoming increasingly evident that the scaled investments in core AI (and Gen AI) are having a tangible positive impact on advertising performance, driving an ever-widening gap between Meta and its peers,\" they wrote.\nIn a separate note, Deutsche Bank analysts said they see \"Microsoft delivering significant AI value for customers.\"\n\"At a high level, the AI business is on track to exceed a $10 billion run rate next quarter after just 2.5 years, making it the fastest in company history to achieve this milestone and in fairness likely the most capital intensive,\" they said.\nRBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria reiterated the firm's bullishness on the stock: \u201cWhile investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness.\"\nMeanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors: \"[W]e come away from this quarter more bullish (not less) after seeing this AI growth and Copilot monetization play out in real time for Microsoft.\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But the fundamental problem, he said, is that Tesla doesn\u2019t have a \u201ctechnology that worked.\u201d\n\u201cBy works, I want to differentiate between a driver assistance system that drives most the time except when it doesn\u2019t and then you have to take over versus a system that\u2019s so reliable and robust that you don\u2019t need a person in it,\u201d Levinson said.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nLevinson said that he drives a Tesla and uses its full self-driving (FSD) driver assistance system \u201cevery couple of weeks.\u201d While the system is \u201cimpressive,\u201d it is also a bit \u201cstressful\u201d, he said.\n\u201c...usually it does the right thing and then it sort of lulls you into this false sense of complacency and then it does the wrong thing. You\u2019re like \u201coh my god.\u201d They are about 100 times less safe than a human,\u201d Levinson said while also pinning it down to the company\u2019s use of just cameras and AI to enable self-driving.\n\u201c...you really do need significantly more hardware than Tesla is putting in the vehicles to build a robotaxi that\u2019s not just as safe but especially safer than a human,\u201d he opined while adding that there is a need for sensor data despite advancements in AI to protect against camera malfunctions and ensure fully safe rides.\nTrending: The Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

Cybercab, Musk then said, will enter production \u2018before 2027' and will be priced below $30,000. Until then, Tesla\u2019s ride-hail fleet will be composed of the company's Model 3 and Model Y.\nZoox, meanwhile, will launch its custom-built robotaxi with no pedals or steering wheel in San Francisco and Las Vegas in the coming weeks, Levinson said on Wednesday. The company will start taking members of the public for rides in the vehicle starting next year, he added.\nImage via Shutterstock\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by\u00a0following this link.\nRead Next:\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

AMZN, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, Boston Scientific Corp. BSX and Armanino Foods of Distinction, Inc. AMNF.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nTop Stock Reports for Amazon, J&J and Boston Scientific\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific Corp., as well as a micro-cap stock Armanino Foods of Distinction, Inc.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\nAmazon.com's shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+27.2% vs. +25.4%). The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.\n\nAmazon.com's expanding global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses, remain a plus. Growing adoption of AWS is aiding Amazon's cloud dominance. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Also, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings are tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives.\n\nHowever, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Amazon issued weak third-quarter 2024 revenue guidance due to the changing shopping pattern of consumers, which is a negative.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have gained +3.6% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +19.1%. The company beat third-quarter estimates for earnings and sales. Its Innovative Medicine unit is performing at above-market levels. Growth is being driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and also continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.\n\nJ&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions with important readouts lined up for 2025. However, sales in the MedTech segment have been lower than expected due to Asia-Pacific headwinds, specifically in China.\n\nJ&J faces the upcoming patent expiration of the blockbuster drug Stelara in January 2025, which will hurt the drug's sales. J&J is incurring huge legal expenses due to the pending lawsuits related to its talc products.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)\n\nBoston Scientific's shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the year-to-date period (+45.9% vs. +15.3%). The company is seeing strength across target markets despite macroeconomic concerns, currency headwinds and related cost inflation. Strong worldwide demand for its MedSurg and Structural Heart lines, traction in United States and outside for its the next generation WATCHMAN FLX and FLX Pro, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers.\n\nThe Pain and Brain franchisees are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on strong execution of core growth strategies.

Also, ICRA, a Credit Rating Agency, expects a strong financial outlook for the broader hospital industry in FY 2025. The optimistic outlook stems from the increasing incidence of non-communicable lifestyle diseases, a rise in per capita healthcare spending, increased medical tourism, and penetration of health insurance.\nUS Energy Information Administration, in its short-term energy outlook report (October 2024), mentioned that the summer temperatures this year were warmer in the US as compared to last summer, mainly in the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which supported pushing up the US electricity demand.

So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Amazon.com grew its EPS by 13% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Amazon.com shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 3.4% to 9.0%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Amazon.com's forecast profits?\nAre Amazon.com Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$2.0t company like Amazon.com. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$213b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\nIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Amazon.com, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.\nStory Continues\nAmazon.com's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$1.7m in the year prior to December 2023. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.\nIs Amazon.com Worth Keeping An Eye On?\nOne important encouraging feature of Amazon.com is that it is growing profits. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Amazon.com, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Amazon.com by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Outdoor Brands, Inc. AOUT, Crocs, Inc. CROX, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Mattel, Inc. MAT.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n5 Discretionary Stocks to Buy as Consumer Confidence Hits 9-Month High\nU.S. consumers are much more confident now than they were last month. A jumbo rate cut announced last month by the Federal Reserve, coupled with optimism surrounding more interest rate cuts in the coming months, have made consumers confident about the economy's health.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in discretionary stocks such as American Outdoor Brands, Inc., Crocs, Inc., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Netflix, Inc. and Mattel, Inc.. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nConsumer Confidence Soars\nThe Conference Board said on Tuesday that the consumer confidence index surged to 108.7 in October, from 99.2 in the previous month, to hit its highest level in nine months.\nThe Present Situation Index, a measure of consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, jumped 14.2 points to reach 138. The Expectations Index, a measure of consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market situation, rose 6.3 points to 89.1. This was comfortably above the threshold of 80. Any reading below 80 indicates impending recession.\nThe jump in consumer confidence comes after ebbing drastically in September on fears of a slowing economy. Interestingly, consumer confidence remained high in October despite data suggesting a cooling job market.\nThe Labor Department said on Tuesday that job openings fell to a three-and-a-half-year low in September. Despite the decline, the Conference Board's survey showed that consumers' perceptions of the jobs market improved in October, which boosted their confidence.\nMore Rate Cut Hopes Boost Consumer Confidence\nFears gripped markets earlier this month after fresh data showed a slight uptick in monthly inflation in September. This raised concerns over the economy's health, turning markets volatile.\nHowever, consumers are hoping that inflation will still be on track to reach the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first rate cut since March 2020.\nStory Continues\nThe Federal Reserve has also hinted that more rate cuts are on the horizon if inflation continues to ease substantially. The CME FedWatch tool presently shows a 98.9% possibility of a 25-basis point cut in November and a 76.6% probability of a 20-basis point cut in December. Lower borrowing rates typically benefit growth stocks like tech and consumer discretionary.\n4 Discretionary Stocks With Upside\nAmerican Outdoor Brands\nAmerican Outdoor Brands, Inc. is a provider of outdoor products and accessories, including hunting, fishing, camping, shooting and personal security and defense products, for rugged outdoor enthusiasts.

          "whole_article": "Roku (ROKU) stock fell around 16% in early trading on Thursday after the company's fourth quarter guidance disappointed, despite the media player reporting its first quarter of $1 billion in revenue.\nFor the current quarter, the company estimated gross profit to hit $465 million, with adjusted EBITDA expected at $30 million. Both metrics fell below Wall Street expectations of $477 million in gross profit and $36.2 million in adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022 USD\n(ROKU)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe company also said it will stop reporting streaming households as a key performance metric, echoing a similar move from streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), which will no longer report subscriber figures at the start of next year.\nInstead, Roku said it will focus on streaming hours, platform revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n\"Since our IPO in 2017, the streaming industry has evolved meaningfully, with Americans now spending significantly more TV time streaming than watching cable,\" Roku said in its earnings release. \"Our business has also grown and evolved, and we are now primarily focused on growing platform revenue and profitability.\"\nPrior to Wednesday's release, shares had rallied more than 30% over the past three months on expectations of a strong ad market and upside to platform revenue growth.\nIt's a critical shift for the company, which underwent a number of cost-cutting measures last year in an effort to bring down operating expenses and improve profits. Roku has recently committed to various monetization initiatives, which have included a deeper integration with programmatic advertising giant the Trade Desk (TTD).\nRoku said those efforts, along with tailwinds from political ad spend, will \"continue in Q4.\"\nA Roku logo is seen on a screen with a silhouette of a hand holding a tv remote. (Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) \u00b7 SOPA Images via Getty Images\nIn the third quarter, Roku reported net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 16% year over year, with a net loss of $65 million, or $0.06 a share. That quarterly net loss was significantly narrower than the $0.33 loss Wall Street expected, as well as the prior-year period's $2.33 quarterly loss.\nPlatform revenue, which includes ad sales, revenue from distribution deals, and the over-the-top streaming service, the Roku Channel, came in at $908 million, up 15% on the year.\nThe boom was driven by strength in advertising sales, content distribution, and expansion into international markets.\n\"In Q3, the year-over-year growth of advertising activities across the Roku platform \u2014 excluding media and entertainment \u2014 outperformed both the overall ad market and the over-the-top (OTT) ad market in the US,\" Roku said, highlighting strength in political, retail, and consumer packaged goods ad verticals.\nStory Continues\nThe company reported 85.5 million streaming households, a sequential increase of 2 million and up 13% year over year. Streaming hours also increased 5.3 billion year over year to reach 32 billion in the quarter.\nOverall, the company has been facing more competition in the connected TV and streaming ads business.\nAmazon (AMZN) rolled out ads on its Prime Video streaming service earlier this year in the US. Wall Street has noted the massive disruption the tech giant has already caused in the space as companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) are also in the running for ad buyers.\nOn Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne reiterated his Underweight rating on shares, categorizing recent optimism as \"premature\" and rising competition \"as an under-appreciated risk.\"\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

If that holds in trading Thursday, it will be the biggest one-day loss since a 24% decline on Feb. 16, when the company issued a lower-than-expected forecast.\nThe decision to withhold the data follows a similar one by Netflix Inc. in April, when the company announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers.\n\u201cBeginning with our Q1 2025 earnings results, we will no longer report quarterly updates on streaming households,\u201d the company said in a statement. That means it will also no longer report average revenue per user.\nThe company said its key performance metrics will be streaming hours, platform revenue, adjusted earnings and free cash flow.\n\u201cWe will continue to grow streaming households and will continue to track and announce key milestones such as 100 million HHs, which we said we expect to reach in the next 12-18 months,\u201d the company said in an email.\nThe company also issued a fourth-quarter profit forecast that fell short of Wall Street estimates.

That\u2019s below the $36.2 million average of analysts\u2019 estimates.\nIn April, shares of Netflix fell after the company announced it would stop reporting both subscribers and average revenue per user starting in the first quarter of 2025.\n(Updates with company comment in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nHow Elon Musk Came to Embrace the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Back in 2002, Martha Stewart made headlines for aggressively chopping a cabbage in an effort to avoid speaking of insider-trading allegations. \u201cI want to focus on my salad,\u201d she said through tight lips. Fast-forward more than a decade later and Stewart is still trying to change the focus to more flattering aspects of her life. Or in other words, focus on her salad.\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Stewart apparently spent around 30 minutes complaining about Martha, the Netflix documentary made about her. Calling the second part of the movie \u201ca bit lazy,\u201d Stewart took issue with the way director R.J. Cutler portrayed her.\n\u201cThose last scenes with me looking like a lonely old lady walking hunched over in the garden? Boy, I told him to get rid of those. And he refused. I hate those last scenes. Hate them,\u201d she told the Times, adding that she was limping because she had just had an operation on her Achilles tendon, a detail that the director omitted to her chagrin.\nIndeed, Stewart might have the titular role in said Martha, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s finding herself in all that flattering of a biopic. She said that despite her having three cameras on her, the director would choose \u201cto use the ugliest angle\u201d and ignore her protests to use other ones.\nThe soundtrack was not spared criticism, as Stewart called out the usage of \u201csome lousy classical score,\u201d instead of using mostly rap, which she had deemed an \u201cessential part of the film.\u201d She had suggested that her friend Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre score the film.\nExpressing dismay that some of her more exciting stories were cut, her grandchildren weren\u2019t mentioned, and the allure of her magazines wasn\u2019t touched upon, Stewart expressed her annoyance that her prison sentence got so much attention.\nStewart spent five months, from October 2004 to March 2005, in a minimum-security prison for charges related to insider trading. \u201cI had to go through that to be a trophy for these idiots in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office,\u201d she said in the Netflix documentary, claiming that she was a target because of her title as the first self-made billionaire woman in America.\nShe said of prison that it was \u201cnot a good experience and it doesn't make you stronger\u201d to Katie Couric in 2017. Stewart has since made her comeback, and it appears she doesn\u2019t want to linger on that dip too much.\n\u201cIt was not that important,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cThe trial and the actual incarceration was less than two years out of an 83-year life. I considered it a vacation, to tell you the truth,\u201d she said, adding that the trial was so dull that the judge fell asleep.\nStory Continues\nIndeed, it seems as if over time, Stewart has changed her take on her sentence a bit. In Martha, she calls her daytime show a venture that \u201cmissed the point of Martha Stewart. A live audience, crummy music, that was more like prison than being at Alderson.\"\nThat being said, Stewart praised the first part of the documentary to the Times. She noted that young women have told her that watching the film \u201cgave them a strength they didn\u2019t know they had.\u201d And that was the point of the project.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted the documentary to be. It shouldn\u2019t be me boasting about inner strength and any of that crap. It should be about showing that you can get through life and still be yourself,\u201d she concluded.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best streaming and TV stocks to invest in.\nConsumer Behaviour Around Streaming Choices\nAlmost all streaming services hiked up their rates and drove subscription prices high in 2023. However, cost is not the biggest factor for consumers while they stream. As of today, the price of streaming services doesn\u2019t affect loyalty to an entertainment provider as it did in the past. Amdocs\u2019 \u201cThe New Streamer 2024\u201d report revealed that consumers are expecting improved experiences with rising costs. According to consumers, original content is the top feature that makes a subscription worthy. Other leading factors include access to older titles, new content every few weeks, and being able to watch anywhere.\nTrends Shaping the Streaming Industry\nForbes reported that streamers have been victims of long-term challenges related to profitability and subscriber growth. To counter these issues while catering to evolving consumer demands, streamers are opting for ad-supported plans. With almost half of the younger generation open to seeing more ads, this is a potential way to boost revenue.\nStreamers are also trying to score exclusive agreements and partnerships with sports leagues as live sports has become a hot commodity in streaming. Simultaneously, the cost of original content comes at reduced profitability. Against this, the potential solution is a consolidation of streaming platforms to allow access to deeper libraries of content for consumers without compromising on their priority of having original content on their plate. Additionally, cloud gaming is being integrated into streaming services considering 70% of Gen Z appears to be interested in it.\nOn October 18, Ben Silverman, Propagate Content Chairman & Co-CEO, appeared on CNBC giving examples of the aforementioned streaming industry trends. Commenting on the robust Q3 earnings for streaming giant Netflix, he said that its success would lead to more consolidation among the traditional media players in the smaller streamer space. The company is increasingly investing in original content, sports content, and gaming, something that will continue to reward the company as it expands its profits as well as businesses. While it has the money from its streaming business to make those investments back into streaming, many players in the streaming space do not have the same capabilities. Comcast also has the ability to sell a lot of WiFi and has many other businesses that can drive investment in the content business. He mentioned the telecommunications and media firm\u2019s acquisition of NBCUniversal becoming an engine for the whole company. In the views of Silverman, more troubled are the companies that are pure-play so they need to either consolidate to get to scale or be acquired by the bigger players in the future.\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, Silverman emphasized how sports acquisitions are the key drivers to advertising and not just the drivers in the ability to scale an audience at once. For instance, The streaming giant will be live-streaming two of the 2024 season\u2019s NFL games on Christmas Day. Previously in July, NBCUniversal and the NBA announced an 11-year agreement for NBC, Peacock, USA Network, Sky Sports, and Telemundo to present NBA and WNBA regular-season and playoff games starting in the 2025-26 season.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in, we sifted through ETFs, the Yahoo Finance stock screener, the Finviz stock screener, and online rankings to create an initial list of stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 7 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNetflix, Inc. (NFLX)'s Financial Growth and Future Advertising Ventures\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNumber of Hedge Fun Holders:\u00a0103\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming entertainment service with 283 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries enjoying TV series, films, and games across various genres and languages. Netflix started its journey in 1997 as a DVD-rental-by-mail firm and began streaming in the US in 2007 and internationally in 2010 while it became global in 2016.\nWith streaming entertainment replacing the linear TV experience potentially for an enduring period, Netflix expects to be one of the leading firms of the streaming entertainment era. The firm has been at a scale where it can economically create original content for Netflix since 2013 thereby reaping the benefits of originals. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a major advantage over its linear competitors as its shows don\u2019t compete for scarce prime-time slots like on linear TV. Furthermore, the reach is vast with Netflix being virtually everywhere except for Russia and China.\nIn the third quarter, revenue grew 15% year-over-year. The firm delivered multiple hits in the quarter including The Perfect Couple, Nobody Wants This, Emily in Paris, and CobraKai. Engagement remains strong with view hours per member amongst owner households increasing year-over-year through the first three quarters of 2024. Netflix is simultaneously improving its advertising business, with ads membership up 35% quarter-on-quarter and ad-tech platform set to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025.\nNetflix is well-positioned to bring engaging stories from many cultures to people globally with its global distribution. The firm is all set to benefit from the universal appeal for high-quality storytelling that transcends borders amidst the growing ubiquity of the internet. The firm remains excited about its Q4 slate including Squid Game S2, the Jake Paul/Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. With a steady drumbeat of hit titles from countries globally, healthy member engagement, and a large strong core business, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is poised for growth.\nOverall, NFLX ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of best streaming and TV stocks to invest in.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Electric vehicle giant Tesla TSLA hit headlines recently with an impressive third-quarter earnings report, sending its stock soaring in one of its biggest single-day gains in a decade. Last week, the Tesla stock jumped about 23% primarily due to margin improvement and an upbeat outlook (read: Tesla Records its Best Day in 11 Years: 5 ETF Winners).\nDespite this surge, Wall Street remains divided over Tesla's place in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d \u2014 a group of market-dominating tech giants, including NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Microsoft MSFT and Tesla (read: Is Tesla's Stock Pop Sustainable? TSLA ETFs in Focus).\nAs the third-quarter earnings season kicks off, the Magnificent Seven is anticipated to record 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth, with NVIDIA, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta among the top contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, per FactSet, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nTesla\u2019s Earnings Rebound Yet Leave Analysts Skeptical\nTesla\u2019s third-quarter profits showed a 17% jump, a meaningful rebound after two quarters of decline. However, analysts remain cautious about Tesla\u2019s long-term position among Big Tech, citing concerns that its fundamentals may be overhyped.\nWe would like to note that Tesla\u2019s delivery numbers fell short of estimates in the past. Tesla has been losing market share to its rivals in both China and the United States, resulting in a notable slowdown in growth. This month itself we have seen Tesla\u2019s unimpressive robotaxi event, which failed to meet expectations, raising concerns among ridesharing investors.\nValuation Concerns Add to Tesla\u2019s Strained Standing\nTesla\u2019s pricey valuation further complicates its status within the Magnificent Seven. Although higher growth tends to demand a higher valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 115.54, Tesla\u2019s valuation far exceeds its tech peers.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalyst sentiment reflects this caution. Tesla currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.96 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 2.89 a month ago based on 38 recommendations.\nOf the 39 recommendations deriving the current ABR, Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 23.08% and 5.13%. It is the lowest approval rate within the Magnificent Seven.\nTesla\u2019s Stock Price Target\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 35 analysts, the average price target for Tesla comes to $206.22. The forecasts range from a low of $24.86 to a high of $310.00. The average price target represents a decline of 23.4% from the last closing price of $269.19 as on Oct. 25.\nStory Continues\nCould Netflix be a More Suitable Candidate?\nAs Tesla\u2019s standing falters, streaming giant Netflix NFLX has emerged as a possible replacement, thanks to its strong earnings, subscriber growth, improving free cash flow and solid guidance. Year to date, Netflix stock has surged by 55%, trailing only NVIDIA and Meta among the Magnificent Seven.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWealth Enhancement Group\u2019s Ayako Yoshioka believes Netflix is an appealing alternative due to its strong earnings and solid guidance. Bank of America loves its free cash flow strength, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Same is the view of Portfolio Wealth Advisors\u2019 Jesus Alvarado-Martinez.\nWith free cash flow reaching $2.19 billion in Q3, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier, Netflix\u2019s cash flow has been rising steadily since the pandemic. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich projects Netflix\u2019s free cash flow to hit $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nBroker Rating on Netflix Stock\nOf the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR of Netflix shares, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.5% and 5% of all recommendations. The Netflix stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has an upbeat VGM Score of B. Netflix shares trade at a forward P/E of 37.88X versus 105.6X forward P/E possessed by the underlying Broadcast Radio and Television.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNetflix-Heavy ETFs in Focus\nInvestors who believe that Netflix shares deserve a spot in the tech elite club may play the stock in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) form, too. Netflix-heavy ETFs includesingle-stock funds like T-Rex 2X Long NFLX Daily Target ETF NFLU and Direxion Daily NFLX Bull 2X Shares NFXL.\nOther Netflix-heavy ETFs include MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS (Netflix has a 9.18% weight), Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF GGME (NFLX stock has an 8.35% weight) and First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN (NFLX shares have an 8.32% weight).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks to buy before they split next.\nS&P 500: Targeting 6,000 Amid Market Optimism\nThere\u2019s been a notable sense of fear among investors despite the market\u2019s current strong performance. The upcoming weeks are expected to be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and an impending election, alongside uncertainty regarding the Fed\u2019s next moves. But the fact remains that the market has shown resilience, with numerous new highs for major indices this year, although investors remain skeptical. Historically, volatility tends to increase after elections as political changes take effect. Currently, volatility is relatively low but is anticipated to rise as January approaches and clarity about potential policy impacts emerges.\nDespite prevailing uncertainties, there remains cautious optimism about the market\u2019s ability to maintain its upward trajectory. In mid-October, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC to the skepticism displayed by investors. We covered his sentiment in our article about the\u00a08 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now:\n\u201cKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents\u2019 experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nAround the same time, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss the market trends as well. On October 14, Mary Ann Bartels highlighted that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, she acknowledged that while this target is achievable, the journey may not be smooth.\nStory Continues\nBartels noted that there could be volatility ahead, as evidenced by increased hedging activity in the market. However, she remains optimistic due to the Fed\u2019s shift towards an easier monetary policy and the ongoing economic growth, which is supported by full employment, albeit with a slight slowdown in job creation. Importantly, she highlighted that corporate profits are on the rise, with earnings currently beating expectations by about 5%. This positive trend across fundamental and technical indicators leads her to believe that the market can continue its rally into November and December.\nAs the S&P 500 recently closed above 5,800 for the first time at 5,815, Bartels discussed how this milestone brings the 6,000 target closer. She echoed sentiments from Tom Lee, who suggested that market behavior could improve significantly if there is clarity regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Bartels agreed that once a winner is declared, it could trigger a relief rally as both domestic and foreign investors gain confidence in the stability of US leadership.\nTurning to the Fed\u2019s actions, Bartels addressed concerns about recent CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected. She described potential short-term volatility as a bucking bull, indicating that while fluctuations might occur, the overall trend remains upward. Her year-ahead thesis suggests both fixed-income and equity markets are poised for positive returns, albeit with some bumps along the way.\nBartels also advocated for buying opportunities in the current market environment. She specifically pointed to technology stocks and the NASDAQ, which has yet to hit a new record high. She believes technology will continue to lead the market, particularly emphasizing semiconductors as key drivers of growth. For investors looking to enter the tech sector, she sees this as an opportune moment.\nHer perspective underscores a belief in the resilience of corporate profits and economic fundamentals amid changing monetary policies and external uncertainties. At the same time, it should be noted that the optimistic outlook for the S&P 500 targeting 6,000 is significant for stock splits as it reflects positive market sentiment, encouraging companies to make their shares more accessible to retail investors. When share prices rise, splits can attract more buyers by lowering the price per share. However, it\u2019s important to note that a stock split does not change anything about a business\u2019s fundamentals. A poor company will stay a poor company post-split and a good company will stay a good company.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of stocks that are likely to split. We then selected the 20 stocks that have experienced the highest gains in their share prices over the past 5 years and have a history of spitting their stock. From that, we picked the top 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Netflix Inc. (NFLX) a Top Stock to Buy Before the Next Split?\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nShare Price as of October 18: $689.66\nSurge in Share Price in 5 Years: 150.51%\nStock Split Confirmed: no\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming service provider that offers TV shows, movies, documentaries, and original content. Founded in 1997 as a DVD rental service, it transitioned to a streaming platform in 2007. It has revolutionized the way people consume entertainment and is considered a pioneer in the streaming industry.\nThe company has introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier powered by AI in late 2022 to enhance user experience and deliver more effective ads. As a pioneer in online streaming, it\u2019s a top-performing stock. Its massive and growing subscriber base drives significant revenue growth. In 2023, it achieved record UK revenues, primarily due to increased subscriber numbers following its crackdown on password sharing.\nRevenue was up by 15.02% year-over-year in Q3 2024. Despite challenges in membership growth and ad monetization, it added over 5 million new subscribers and improved its operating margin to 29.6%. International markets drove subscriber growth, and the ad-supported tier saw a 35% quarter-on-quarter increase in memberships. The company\u2019s strategic shift towards advertising has solidified its position as a strong investment.\nManagement announced that the company\u2019s first-party ad server is launching in Canada this quarter and will expand to other markets in 2025. Partnerships with Trade Desk and Google Live are progressing well. There are plans for more ad formats, features, and measurement tools.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) projects a 14.7% increase in revenue year-over-year for Q4, with a target operating margin of 21.6%. Looking ahead to 2025, it anticipates annual revenue between $43 billion and $44 billion, driven by continued subscriber growth and higher average revenue per subscriber. The international expansion and ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences position it for continued growth.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFinally, we trimmed\u00a0Netflix, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:NFLX) mostly due to valuation but also as a source of funds to add to the new position in Shopify. As a reminder, we added to our position in August 2022 amid broad concerns about the company\u2019s ability to grow and monetize shared passwords. We expected Netflix to show progress in monetizing shared passwords, leading to robust free cash flow generation. This is now playing out and is appreciated by the market. Hence, given the balance of growth and valuation, we felt it was appropriate to reduce our exposure to a more normal weight.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 2nd on our list of stocks to buy before they split next. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NFLX, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Investing.com -- Wells Fargo on Monday started research coverage of The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $150 ahead of the company\u2019s Q3 earnings report next month.\nIn a note to clients, the investment bank outlined several factors contributing to the positive outlook, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s increased shift of advertising spend to Connected TV (CTV) and new partnerships that are expected to ramp up, as well as regulatory distractions faced by its rival Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\nMore specifically, analysts believe that the introduction of advertisements on Amazon Prime Video has accelerated the growth of the CTV industry, which is advantageous for The Trade Desk, despite initial concerns from the buy-side about potential market share capture.\nThey note that industry checks indicate that publishers have responded to Amazon's move by increasing ad load by approximately 20% and reducing Cost Per Mille (CPMs).\n\u201cIncreased scale of inventory + better pricing have accelerated shift from linear to CTV, more than offsetting any competitive impact to TTD,\u201d analysts noted.\nLooking ahead, Wells Fargo forecasts a significant benefit for The Trade Desk from unlocking inventory on Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in 2025 and 2026. The firm's revenue estimates are 6% and 8% ahead of the consensus for those years, respectively.\nThe anticipated integration with Netflix and Roku is expected to contribute approximately 400 basis points to The Trade Desk's gross spend growth in 2025, positioning the company's revenues ahead of consensus.\nThe firm also notes that The Trade Desk is likely to continue gaining market share from Google's DV360 in the medium term due to Alphabet's legal challenges.\n\u201cIn our view, the biggest benefit from ad-tech legal challenges at Alphabet/Google is likely to be underinvestment&lack of focus, rather than pot'l business model or industry structure changes,\u201d analysts continued.\nSeparately, Citi analysts said they expect \u201canother strong beat and raise quarter\u201d from TTD, noting that key growth drivers including CTV, Retail Media, and market share gains remain intact. Moreover, there is \u201cadditional upside potential from political spend.\"\nRelated Articles\nWells Fargo starts TTD stock at Buy; Citi expects 'strong beat and raise' Q3 print\nTactical Resources files statement with SEC over planned listing via SPAC\nLucid to open orders for Gravity electric SUV next week\nView Comments"

The investment firm believes that the broader economy has been stronger than anticipated with GDP growth running at an annualized rate of 3.0% in Q2. The blue-chip benchmark, S&P 500 index, has surged ~22% on a YTD basis. Also, the US fixed-income markets saw strong returns. Overall, the financial markets were supported by the success of the US Fed in dealing with inflation.\nInterest rates have started to move lower, with credit markets reflecting the strength of the broader US corporate sector, per AXA Investment Managers. At the start of October 2024, the investment firm mentioned that a 50:50 allocation to the S&P 500 Growth equity index and the ICE US High Yield bond index might have resulted in a return of ~18% YTD.\nS&P 500 Index \u2013 The Road Ahead\nForbes believes that the prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. While the momentum in technology innovation, together with the environment of lower interest rates, should help the broader S&P 500 index, investors are required to be wary of certain risks. These include elevated valuations, global tensions, and uncertainty regarding the US presidential election.\nAccording to ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, which is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor (RIA), the ongoing innovation in AI and lower rates should help the\u00a0S&P 500 Index see growth in the range of 14.5% \u2013 19.6%. Another firm, Running Point Capital Advisors, expects the S&P 500 to see an increase of 7% \u2013 11% in 2025, with some volatility.

As per IDC, worldwide spending on AI, which includes AI-enabled applications, infrastructure, and associated IT and business services, should more than double by 2028 to reach $632 billion. The incorporation of AI, and generative AI (GenAI) in particular, in a range of products should result in a\u00a0CAGR of ~29.0% over 2024-2028, which should help the broader technology sector.\nStory Continues\nDefinitive Healthcare believes that investors should see more device makers and pharmaceutical companies jump on the D2C bandwagon in 2025. Also, ICRA, a Credit Rating Agency, expects a strong financial outlook for the broader hospital industry in FY 2025. The optimistic outlook stems from the increasing incidence of non-communicable lifestyle diseases, a rise in per capita healthcare spending, increased medical tourism, and penetration of health insurance.\nUS Energy Information Administration, in its short-term energy outlook report (October 2024), mentioned that the summer temperatures this year were warmer in the US as compared to last summer, mainly in the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which supported pushing up the US electricity demand. EIA expects 2% more U.S. sales of electricity to ultimate customers in 2024 as compared to 2023, followed by another 2% expected growth in 2025. Overall, it expects electricity sales to increase throughout economic sectors. It projects that commercial electricity sales will rise by 3% this year followed by a 1% growth in 2025.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): Among The 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\nA business professional banking from their laptop, taking advantage of the company's investment services.\nOur Methodology\nTo list the 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we extracted the stocks from the S&P 500 index.

The company\u2019s success revolves around its strong focus on innovation. Its current flagship AI chip, the Hopper architecture, saw healthy demand from cloud service providers and enterprises alike. Wall Street remains optimistic about the Blackwell GPU, which should drive significant revenue growth over the medium to long term.\nNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s CUDA programming platform should continue to act as a significant competitive advantage, providing developers with\u00a0a strong ecosystem for AI and high-performance computing applications.

The company gave a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for its fiscal second quarter (the current period).\nMicrosoft's softer second quarter outlook came in part due to capacity constraints, as it faces delayed deliveries of AI chips to power data centers on which it runs its AI software, rather than any slowdown in demand, analysts noted.\nWhile investors have expressed concerns about a disconnect between Big Tech firms' AI spending and actual demand from consumers for its AI products, both Microsoft and Meta signaled that demand is real, and Wall Street analysts largely agreed.\nMeta said it\u2019s seeing \"rapid adoption of Meta AI.\"\n\"We are very optimistic about the set of opportunities in front of us and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will not only accelerate our progress, but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each area,\" Li said.\nMicrosoft's Hood noted that its motivation for AI spending is linked to \u201cgrowing demand\u201d for its AI products in the present, and she expects Microsoft\u2019s cloud division sales to accelerate in the second half of its fiscal year 2025 as it \u201ccapital investments create an increase in available AI capacity.\u201d\nStory Continues\nHood added: \u201cRoughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.\"\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Seattle, Washington, on May 21, 2024.

On Tuesday, October 29, Biotech firm Iambic Therapeutics revealed that it has made a breakthrough artificial intelligence model. The model can radically reduce the time and money needed to develop new drugs. Its new AI drug discovery model is called Enchant, with a white paper published revealing how Enchant demonstrates a high degree of accuracy when predicting how well the human body would absorb certain drugs.\nStory Continues\nAsia is also making strides to take the lead in the AI race. The Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) has unveiled a new Artificial Intelligence method to speed quantum calculations. Professor Yong-Hoon Kim's team from the School of Electrical Engineering has achieved a world-first; succeeding in accelerating calculations for electronic structure in quantum mechanics using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Available through the company\u2019s ChatGPT website and via its Android and iOS apps, the search platform stands as the biggest potential threat to Google\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) search dominance in years.\nShares of Google parent Alphabet were off 1.5% following the news, roughly in line with the rest of the tech sector, which saw declines on concerns about the industry\u2019s spending on AI infrastructure and uptake from customers.\nOpenAI announced it was testing a temporary prototype search service in July, and this is the result of those tests. The Microsoft-backed (MSFT) company says in addition to pulling general information from the web, the search platform will also offer up content for weather, sports, stocks, news, and maps.\nThe search platform, the company says, runs on its GPT-4o model and also leverages information from third-party search providers and partners that have signed data-sharing agreements with OpenAI.\nAn example of how results will appear in OpenAI's ChatGPT search service.

The investment firm believes that the broader economy has been stronger than anticipated with GDP growth running at an annualized rate of 3.0% in Q2. The blue-chip benchmark, S&P 500 index, has surged ~22% on a YTD basis. Also, the US fixed-income markets saw strong returns. Overall, the financial markets were supported by the success of the US Fed in dealing with inflation.\nInterest rates have started to move lower, with credit markets reflecting the strength of the broader US corporate sector, per AXA Investment Managers. At the start of October 2024, the investment firm mentioned that a 50:50 allocation to the S&P 500 Growth equity index and the ICE US High Yield bond index might have resulted in a return of ~18% YTD.\nS&P 500 Index \u2013 The Road Ahead\nForbes believes that the prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. While the momentum in technology innovation, together with the environment of lower interest rates, should help the broader S&P 500 index, investors are required to be wary of certain risks. These include elevated valuations, global tensions, and uncertainty regarding the US presidential election.\nAccording to ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, which is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor (RIA), the ongoing innovation in AI and lower rates should help the\u00a0S&P 500 Index see growth in the range of 14.5% \u2013 19.6%. Another firm, Running Point Capital Advisors, expects the S&P 500 to see an increase of 7% \u2013 11% in 2025, with some volatility.

As per IDC, worldwide spending on AI, which includes AI-enabled applications, infrastructure, and associated IT and business services, should more than double by 2028 to reach $632 billion. The incorporation of AI, and generative AI (GenAI) in particular, in a range of products should result in a\u00a0CAGR of ~29.0% over 2024-2028, which should help the broader technology sector.\nStory Continues\nDefinitive Healthcare believes that investors should see more device makers and pharmaceutical companies jump on the D2C bandwagon in 2025. Also, ICRA, a Credit Rating Agency, expects a strong financial outlook for the broader hospital industry in FY 2025. The optimistic outlook stems from the increasing incidence of non-communicable lifestyle diseases, a rise in per capita healthcare spending, increased medical tourism, and penetration of health insurance.\nUS Energy Information Administration, in its short-term energy outlook report (October 2024), mentioned that the summer temperatures this year were warmer in the US as compared to last summer, mainly in the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which supported pushing up the US electricity demand. EIA expects 2% more U.S. sales of electricity to ultimate customers in 2024 as compared to 2023, followed by another 2% expected growth in 2025.

(NASDAQ:GOOG): Among The 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\nA financial planner pointing to a graph of investment trends, demonstrating the company's expertise.\nOur Methodology\nTo list the 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we extracted the stocks from the S&P 500 index. After getting the list, stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds were chosen. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holdings: 165\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) offers various products and platforms in the US, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Canada, and Latin America.\nDespite short-term challenges, Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s long-term outlook is positive. Its leadership in AI technology, together with a\u00a0diverse product portfolio, places it well for healthy growth. Analysts opine that continued AI integration throughout products, expansion of cloud services (primarily in AI and machine learning capabilities), YouTube\u2019s potential to tap a significant share of the shifting TV ad spend, and cost discipline and operational efficiencies are expected to act as potential growth drivers.\nWall Street analysts opine that AI advancements have aided other Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s properties, like YouTube, where ML algorithms tend to improve content recommendations and ad placements. Over the long term, AI integration should result in new product innovations and revenue streams. This should further solidify Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s position as a technology leader.\nThe growing importance of first-party data in a privacy-focused advertising ecosystem should fuel Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s growth prospects. Its extensive user data throughout various products enables precise targeting and measurement. This is valuable to advertisers because third-party cookies are phased out. Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s investments in AI and machine learning are placing it well to develop new ad formats and targeting capabilities that can offer increased ROI for advertisers.\nWedgewood Partners, an investment management company, published third-quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG).\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) also detracted from performance despite reporting strong +15% revenue growth (foreign exchange-neutral) in its core search business during the Company\u2019s second quarter. The Company continues to integrate generative AI (gen AI) applications into its largest products that reach billions of users every day. The advertisements that appear above and below this gen AI content, particularly on search results, represents a valuable opportunity for businesses. In addition, the Google subsidiary of Alphabet has been deploying gen AI features that help advertisers easily create ad content and then quickly scale that content across all of Google\u2019s properties and formats. As we have pointed out in the past, Google\u2019s new AI-driven advertising tools and products represent returns on the Company\u2019s early and aggressive investments in AI hardware and application software over the past decade and should lead to significant, sustainable competitive advantages. During the quarter, the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly in the U.S. across its search services and text advertising, specifically through exclusive distribution agreements. Alphabet\u2019s deep competitive advantages go far beyond its distribution agreements, and we believe the Company should be able to maintain its superior return structure, despite the recent legal headwinds.\u201d\nOverall, GOOG ranks 5th on our list of 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software.\n\u201cMicrosoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can\u2019t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,\u201d wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\nPersistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen.\nCEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark.

He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be \u201clikely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.\u201d\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u2019 quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well as the company\u2019s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday.\nStory Continues\nTo be sure, Big Tech companies\u2019 AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google\u2019s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on mega cap tech stocks Thursday.\nMeta said it expects \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.\"\nNvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Whether this Big Tech earnings season turns out to be a success or disappointment will likely come down to results from Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. later Thursday.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nChicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow\nIs Denver\u2019s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off?\nNY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link\nThere Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC\u2019s Historic Meatpacking District\nA South Korean City Plays Matchmaker to Tackle a Fertility Crisis\nThe earnings reports \u2014 the last from the so-called Magnificent Seven companies aside from Nvidia Corp. \u2014 come a day after results from Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. failed to impress investors, sending their shares lower and weighing on the broader market. That followed better-than-expected results from Alphabet Inc. on Tuesday and Tesla Inc. last week.\nStrong reports from Apple and Amazon.com could cement the narrative that the megacap tech group remains Wall Street\u2019s most reliable trade. Disappointments, coupled with the pair\u2019s index weight and multiples, could dash hopes of the market returning to record levels.\n\u201cThe bar is already very high simply because valuations are very high,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cInvestors have become accustomed to the Mag7 and tech and AI-related names not just beating forecasts but smashing them \u2014 and then raising guidance for the next quarter.\u201d\nInvestors are looking to Apple to at long last provide concrete information about demand for iPhones with artificial intelligence features, a product cycle investors are counting on to propel the company out of a low-growth era.\nAmazon\u2019s report will give insight into the state of the consumer with its e-commerce business, while results from its cloud-computing business will show any tailwind from AI, following similar reports from Alphabet and Microsoft.\nShares in Apple and Amazon have essentially kept pace with the market this year. Apple dipped 0.4% on Thursday while Amazon fell 1.3%. Microsoft dropped 4.6% while Meta fell 2.3%.\nThe stakes for Thursday\u2019s earnings reports from the pair have been raised after the market\u2019s negative reaction to Microsoft, which posted stronger-than-expected revenue growth, and Meta, which showed a sales beat.\nMicrosoft tumbled in US premarket trading Thursday after the software maker gave a disappointing forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business and reiterated higher spending to expand AI services. Meta slumped after flagging ramped up investment in AI and other futuristic technologies.\nStory Continues\nApple, in particular, could be vulnerable. Revenue is expected to grow less than 2% in its 2024 fiscal year, and while Wall Street sees that accelerating to 7.6% in fiscal 2025, that\u2019s well below other megacaps, which have consistently delivered double-digit growth. Yet, the company trades at 31 times estimated earnings, a premium of more than 50% over its 10-year average.\nWall Street has been growing cautious, especially amid signs of limited immediate interest in the AI iPhone. The stock has been downgraded twice this month, with both KeyBanc and Jefferies saying optimism has gotten excessive. Amazon received a rare downgrade of its own this month, as Wells Fargo Securities cited margin concerns that its cloud business may not be able to compensate for.\nAmazon shares could also be in a precarious position \u2014 the stock has clawed back losses following its August report, but remains below July highs. Alphabet\u2019s report could be seen as a good sign for Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud segment, as investors will also be watching for payoff from the company\u2019s heavy spending on artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWhat I heard on the Google call made me pretty optimistic,\u201d said Mark Malek, chief investment officer of Siebert Financial Corp. \u201cAssuming Amazon can talk similarly about the cloud, how they\u2019re monetizing and their clients, I think that is gonna be critical for them.\u201d\nAnalysts expect about $27.5 billion in AWS revenue in the quarter, up more than 19% on the year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. If Amazon misses those expectations, \u201cyou could see this narrative of AWS being a share loser in cloud infrastructure gain some steam,\u201d said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\nAmazon investors will also be watching margins closely \u2014 across its cloud and retail businesses \u2014 for signs of growth.\nAmazon needs to show \u201csome degree of positive momentum in margin improvement,\u201d said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management LLC. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve seen margins continue to move higher in AWS is a really very important point given that heavy infrastructure investment that they\u2019re making.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nMeta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg will ramp up heavy investments in AI and other futuristic technologies, continuing a years-long tug-of-war between the company\u2019s long-term bets and the core advertising business that provides the vast majority of Meta\u2019s revenue.\nMicrosoft Corp. shares dropped in late trading after the software maker forecast slower quarterly cloud revenue growth, reflecting the company\u2019s struggle to bring data centers online fast enough to keep up with demand for artificial intelligence services.\nMicroStrategy Inc. has hired banks to help it raise $42 billion through the sale of new shares and fixed income to buy more Bitcoin after a flurry of deals over the past year.\nSamsung Electronics Co. declared progress in supplying its most advanced AI memory chips to Nvidia Corp., seeking to reassure to investors who fear the company is falling further behind SK Hynix Inc. in a red-hot market.\nAndy Jassy kept prodding Alexa with sports questions. It was summer 2023, and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s chief executive officer wanted to see if a prototype of the voice assistant, upgraded with artificial intelligence, was good enough to compete with ChatGPT, the AI chatbot from OpenAI that had wowed the world around eight months earlier with its conversational wizardry.\nEarnings Due Thursday\nPremarket\nOpen Text\nArrow Electronics\nInsight Enterprises\nVontier Corp\nBelden\nItron\nAllegro MicroSystems\nInterDigital\nSolarWinds\nCoreCard\nComcast\nRoblox\nCinemark\nGannett Co\nClear Channel Outdoor\nMarcus Corp\nBandwidth\nPostmarket\nApple\nAmazon\nIntel\nAtlassian\nJuniper\nOnto Innovation Inc\nViavi\nCohu\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Jeran Wittenstein.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nHow Elon Musk Came to Embrace the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

The company rolled out a prototype of the product in July called SearchGPT, which was separate from its ChatGPT app and only available to a limited number of users.The new search capabilities, which use OpenAI\u2019s 4o model, will go live beginning with paid ChatGPT Plus and Team users on Thursday for mobile and web. OpenAI\u2019s enterprise and educational customers will be able to get access to the features in the coming weeks and free users sometime in the coming months. Following the viral success of ChatGPT in late 2022, tech companies raced to incorporate generative AI into a long list of services, including online search. OpenAI-backer Microsoft Corp. and Google have overhauled their search products to include more conversational AI features. Perplexity, a rival AI search startup, is now in early talks to raise funding at a $9 billion valuation, Bloomberg previously reported. With ChatGPT Search, OpenAI is poised to bring similar AI search functionality to the 250 million people who use the chatbot each week. Shares of Alphabet were down more than 1% Thursday following the news.\n\u201cPeople want answers when they search for things, and getting an answer is difficult on the internet right now. It takes multiple searches and you have to go through a bunch of links,\u201d Varun Shetty, head of media partnerships at OpenAI, said in an interview with Bloomberg News. \u201cWe think that being able to ask in a conversational way with all of that relevant context and high-quality sources on the other side just makes this a better experience.\u201d\nIn a demo ahead of the release, OpenAI\u2019s team used the feature to ask ChatGPT about weekend events in San Francisco. The app showed a summary list of activities pulled from local news websites. For a follow-up question about looking for restaurants, ChatGPT showed a map listing local eateries. While ChatGPT has previously included some citations in its responses, the new search feature shows summaries of sources and preview images more prominently.\nStory Continues\nOpenAI has laid the groundwork for its search offering through a growing number of licensing deals with publishers, including News Corp., Axel Springer SE, Time magazine as well as European media companies such as Le Monde. The partnerships allow OpenAI to include more authoritative, up-to-date information within its products. OpenAI said it incorporated feedback from publisher partners for ChatGPT Search about how the chatbot decides which articles are most relevant as well as determining the summary length and quotations for articles. \"We are convinced that AI search will be, in a near future and for the next generations, a primary way to access information, and partnering with OpenAI positions Le Monde at the forefront of this shift,\" Louis Dreyfus, chief executive officer of Le Monde, said in a statement.\nOpenAI said its tool won\u2019t preference news publishers who partnered with the company. Any website or publisher can choose to appear in ChatGPT Search, it said. The company also wants to ensure its search product is useful for people looking for information beyond hard news.\n\u201cSearch is such a broad space, and this is our first foray into it,\u201d Shetty said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to spend a lot of time improving the experiences and focusing on shopping, travel, local \u2014 all these verticals that are important.\u201d\nStill, as with all generative AI products, OpenAI must confront the risk that its new search tool could invent false answers to questions. After SearchGPT was introduced in July, for example, reporters noted that a demo for the product got the dates wrong for a festival.\nThe stakes are particularly high for OpenAI and its rivals to surface accurate information about the US election next week. Beginning on election day, OpenAI said ChatGPT users who ask about voting results will see a message encouraging them to check news sources like the Associated Press and Reuters, as well as their state or local election boards.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nHow Elon Musk Came to Embrace the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

The company is globally recognized as a leader in AI, leveraging its collaboration with OpenAI and developing AI resources for its consumers and business customers such as Copilot and Microsoft Azure.\nOn Tuesday, October 29, CNBC reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s most successful AI product, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to allow developers more choice in the models they want to use. GitHub stated in a blog post that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as substitutes for OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, if they wish.\n\u201cThere is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them. It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nTotal Q3 earnings for the 258 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Wednesday, October 30th, are up +8.9% on +5.0% higher revenues, with 74.4% beating EPS estimates and 59.3% beating revenue estimates.\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 258 index members that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.4% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues.\n2024 Q3 is the 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth (up +14.6%) for the Tech sector. Excluding the Tech sector's contribution, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +0.4%.\nQ3 earnings for the 'Magnificent 7' companies are expected to be up +20.1% from the same period last year on +14.0% higher revenues. This would follow the +35.2% earnings growth on +14.7% higher revenues in Q2. Excluding the 'Mag 7', Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be up +0.7%(vs. +4.4% otherwise).\nMagnificent 7 Earnings Impress\nThe market loved the Tesla TSLA report last week, with the EV-maker's release kicking off the Q3 reporting cycle for the Mag 7 group. At the headline level, Tesla modestly missed on revenues while handily beating consensus earnings estimates. In terms of the growth pace, Tesla's Q3 earnings were up +16.9% from the same period last year on +7.8% higher revenues.\nTesla shares have been the Mag 7 group's laggards this year, with the stock now up +5.4% after the roughly +20% post-release bounce. What excited Tesla investors is developments on the margins front, which expanded notably relative to other recent periods. While we don't know the specific drivers of this margin improvement, some believe that Q3 deliveries included an above-average proportion from the higher-margin Shanghai factory. In any case, the margin improvement is interpreted as a stabilization sign in the EV market's competitive pressures.\nStory Continues\nWe can confidently say that the Tesla report offers no read-throughs to the rest of the Mag 7 group. But that's not the case with Alphabet GOOGL, whose Q3 results were also cheered by the market. Sentiment on Alphabet had taken a hit since the July 23rd quarterly release, with investors increasingly uncomfortable with the company's ever-rising spending on building its artificial intelligence infrastructure.\nUnderpinning this worry about Alphabet's AI spending, which investors also have for other Mag 7 players, particularly Microsoft MSFT, has been management's inability to articulate how these investments will get monetized. It appears that they made that case in the Q3 release, with AI capabilities improving internal operating efficiencies and starting to drive growth.\nAlphabet's cloud revenues increased +35% in Q3, accelerating from Q2's +29% and Q1's +28% growth pace. Management credited AI capabilities for helping bring new clients and allowing for bigger contract wins. Management noted on the call that about a quarter of their code-writing activity was now AI-driven. Given how programming-heavy all of Alphabet's products are, this may be one of the most tangible examples of AI capabilities driving productivity gains.\nThe Mag 7 stocks ceded their market leadership role in recent months, likely reflecting a combination of valuation worries and investors' worries about ever-rising AI-centric capital expenditures, as noted in the context of Alphabet's results.\nOne could argue that the group will try to reclaim its market leadership role if the rest of the Mag 7 results mirror what we saw from Tesla and Alphabet.\nThe Q3 earnings results in the days ahead will provide these companies another opportunity to make the case. This is particularly significant for Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, though developments related to AI are relevant to all of them.\nThe market's current issues with the Mag 7 stocks notwithstanding, there is no escaping the fact that these mega-cap operators are enjoying sustainable profitability growth. These seven companies collectively are on track to bring in $116.1 billion in earnings in Q3 on $488.7 billion in revenues. This represents year-over-year earnings growth of +20.1% on +14.0% higher revenues.\nThe Mag 7 companies are on track to account for 21.7% of all S&P 500 earnings in Q3. In fact, had it not been for the Mag 7's substantial earnings contribution, Q3 earnings for the remaining S&P 500 index would be modestly in the negative territory.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are now expected to be up +4.4% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues.\nThe Q3 earnings growth pace would improve to +6.8% had it not been for the Energy sector drag (decline of -26.6% for Energy). On the other hand, quarterly earnings for the index would be up +0.4% once the Tech sector's hefty contribution is excluded (earnings growth of +14.6% for the Tech sector).\nThe quarterly earnings growth pace is expected to improve from next quarter onwards.\nFor the current period (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.7% on +5.2% higher revenues. Q4 earnings would be up +10.5% had it not been for the Energy sector drag.\nEstimates for the period have started coming down since the quarter got underway. Still, the pace and magnitude of negative revisions are less than we had seen in the comparable period of Q3.\nPlease note that this year's +7.3% earnings growth on only +1.9% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +6.3%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year's earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

But positive Q4 guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher by as much as 12% following the report.\nFor the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of 13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion.\nThat\u2019s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year.\nFor the fourth quarter, Intel said it expects revenue of between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $13.6 billion. The company also said it has two new customers for its 18A process.\nRevenue for the company's Datacenter and AI business came in at $3.35 billion analysts were looking for $3.1 billion.

Wall Street was looking for $4.4 billion.

In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success.\nIntel\u2019s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel\u2019s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short.\nIntel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that\u2019s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there\u2019s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they dipped slightly in Q3, according to Gartner.\nThe company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel\u2019s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years.\nStory Continues\nFILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023.

Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before.\nQualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\"Short-term artificial intelligence supply issues are likely to maintain stable Azure consumption trends in Q2 compared to Q1, which is solid but not a new catalyst,\" Barclays said. The company maintained its Overweight rating and $475 price target.\nMicrosoft revealed in Q1 2025 16% year-over-year sales increase. Nonetheless, According to Stone Fox Capital, investors feel the stock is fairly priced at 32 times FY25 earnings. Moreover, investors led by Mark Murphy at J.P. Morgan confirmed an Overweight rating and marginally changed their price target to $465. Murphy mentioned Azure's expected acceleration in the second half as a main driver, but he also pointed out that Microsoft's direction below Q2 consensusparticularly in terms of gaming and device salescould dampen near-term sentiment. Under Brent Thill's direction, Jefferies analysts kept a Buy rating and a $550 price target, underscoring Microsoft's consistency in revenue projections, as shown in nine of the last ten quarters. Maintaining its Outperform rating and a $500 target, Evercore ISI also advised the stock, seeing the recent fall as a good entry point for long-term investors.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Furthermore, the data on Inflation published by the Federal Reserve stated that the PCE price index was up to 0.2% for September, while the core PCE rate was slightly higher than expected at 2.7%.

Available through the company\u2019s ChatGPT website and via its Android and iOS apps, the search platform stands as the biggest potential threat to Google\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) search dominance in years.\nShares of Google parent Alphabet were off 1.5% following the news, roughly in line with the rest of the tech sector, which saw declines on concerns about the industry\u2019s spending on AI infrastructure and uptake from customers.\nOpenAI announced it was testing a temporary prototype search service in July, and this is the result of those tests. The Microsoft-backed (MSFT) company says in addition to pulling general information from the web, the search platform will also offer up content for weather, sports, stocks, news, and maps.\nThe search platform, the company says, runs on its GPT-4o model and also leverages information from third-party search providers and partners that have signed data-sharing agreements with OpenAI.\nAn example of how results will appear in OpenAI's ChatGPT search service. (Image: OpenAI) \u00b7 OpenAI\nOpenAI says that its search service will cut down on the need to perform multiple searches for your queries by asking questions in a conversational way and then following up on those answers.\nThe company also says users will be able to use ChatGPT as the default search engine in Google\u2019s Chrome browser by downloading and installing its Chrome extension.\nFor now, ChatGPT search is only available to ChatGPT Plus and Team users and folks who signed up for the SearchGPT waitlist. Enterprise and education users will be able to use the service in the coming weeks, while free users will get access in the coming months.\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nGPT search poses a potentially enormous threat to Google, which generates the vast majority of its revenue via its search advertising service. And the danger couldn\u2019t come at a worse time. Google is already battling two antitrust suits related to its search and advertising dominance, and adding a new challenger to the list of troubles is sure to sting.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that ChatGPT was one of the fastest-growing apps ever, and that it continues to remain popular among users. By adding generative AI-powered search to its arsenal, it\u2019s becoming a much bigger thorn in Google\u2019s side.\nOf course, the tech giant still maintains an incredible 90% market share, according to data from StatCounter. The next closest competitor, Bing, has just 3.96% of the market. The company isn\u2019t hurting financially, either. In its most recent quarter, advertising revenue came in at $65.8 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $65.5 billion and increasing from $59.6 billion in the same quarter last year.\nStory Continues\nGoogle also isn\u2019t sitting idly by on the AI front: The company already offers its own AI Overviews feature, which incorporates generative AI responses to users\u2019 search queries in addition to the normal list of blue link results.\nMicrosoft has also tried to take on Google's search business by adding OpenAI's generative AI capabilities to its Bing search engine, but that hasn't done much to pull at Google's search lead.\nStill, if OpenAI's GPT search can outperform Google when it comes to consumers' search results, it could start to put a dent in Google's defenses.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell over 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 2.7%, while Intel and Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped roughly 3% and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 4.5%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged nearly 9%.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMicrosoft (MSFT) in its earnings report late Wednesday indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from \u201cthird parties\u201d hindered the growth of its AI cloud business in its 2025 fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software.\n\u201cMicrosoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can\u2019t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,\u201d wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\nPersistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen.\nCEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN via Getty Images\n\u201c[A]s long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow\u2026the growth in CapEx will slow and the revenue growth will increase,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.\u201d\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG) in its third quarter earnings report said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. \u201cAs we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,\u201d said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company\u2019s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be \u201clikely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.\u201d\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u2019 quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well as the company\u2019s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday.\nStory Continues\nTo be sure, Big Tech companies\u2019 AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google\u2019s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on mega cap tech stocks Thursday.\nMeta said it expects \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.\"\nNvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20.

While growth in Microsoft Azure (cloud segment) grew 34%, the company anticipated a slight deceleration in the next quarter (Q2'25) due to supply chain issues, including delays in third-party infrastructure for AI capabilities. However, management reassured that there will be normalization in the second half of the fiscal year.\nAlso, margins came under pressure during the quarter. This could be attributed to the ongoing investments to stay ahead in the AI race. The margin pressure is also partly due to weaknesses in areas like gaming and cloud, and the timing of revenue recognition and integration costs from the acquisition of Activision.\nLastly, we note that changes in how the company reports segments led to large segment beats and misses that investors should largely ignore. Consolidated numbers matter much more this quarter given the segment noise, and on that note, revenue and EPS beat expectations this quarter. This was an uninspiring quarter, with mixed guidance weighing on shares.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Microsoft? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nMicrosoft\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 7 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nMicrosoft is up 10.2% since the beginning of the year, but at $408.50 per share, it is still trading 12.6% below its 52-week high of $467.56 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Microsoft\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,849.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Whether this Big Tech earnings season turns out to be a success or disappointment will likely come down to results from Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. later Thursday.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nChicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow\nIs Denver\u2019s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off?\nNY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link\nThere Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC\u2019s Historic Meatpacking District\nA South Korean City Plays Matchmaker to Tackle a Fertility Crisis\nThe earnings reports \u2014 the last from the so-called Magnificent Seven companies aside from Nvidia Corp. \u2014 come a day after results from Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. failed to impress investors, sending their shares lower and weighing on the broader market. That followed better-than-expected results from Alphabet Inc. on Tuesday and Tesla Inc. last week.\nStrong reports from Apple and Amazon.com could cement the narrative that the megacap tech group remains Wall Street\u2019s most reliable trade. Disappointments, coupled with the pair\u2019s index weight and multiples, could dash hopes of the market returning to record levels.\n\u201cThe bar is already very high simply because valuations are very high,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cInvestors have become accustomed to the Mag7 and tech and AI-related names not just beating forecasts but smashing them \u2014 and then raising guidance for the next quarter.\u201d\nInvestors are looking to Apple to at long last provide concrete information about demand for iPhones with artificial intelligence features, a product cycle investors are counting on to propel the company out of a low-growth era.\nAmazon\u2019s report will give insight into the state of the consumer with its e-commerce business, while results from its cloud-computing business will show any tailwind from AI, following similar reports from Alphabet and Microsoft.\nShares in Apple and Amazon have essentially kept pace with the market this year. Apple dipped 0.4% on Thursday while Amazon fell 1.3%. Microsoft dropped 4.6% while Meta fell 2.3%.\nThe stakes for Thursday\u2019s earnings reports from the pair have been raised after the market\u2019s negative reaction to Microsoft, which posted stronger-than-expected revenue growth, and Meta, which showed a sales beat.\nMicrosoft tumbled in US premarket trading Thursday after the software maker gave a disappointing forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business and reiterated higher spending to expand AI services. Meta slumped after flagging ramped up investment in AI and other futuristic technologies.\nStory Continues\nApple, in particular, could be vulnerable. Revenue is expected to grow less than 2% in its 2024 fiscal year, and while Wall Street sees that accelerating to 7.6% in fiscal 2025, that\u2019s well below other megacaps, which have consistently delivered double-digit growth. Yet, the company trades at 31 times estimated earnings, a premium of more than 50% over its 10-year average.\nWall Street has been growing cautious, especially amid signs of limited immediate interest in the AI iPhone. The stock has been downgraded twice this month, with both KeyBanc and Jefferies saying optimism has gotten excessive. Amazon received a rare downgrade of its own this month, as Wells Fargo Securities cited margin concerns that its cloud business may not be able to compensate for.\nAmazon shares could also be in a precarious position \u2014 the stock has clawed back losses following its August report, but remains below July highs. Alphabet\u2019s report could be seen as a good sign for Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud segment, as investors will also be watching for payoff from the company\u2019s heavy spending on artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWhat I heard on the Google call made me pretty optimistic,\u201d said Mark Malek, chief investment officer of Siebert Financial Corp. \u201cAssuming Amazon can talk similarly about the cloud, how they\u2019re monetizing and their clients, I think that is gonna be critical for them.\u201d\nAnalysts expect about $27.5 billion in AWS revenue in the quarter, up more than 19% on the year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. If Amazon misses those expectations, \u201cyou could see this narrative of AWS being a share loser in cloud infrastructure gain some steam,\u201d said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\nAmazon investors will also be watching margins closely \u2014 across its cloud and retail businesses \u2014 for signs of growth.\nAmazon needs to show \u201csome degree of positive momentum in margin improvement,\u201d said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management LLC. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve seen margins continue to move higher in AWS is a really very important point given that heavy infrastructure investment that they\u2019re making.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nMeta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg will ramp up heavy investments in AI and other futuristic technologies, continuing a years-long tug-of-war between the company\u2019s long-term bets and the core advertising business that provides the vast majority of Meta\u2019s revenue.\nMicrosoft Corp. shares dropped in late trading after the software maker forecast slower quarterly cloud revenue growth, reflecting the company\u2019s struggle to bring data centers online fast enough to keep up with demand for artificial intelligence services.\nMicroStrategy Inc. has hired banks to help it raise $42 billion through the sale of new shares and fixed income to buy more Bitcoin after a flurry of deals over the past year.\nSamsung Electronics Co. declared progress in supplying its most advanced AI memory chips to Nvidia Corp., seeking to reassure to investors who fear the company is falling further behind SK Hynix Inc. in a red-hot market.\nAndy Jassy kept prodding Alexa with sports questions.

          "whole_article": "Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks tumbled Thursday as investors weighed the tech giants' hefty, ever-increasing AI bills.\nMeta sank 4%, while Microsoft dropped 6%. In their quarterly earnings reports released the night before, both companies beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue, but investors appeared spooked as executives said in calls with analysts that they expect capital expenditures to continue increasing.\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe mood weighed on other Big Tech names, including Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which are set to wrap up megacaps' earnings week on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also stumbled, with its stock down 4.7% at market close.\nBig Tech firms' capital expenditures in recent quarters have been largely driven by their investments in generative artificial intelligence infrastructure, such as AI chips. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion during its 2025 fiscal first quarter, while Meta\u2019s expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period (its 2024 fiscal third quarter).\nMeta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li said the company expects \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.\"\nFor its part, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company expects capital expenditures to increase in the current quarter as the company ramps up investments in AI hardware in response to \"AI demand signals,\" which she said will weigh on its gross margins. The company gave a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for its fiscal second quarter (the current period).\nMicrosoft's softer second quarter guidance came in part due to capacity constraints, as it faces delayed deliveries of AI chips to power data centers on which it runs its AI software, rather than any slowdown in demand, analysts noted Thursday.\nCEO Satya Nadella said Wednesday, \"We have run into obviously lots of external constraints because this demand all showed up pretty fast, right?\"\nWhile investors have expressed concerns about a disconnect between Big Tech firms' AI spending and actual demand from consumers for its AI products, both Microsoft and Meta signaled that demand is real, and Wall Street analysts largely agreed.\nMeta said it\u2019s seeing \"rapid adoption of Meta AI.\"\n\"We are very optimistic about the set of opportunities in front of us and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will not only accelerate our progress but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each area,\" Li said.\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's Hood noted that the company's motivation for AI spending is linked to \u201cgrowing demand\u201d for its AI products in the present, and she expects Microsoft\u2019s cloud division sales to accelerate in the second half of its fiscal year 2025 as \u201ccapital investments create an increase in available AI capacity.\u201d\nHood added, \u201cRoughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.\"\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Seattle, Washington, on May 21, 2024. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 JASON REDMOND via Getty Images\nFor their part, Wall Street analysts came away with mostly positive sentiments on the companies' performance in the AI space, with the vast majority reiterating their Buy ratings on the stocks Thursday, according to Bloomberg data.\nDeutsche Bank analysts said in a note Thursday that they see Meta's AI investments already paying off.\n\"To us, it is becoming increasingly evident that the scaled investments in core AI (and Gen AI) are having a tangible positive impact on advertising performance, driving an ever-widening gap between Meta and its peers,\" they wrote.\nIn a separate note, Deutsche Bank analysts said they see \"Microsoft delivering significant AI value for customers.\"\n\"At a high level, the AI business is on track to exceed a $10 billion run rate next quarter after just 2.5 years, making it the fastest in company history to achieve this milestone and in fairness likely the most capital intensive,\" they said.\nRBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria reiterated the firm's bullishness on the stock: \u201cWhile investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness.\"\nMeanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors: \"We come away from this quarter more bullish (not less) after seeing this AI growth and Copilot monetization play out in real time for Microsoft.\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

He said that firms depend heavily on big technology companies for computing power and the ability to deal with large data sets related to AI.

He added that a lot of time and effort would be freed up when there is a set of regulator-approved control standards for the industry.\nYue said banks are required to conduct risk assessments of AI service providers to strengthen their operational resilience and must have in place contingency plans to address potential service disruptions caused by third parties.\nStory Continues\nThese \"basic, common sense\" moves are essential to better safeguard companies and other institutions, said James Elwes, HSBC's chief information officer for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"[Third-party risk management] starts with simply identifying where your concentration risk is and documenting that,\" he said. \"If you've not done that, you're not going to do any of the next steps that are important.\"\nVendor diversification could help to solve some issues, Elwes said, but he added that big tech companies are often the most well-equipped to be third-party service providers.\n\"There are benefits to concentration simply because of the nature of some of these organisations - the scale they can provide and the investment they can put in,\" he said.\n\"So a degree of concentration on vendors, especially within technology, is likely to remain.\"\nSarah Breeden, deputy governor at the Bank of England, said in a pre-recorded speech that financial institutions are expected to have a \"stronger and more rigorous\" grasp of AI as they increase their dependence on it for \"higher impact areas of their businesses.\" These areas include credit risk assessment, capital management and algorithmic trading.\nHong Kong's government unveiled its first guidelines on the responsible use of AI on Monday.

          "whole_article": "We recently made a list of Jefferies\u2019 Top Crowded Software Short Positions: Top 9 Stocks. In this piece, we will take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks on the list of crowded software short positions.\nWith the close of 2024 approaching fast, artificial intelligence continues to set the narrative on Wall Street. The tail end of October marks the start of another highly anticipated earnings season, which for the most part, will continue to be dominated by AI. On the hardware front, investors will be on the lookout for whether the demand for AI GPUs is sustaining and if the firm that is the market leader is also improving its margins and profitability. For software stocks, investors will pour over profitability data to determine whether the billions of dollars invested in training and testing AI as well as in business partnerships are yielding results.\nFor software stocks, their exposure to AI is so strong that it has divided the 2024 stock performance of some firms into neat halves determined by investor sentiment about their AI products. One such AI software stock ranked 5th on our recent list of AI stocks that insiders are selling. Looking at its year-to-date share price performance, it\u2019s rather neatly divided into two halves that converge on June 13th. Year to date on June 13th, the shares were down 19.8% even though the firm\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenue was a cool $19.4 billion and had grown by 10% annually. Before that eventful day, the firm\u2019s first quarter had seen it grow revenue by 11% annually but struggle to keep costs low and profit margins high.\nYet, the investor bearishness surrounding this well-known provider of productivity software tools such as Photoshop and Reader, would change in the blink of an eye. From June 13th to the third week of October, the shares have reversed course and gained 8.5%. In fact, between the 13th and September 12th, the stock had gained 27.9%. June 13th was the day that this firm reported its second-quarter earnings. The results led to its shares jumping by 13% in aftermarket trading, with investors impressed by the fact that the firm increased full-year guidance to range between $21.40 billion and $21.50 billion from an earlier $21.30 billion $21.50 billion.\nThe optimism was driven in part by the firm\u2019s Creative Cloud business which includes products such as Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, and Express. The AI addition to Creative Cloud was the firm\u2019s set of generative AI models dubbed Firefly. Management shared that Firefly was at the heart of the ARR guidance bump to $1.95 billion as they shared:\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the Digital Media business and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services and Express. We\u2019re pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half.\u201d\nWith AI profitability driving the second-quarter earnings season, investors were naturally ecstatic and sent the stock higher.\nHowever, the June respite would be short-lived as the shares tanked by 13.4% in September. As usual, AI was the culprit. The downward trend started in the form of a 9.2% drop in after-market following the firm\u2019s third-quarter report. It saw the company guide Q4 revenue at a midpoint of $5.525 billion which fell below the $5.61 billion analyst consensus.\nWhile this firm is a consumer and professional software stock, the broader software as a service (SaaS) industry hasn\u2019t been spared by the AI-driven Wall Street trends either. SaaS and software stocks are predominantly valued through two metrics: the Rule of 40 and EV/Sales (or variants such as EV/EBITDA or Price to Sales). These multiples are somewhat unique to the software and SaaS stock narrative as they evaluate the firms based on their ability to grow. This is key since one of the main reasons behind SaaS stock popularity is that they do not have to deal with inventory, logistics, or supply chain issues like other businesses.\nIn the AI era, SaaS valuation multiples and revenue growth estimates have been severely compressed. Data shows that the median price to forward sales SaaS multiple is 5.5x right now. The valuations are driven by lower growth expectations. After AI and the decimation ushered in by high interest rates, just 1% of SaaS and software companies have a 12-month future revenue growth rate higher than 30% as of June 2024. Digging deeper, investors have also placed a higher premium on growth as while firms with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 have a median EV/Sales multiple of 8.9x, those with a growth rate greater than 30% but a Rule of 40 score lesser than 40 have a median multiple of 11.6x.\nThese AI-driven software shifts, precipitated by worries of a reduction in SaaS demand due to businesses self-developing software using AI have also affected investor sentiment. According to Jefferies\u2019 latest Trading Positioning Survey, 19% of institutional investors were overweight on software stocks as of October 2024, a sharp drop over July\u2019s reading of 28% and January\u2019s 51%. Yet, investors have also tempered their short positions as Jefferies shows that 54 software stocks were shorted as of October compared to 73 in July.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software short positions, we ranked the top nine crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a well-known cybersecurity software provider that rose to fame earlier this year after its faulty software update led to an unbelievable 8.5 million computers going offline worldwide. The outage also flipped the firm\u2019s narrative, as the shares lost more than 42% of their value over the next two weeks. However, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has managed to control some of the damage from the outage as its shares are up 24.9% year to date and 41.6% since the post-outage bottom. Part of the recovery is based on easing investor worries of customer loss as CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) might be able to prevent fallout due to high switching costs. Investors will nevertheless be on the watchout for customers jumping ship, and they will also monitor CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s fiscal 2031 recurring revenue guidance of $10 billion and midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of crowded software shorts according to Jefferies.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $982.26 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25%. The $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +27.5% and +22.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(CRWD) Rebounds Amid Post-Outage Challenges\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity software products provider that made headlines earlier this year due to a faulty software update that caused one of the biggest software outages in history. The outage affected an unbelievable 8.5 million computers worldwide, and it is now shaping CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s narrative as well. While the shares are up by 42% since the post-outage bottom, compared to the pre-outage peak, they are still down 20.8%. Investors are waiting to see whether the reputational impacts from the outage might lead businesses to not renew their contracts with CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s Falcon system. As for the firm, it is still targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by its fiscal year 2031 and a midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%. Consequently, investors will be combing CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s upcoming earnings with a fine-toothed comb to see if customer sentiment has weakened to make meeting these guidelines difficult.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

          "whole_article": "By David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said on Monday it sued Delta Air Lines in U.S. District Court in Georgia after a faulty software update prompted a global outage in July.\nThe July 19 incident led to worldwide flight cancellations and hit industries including banks, healthcare, media companies and hotel chains.\nCrowdStrike said it sued to make clear that CrowdStrike did not cause the harm that Delta claims, and that Delta repeatedly refused assistance from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. Delta did not immediately comment on CrowdStrike's suit.\nCrowdStrike is seeking a declaratory judgment plus legal fees.\nDelta's lawsuit filed on Friday in Fulton County Superior Court called the faulty software update from CrowdStrike \"catastrophic\" and said the company \"forced untested and faulty updates to its customers, causing more than 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to crash.\"\nDelta said the faulty update caused 7,000 flight cancellations, disrupted travel plans of 1.3 million customers and cost the carrier more than $500 million.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit, also filed on Friday, said Delta's own response and technology caused delays in the carrier's ability to resume normal operations.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit reiterated its contention that it has minimal liability, something Delta rejected.\nDelta said CrowdStrike is liable for over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses as well as for unspecified lost profits, expenditures - including legal fees - reputational harm and future revenue loss.\nThe incident prompted the U.S. Transportation Department to open an investigation.\n\"If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed,\" Delta's lawsuit says.\nDelta said it has invested billions of dollars in information technology licensing and infrastructure.\nLast month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologized before Congress for the faulty software update.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nIn a recent Tech Check program, CNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI\u2019s head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries.\nAs reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide \u201cmathematically precise and reproducible answers\u201d by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations.\n\u201cThink of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data \u2014 cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result\u201d.\nDespite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly \u201challucinating\u201d. OpenAI may deem it to have near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy\u201d, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments. A University of Michigan researcher found hallucinations in 80% of the audio transcriptions he examined during a study of public meetings.\nStory Continues\nSuch mistakes could have \u201creally grave consequences,\u201d particularly in hospital settings\u2026Nobody wants a misdiagnosis\u201d and that \u201cThere should be a higher bar.\u201d\nWith that, let's look at the 15 recent AI news that nobody should miss.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) Faces Lawsuit from Delta Airlines, Allegations of \u201cUntested\u201d Software Update Causing $500 Million in Losses\nPixabay/Public Domain\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a global cybersecurity company offering cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data. It employs world-class AI and ML to detect and prevent modern threats with the speed and scale of the cloud. Its generative AI security platform Charlotte AI has also gained significant traction.\nOn October 25, CNBC reported that Delta Airlines has sued CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in a Georgia state court following a global outage in July, leading to widespread flight cancellations and disruptions of travel plans that cost the airline over $500 million.\nA CrowdStrike spokesperson told CNBC:\n\"While we aimed to reach a business resolution that puts customers first, Delta has chosen a different path. Delta\u2019s claims are based on disproven misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.\"\nOverall CRWD ranks 9th\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Non-fuel expenses amounted to $170 million, while fuel costs were $50 million lower than they would have been had the flights not been cancelled. Third-quarter per-share profit was also dented by $0.45.\n\"Because the faulty update could not be removed remotely, CrowdStrike crippled Delta's business and created immense delays for Delta customers,\" the airline said in its lawsuit.\nAmid the fallout from the outage, Delta brought on David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner to seek damages from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft, including compensation for losses and litigation expenses related to the matter.\nIn a statement late on Friday cited by Reuters, CrowdStrike said Delta's claims were based on \"disproven misinformation\" and \"demostrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works.\" The lawsuit was a \"desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure,\" CrowdStrike added.\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\nRelated Articles\nCrowdStrike shares slightly lower premarket amid Delta lawsuit over summer outage\nMorgan Stanley explains why rates are rising\nEuropean shares gain as key data and US tech earnings loom\nView Comments"

But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\nCheck out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhat's The Opportunity In CrowdStrike Holdings?\nGreat news for investors \u2013 CrowdStrike Holdings is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $420.23, but it is currently trading at US$301 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from CrowdStrike Holdings?\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. CrowdStrike Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRWD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CRWD for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy CRWD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nStory Continues\nIf you want to dive deeper into CrowdStrike Holdings, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software.\n\u201cMicrosoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can\u2019t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,\u201d wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\nPersistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen.\nCEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark.

The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the BofA's List Of AI & Semiconductor Stocks That Fund Managers Love & Hate: 16 Stocks On The Manager Radar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate.\nThe initial wave of artificial intelligence investing has shaken up the stock market. Suddenly, technology stocks are divided between those that have exposure to AI and those that don't. The former category has soared to set records while the latter has been lackluster because of the state of sluggishness in the non-AI business world.\nWithin AI stocks that have outdone themselves, semiconductor stocks are a standout. Additionally, just as is the case with broader technology stocks, semiconductor stocks are also divided between those with AI and non-AI exposure. The best example of the former category is Wall Street's top AI stock pick. This stock is of a firm that designs and sells GPUs used to process AI workloads. Its shares are up 845% since the 2023 start and have set multiple records since OpenAI's Chat GPT became publicly available.\nOn the flip side, another semiconductor stock has floundered during the same period even though it's one of the oldest and largest semiconductor companies in the world. This stock belongs to a firm that is also one of the only three companies in the world that can manufacture high-end semiconductors and it is the only one which is headquartered in the US. While the GPU designer's shares have gained 845%, over the same time, this semiconductor stock is down 13.9%, and year to date the shares have bled an unbelievable 53.14%.\nTherein lies the bifurcation between semiconductor stocks that is fueled by the artificial intelligence wave. However, these returns might belong to the first stage of AI stocks only, implying that other semiconductor companies could also see gains provided robust AI software demand and the ability of firms to monetize their products.\u00a0 We covered a lot of such potential stocks as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks.\nIn this list, there were five semiconductor stocks. Four of these are semiconductor manufacturers while the remaining stock is the firm whose designs are the backbone of the modern-day smartphone industry. The stocks are ranked 19th, 16th, 14th, 8th, and 6th. Looking at their year-to-date performance, these stocks are up roughly 45%, 51.7%, 65.7%, 97.8%, and 122% year-to-date, respectively. Safe to say, the AI wave has been kind to these stocks. The next step in our brief analysis is to see what analysts believe the future holds for these firms. To do this, one particularly useful ratio is the forward price to earnings since it gauges the current price to analyst estimates of future earnings.\nStory Continues\nFor these five phase two AI semiconductor stocks, the forward P/E ratios in respective orders are roughly 31.25, 50.51, 29.41, 25.19, and 99 times. The forward P/E ratio for global and US semiconductor stocks is 45.77 so most of these stocks are fairly valued. Consequently, this implies that in case of an AI correction that sees investor sentiment evaporate for any reason, these stocks might not be hit as hard as those speculating about an 'AI bubble' might worry, but if Wall Street finds more reasons to add to its AI euphoria, then their valuation might further bloom for more gains.\nShifting gears, the average forward P/E ratio for the semiconductor industry also leads us to wonder which stocks are driving this average value higher. After all, the six AI chip stocks we've covered above include some of the biggest companies in the world. However, high P/E ratios commonly belong to smaller companies that earn small profits but have a much higher share price. Two stocks that we've identified that have at least 2x the average forward P/E ratio are both unprofitable right now. The one with the higher forward P/E ratio of 196.08 ranks 20th on our list of Piper Sandler\u2019s Top Technical Stock Picks: 20 Best Stocks while the second with a beefy ratio of 133.33 ranked 32nd on this list of AI stocks that were recently trending.\nSo, the next question to ask is, what makes these stocks so special that despite the fact that neither is currently profitable, investors have valued their shares more than 100 times over their projected earnings? Well, starting from the first stock with the higher P/E ratio, this firm is one of the few hardened integrated circuit manufacturers in the US. It makes radiation-resistant chips for the US military and its tools enable chip designs at various nodes. The second stock, which is up 49% year to date, is a specialty chip manufacturer that makes and sells silicon-based timing devices as an alternative to quartz-based products. These are used in applications such as edge computing and 5G networks - systems that are closer to end users and therefore must endure more strenuous working environments.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of semiconductor stocks that fund managers love and hate according to BofA, we used its recent list of semiconductor stocks that were popular or losing popularity with fund managers. The list was divided into two sections based on expansion or decline in ownership.\u00a0 Stocks within each category were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. For an interesting exercise, you can also compare these stocks with those on our lists of Goldman Sachs\u2019 List Of Stocks That Hedge & Mutual Funds Love & Hate: 28 Stocks On The Mutual and Hedge Funds Radar.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 130\nSection: Gaining Popularity\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a diversified technology company with a presence in the semiconductor and SaaS industries. It has exposure to the semiconductor industry via modems, network controllers, network processors, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These allow Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) products to operate in the smartphone, laptop, and data center industries. The firm also benefits from its ASIC business as it allows it to. work with companies interested in designing their custom AI chips. Consequently, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0 has a wide semiconductor moat which allows it to profit from several industries. Its cybersecurity business adds margin-heavy revenue to the income statement, making Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) one of the most well-rounded firms in the world. However, with Apple's propensity to shift to its in-house chips, the firm could see headwinds in the future if Apple decides to self-design and make chips such as MacBook WiFi modules.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the UBS' Top Tech Based Disruptive Stocks For 2030: Top 29 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

OpenAI has been planning a custom chip and working on such uses for the technology for around a year, the people said, but the discussions are still at an early stage.\nOpenAI declined to comment. A representative for Broadcom didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and a TSMC spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on rumors and speculation. Reuters reported on OpenAI\u2019s ongoing talks with Broadcom and TSMC on Tuesday. The Information reported in June that Broadcom had discussed making an AI chip for OpenAI.\nThe process for taking a chip from design to production is long and expensive. OpenAI is less focused on graphics processing units, chips that are used to train and build generative AI models \u2014 a market that has been cornered by Nvidia Corp. Instead, it\u2019s looking for a specialized chip that will run the software and respond to user requests, a process called inference. Investors and analysts expect the need for chips to support inference will only grow as more tech companies use AI models to field more complex tasks.\nOpenAI may continue to research setting up its own network of foundries, or chip factories, one of the people said, but the startup has realized that working with partners on custom chips is a quicker, attainable path for now. Reuters earlier reported that OpenAI was pulling back from the effort of establishing its own chip manufacturing capacity.\nBroadcom shares closed up 4.2% to $179.24 in New York trading on Tuesday. Even before the latest gain, they were up 54% this year. TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares closed more than 1% higher.\nBroadcom is the largest designer of application-specific integrated circuits \u2014 chips designed to fit a single purpose specified by the customer. The company\u2019s biggest customer in this area is Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Broadcom also works with Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\nStory Continues\nWhen asked last month whether he has new customers for the business, given the huge demand for AI training, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that he will only add to his short list of customers when projects hit volume shipments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy product to deploy for any customer, and so we do not consider proof of concepts as production volume,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call.\nOpenAI\u2019s services require massive amounts of computing power to develop and run \u2014 with much of that coming from Nvidia chips. To meet the demand, the industry has been scrambling to find alternatives to Nvidia. That\u2019s included embracing processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and developing in-house versions.\nOpenAI is also actively planning investments and partnerships in data centers, the eventual home for such AI chips. The startup\u2019s leadership has pitched the US government on the need for more massive data centers and CEO Sam Altman has sounded out global investors, including some in the Middle East, to finance the effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stretch,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told Bloomberg Television on Monday. \u201cStretch from a capital perspective but also my own learning.

          "whole_article": "OpenAI is reportedly embarking on a new chapter in its artificial intelligence development journey\u2014it's building its own in-house chip.\nAccording to Reuters, which cited exclusive sources close to the company, OpenAI is collaborating with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to diversify its supply chain and control infrastructure costs as it seeks to keep up with the immense computational needs of AI.\nWhile OpenAI had previously considered building its own chip manufacturing foundries, the high costs and lengthy timeline led the company to prioritize in-house chip design. Currently, OpenAI has assembled a team of roughly 20 chip engineers, including experts with experience designing Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Together, they hope to develop OpenAI's first custom chip by 2026\u2014though that timeline is flexible.\nThe news on Tuesday sent Broadcom Inc. shares up 4% and TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares gained more than 1%.\nThe move reflects OpenAI's ongoing strategy to secure consistent chip supply and manage escalating costs, a challenge that other tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft have also faced in their AI ventures. This effort includes OpenAI\u2019s recent decision to integrate AMD chips, along with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, which continue to dominate the market but are in limited supply. In fact, tech giants have been literally begging Nvidia for more chips.\nAt a meeting with analysts last month, billionaire\u00a0Oracle\u00a0cofounder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said he and world\u2019s-richest-man Elon Musk took Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang out to dinner at\u00a0Nobu\u00a0Palo Alto and \u201cbegged\u201d for more GPUs.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The market for ServiceNow, Inc.'s (NYSE:NOW) shares didn't move much after it posted weak earnings recently. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nSee our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-history\nZooming In On ServiceNow's Earnings\nOne key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.\nServiceNow has an accrual ratio of -0.40 for the year to September 2024. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$3.4b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$1.34b. ServiceNow shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On ServiceNow's Profit Performance\nAs we discussed above, ServiceNow's accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is a positive for the company. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that ServiceNow's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at an extremely impressive rate over the last three years. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing ServiceNow at this point in time. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for ServiceNow and you'll want to know about these.\nStory Continues\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of ServiceNow's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "Bill McDermott is very intense.\u00a0When he first joined ServiceNow as CEO in 2019\u2014he was previously CEO of SAP\u2014he met all 7,000 employees and shook hands with every single one of them.\n\u201cIn the first hundred days I was here, I travelled the whole world. The whole world. I met every single person that works for this company in person, and shook their hand.\u201d\nHandshake intensity is a thing, in McDermott's world.\nThe first handshake is incredibly important, he says. It\u2019s part of his mindset, especially for dealing with clients. He advises sales people, upon entering a room with a prospective client, to \u201cfind the decision-maker and shake his hand, but be the last one to let go.\u201d\nHe spoke to Fortune recently in a penthouse suite at the Four Seasons hotel in London, during a business trip to meet clients.\nQuestion 1: Does this handshake thing really work?\n\u201cYes, it does.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not a perfunctory exercise to greet somebody. It's not a perfunctory exercise to shake somebody's hand. They have to know you're in the room and you have to let them know that you care,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo just to shake hands as if it's just some standard thing to do is not enough.\u201d\n(So, was my handshake any good? \u201cYou were fine. I wasn't judging you.\u201d)\nMcDermott\u2019s stewardship of ServiceNow is certainly working. Five years later, ServiceNow has 26,000 employees, revenues of $2.8 billion per quarter and a market cap of more than $195 billion.\nThe AI-driven enterprise software company counts clients such as IBM, KPMG, and Deloitte, for whom it provides a vast range of back-end software that handles customer service, IT operations, security, and new employee on-boarding, among dozens of other services.\nThe handshake thing is a good example of McDermott\u2019s intense, driven style. This is a man who only sleeps for five hours a night. He wakes up at 5 a.m., reads three newspapers, drinks an espresso, does a light workout and walks his dog, Amber. He\u2019s in the office by 8 a.m. He usually continues working until 11 p.m. at night.\nQuestion 2: Can you really get by on just five hours\u2019 sleep?\n\u201cFive hours a night, you know, which is fine,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the week, you know, like it's \u2018go time.\u2019\u201d\nHe sleeps a bit more on weekends.\nQuestion 3: Does ServiceNow have supply issues with Nvidia?\nMost products offered by ServiceNow are driven by AI.\nSo is he getting what he needs from Nvidia, the AI chipmaker that has been accused of not being able to meet demand for all its customers?\n\u201cPerhaps we're fortunate because we have such a strategic relationship but Nvidia has fulfilled all of our requirements and done a great job,\u201d he says.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe started building models with Jensen [Huang, the CEO] several years ago, and we were the first mover in enterprise software building with Nvidia's GPU stack.\u201d\nQuestion 4: Will you cave to Robby Starbuck?\nMcDermott isn\u2019t afraid of the usual culture-war controversies that have come to bedevil leaders at large corporations. ServiceNow, for instance, has a well-developed, public facing DEI program, of the type that has lately become unfashionable.\nRobby Starbuck\u2014the conservative activist who organizes boycotts of companies that he believes are too \u201cwoke\u201d\u2014recently forced Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson, among others, to back away from their DEI initiatives.\nSo what will McDermott do if Starbuck comes calling?\n\u201cWell the good news about ServiceNow is we haven't played \u2018acronym bingo,\u2019\u201d McDermott says.\n\u201cIf you're not growing and you're managing and all you talk about is corporate acronyms, that could be a problem for that phone call. But when you're growing like we are, we have to source talent from every corner of the earth to keep up with the pace of our growth. So if we didn't believe in diversity, if we didn't have an equitable and an inclusive culture, there's no way we could be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. So I think that call would be pretty simple.\u201d\nQuestion 5: Is working remotely OK?\nMcDermott is not a fan of 100% remote working. He asked the company to return to the office about two years ago. ServiceNow currently has a flexible policy in which some employees come in two days a week unless they are designated remote workers.\n\u201cI believe strongly that people do their best work in person.\u201d\n\u201cWe need everybody in the company to cross-pollinate and innovate and work as teams. So, basically, when I asked the company to do it, I didn't have to mandate it. I just had to say, we need it now, we have to hit the accelerator, people came back.\u201d\nBut when the CEO says \u201cwe need it now,\u201d surely that's a mandate?\n\u201cIf they trust you, it's not a mandate. It's a desire. It is \u2018I need you. I trust you. I want you with me.\u2019 I'm not telling you I have to have you tied to a chair, and I'm not telling you I'm going to fire you if you don't do it. I'm telling you, I need you to do it and I don't ask for things that I don't need. And they responded next day, the parking lots are all full. There\u2019s a difference between leading and managing and I don't think it's healthy to actually have people that feel forced into things,\u201d he says. \u201cOne volunteer is worth 10 pressed people.\u201d\nQuestion 6: Are you a micromanager or do you prefer to delegate?\nThis question is important because McDermott has, in the past, insisted on riding along on sales calls with his staff.\n\u201cI hire people that are the best in the world at what they do and I trust them with my life. I think trust is the ultimate human currency and I think the best leaders hire people that are substantially better than them. In every area of domain expertise. So, if you have a CFO, they have to be better at you than finance. If you have a CHRO, they have to know more about the people equation than you do. If you hire a head of engineering, they have to be an extraordinary exemplar of an engineering manager and they should know a lot more than you do. In other words, when I look around the table of my leadership team, I'm humbled, that's how good they are.\u201d\n\u201cI also believe strongly that we have to go into the details and we have to be with our customers and we have to be shoulder to shoulder with the customer so you understand the pain that they deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cI become obsessed with their problems. And I want 26,000 people to be obsessed with their problems, so we come up with new solutions to make them better.\u201d\nQuestion 7: What is the most difficult thing you have tackled as CEO?\nGrowing the company from 7,000 people to 26,000 must have involved some difficulties. But McDermott won't admit it.\n\u201cI love scale. I came here from a company that had a hundred thousand people. So my whole life has been spent scaling companies, so the things that people might find difficult, we find great joy in, we bring new people into the culture, we get new people to buy into the\u00a0purpose.\u201d\nThat sounds like PR spin. Surely there must have been pain points while growing ServiceNow?\n\u201cI've encountered thousands of challenges, but is that a difficulty? Or is that a challenge? Is that A setback? Or is that an opportunity,\u201d he says.\nAnd then, just in case you needed a reminder of the level of intensity he is working at, he adds:\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what is pain? Your pain might be my pleasure.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Top findings include a group of AI Pacesetters\u2014government organizations relatively more advanced in using AI and other emerging technologies\u2014that are driving efficiency and achieving better outcomes than organizations that have been slower to adopt AI-powered workflows and automation. Key insights illuminate the unique ways Pacesetters use AI to improve citizen and employee experiences, strengthen compliance, and scale business processes.\nAccording to the research, many government organizations have yet to reap the full benefits of digital technology and relatively few are leveraging innovation to advance their diverse missions. The report outlines best practices implemented by Pacesetters that can be replicated in other government organizations to improve outcomes.\n\"In today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, governments need AI-driven solutions to meet the evolving expectations of citizens and employees,\" said Jonathan Alboum, Federal CTO at ServiceNow. \"This report reinforces that leading governments are already reaping the benefits of AI through accelerated service delivery, citizen experience, and employee productivity. Whether you\u2019re a Pacesetter or still in the beginning stages of a digital journey, these findings show that the future is promising for those willing to embrace AI.\"\nKey findings from The State of AI-Powered Transformation in Government include:\nImproving Speed of Mission\nPacesetters significantly improve their speed and agility by integrating automation into their organizations\u2019 processes. This profoundly impacts both government employees and the citizens they serve.\nFaster time to value with more benefits. Most Pacesetters (61%) achieve a 1.5X faster return on digital investments and report greater outcomes from those investments \u2013 including higher asset utilization and return (50%), improved compliance and risk management (49%), and faster public services (41%).\nAutomating workflows with end-to-end platforms. Pacesetters are making greater progress in implementing end-to-end platforms, with 67% expecting to make advanced progress within the next three years. Currently, 59% have invented new cross-functional workflows that leverage human and AI collaboration.\nAccelerating productivity and ability to scale transformation. Pacesetters boost productivity via specific digital solutions, such as mobile apps (64%), performance management systems (43%), and AI-enabled tools (38%). Those investments are paying off for Pacesetters, measured by improved staff retention (49%), employee upskilling and reskilling (44%), and productivity (41%).\nStory Continues\nAI-Powered Citizen Service Delivery\nPacesetters are finding new momentum within their Citizen Experience (CX) efforts through unique uses of AI and other digital solutions. This is not only improving citizen service delivery but also helping build trust.\nReshaping government services with AI. Governments are using AI in various ways to accelerate citizen service delivery. The top uses for AI among Pacesetters include personalization of citizen communication and engagement, continuous service improvement with feedback loops, and citizen queries and recommendations.\nTechnology improves citizen experience and builds trust. Pacesetters are making greater use of apps and automation to reach citizens.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the UBS' Top Tech Based Disruptive Stocks For 2030: Top 29 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Over its four latest quarters, the firm has raked in $1.3 billion in trailing twelve month net income on the back of continued deal diversification. Through this, ServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 1.88%\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the biggest SaaS companies in the world. The firm provides products that enable users to automate their business processes and manage human resource operations, IT operations, and others. The firm has raked in $1.1 billion in trailing twelve-month net income and its shares are up 33.5% year to date. Since it\u2019s a SaaS stock, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u2019s narrative depends on its ability to sustain revenue levels, maintain profitability, grow its customer base, and increase the portion of larger deals within the overall mix. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) appears to be executing well on these fronts. During the second quarter, the firm grew customers with annual recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% and its committed remaining performance obligations by 31% to a whopping $18.6 billion. The latter is a particularly important metric since it measures the money that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is nearly guaranteed to receive in the future. This helps evaluate the firm\u2019s future cash flows.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in\u00a0Adobe\u00a0and\u00a0ServiceNow\u00a0earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 6th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ServiceNow, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NOW a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $13.83.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.3%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.36 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for NOW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses.

A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Darren. Good afternoon, everyone, I really appreciate you joining today. Because a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report, I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow is growth trajectory. First is elite level execution, with our Q3 results we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution.\nWe outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand. The defense logistics agency works with ServiceNow assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project. Bangkok de Brazil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation.\nThe Veterans Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the Veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI powered solutions to improve its colleague experience.\nAfter rolling out now assist globally, EY works with ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks to deliver faster resolutions for enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life saving mission.\nMercedes Benz work to its ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million.\nAlso, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 39.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $959.64 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,034.\nStory Continues\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.
