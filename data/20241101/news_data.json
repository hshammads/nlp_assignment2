          "whole_article": "The quarterly results this week of Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) provided an AI-era playbook for making investors patiently wait for results on massive infrastructure spending.\nAlphabet dazzled Wall Street on Tuesday with earnings that beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong growth in its cloud business. The company posted profit and sales increases of 37% and 15%, respectively, compared to the year prior.\nEven as investors in recent months have expressed some impatience with the tech industry's enormous investments in AI technology, Google showed that a dominant performance of its core business can alleviate those concerns.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAmazon, too, offered a resounding earnings beat. The company posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. The stellar report helped offset lingering concerns about mounting capital expenditures.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call Thursday that \"as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and Jassy said the company plans to spend \"more than that\" in 2025.\nThe e-commerce giant's approach to selling AI spending was also helped by claims that new revenue has already arrived. While Amazon has not disclosed exact figures for AI-related sales, Jassy has said the AI business inside of its cloud unit has generated several billion dollars. And on Thursday he added that the business is growing at a \"triple-digit year-over-year percentage.\u201d\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy expects to spend even more money in 2025 on capital expenditures, driven by the development of AI technology. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut investors have not given all the big-spending tech companies the same leeway when it comes to ballooning capital expenditures.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) were met with a more unforgiving investor response this week, even as both tech giants beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue. Investors sent both stocks lower after their respective reports. Wall Street recoiled after executives of both companies said they expect capex to continue increasing in the quarters to come.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth next year and revised its expectation upward for 2024 capex. The uneasiness among investors harkens back to Facebook's prior spending spree, when Reality Labs lost more than $13 billion and shares in the company tanked 60% in 2022. Zuckerberg has since improved the company's financials and its standing on Wall Street, but he's also prompted a fresh round of jitters.\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's boosted AI spending came with its own troublesome news: The company said it expects slower growth in its cloud business, highlighting the risks of dedicating major resources to AI development without the returns to offset them.\nBoth Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have framed their spending on AI as worthwhile endeavors, helping to massage the worries of investing in a new technology with uncertain returns. Earlier this year Pichai addressed Wall Street's fears head on: \"The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.\u201d In his view, spending too much on AI is a small price to pay for claiming a leadership position in a future AI-dominated landscape.\nJassy offered a similar argument on Thursday, describing generative AI as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\nGoogle and Amazon investors appear to be taking them at their word.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss.\nOn October 31, CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach joined \u2018Money Movers\u2019 to discuss big tech\u2019s AI spending. Kovach observes that, apart from ChatGPT, no other AI product has achieved a breakthrough, despite ongoing efforts from many companies. Currently, most of the money is going to chip makers and cloud businesses, and there is no evidence of meaningful sales or engagement around AI products that people may want to use every day. Kovach's observation implies that tech giants continue to invest heavily in foundational AI advancements and that high-engagement consumer products may still have time to launch. Additionally, many of these big tech companies have reported that they will continue to step up their already high spending on AI infrastructure.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News You Should Not Miss\u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\nFor many like Kovach, OpenAI represents the leading and most mainstream AI breakthrough, with each of its moves highly anticipated. After all, the company is widely credited for bringing artificial intelligence tools into widespread use. In its latest breakthrough, OpenAI has launched \"ChatGPT Search\u201d, the company's new search engine, positioning the high-powered AI startup to compete with search engines like Bing, Perplexity, and Google. This search feature within ChatGPT provides up-to-the-minute sports scores, stock quotes, weather, and more, driven by real-time web searches and partnerships with news and data providers.\n\u201cI find it to be a way faster/easier way to get the information I\u2019m looking for. I think we\u2019ll see this especially for queries that require more complex research. I also look forward to a future where a search query can dynamically render a custom web page in response!\u201d\nIn a notable advancement towards more accessible AI products and services, SpotAI, a leader in AI camera systems, announced the launch of its Video AI Agents. The announcement strives to bring agentic AI capabilities from the digital to the physical world. These agents assist organizations in identifying and resolving incidents, offering measurable ROI in sectors such as manufacturing, education, retail, and automotive services; all without the need for human intervention.\nIn a similar development within the AI landscape, OSARO, a global leader in machine-learning-enabled robotics for high-volume fulfillment centers, has launched OSARO AutoModel. The OSARO AutoModel allows robots to automatically learn and adapt to new items, processes, and workflows with zero downtime; unlike previous robots that need updating for new SKUs.\nStory Continues\nContinuing the trend of leveraging artificial intelligence in our increasingly AI-driven world, Bolster, a leader in multi-channel phishing protection, announced on Thursday its newest feature called Bolster AI Security for Email. The Bolster AI Security for Email automates the analysis and mitigation of cyber threats reported through customer abuse mailboxes. The new feature combines crowdsourced customer reports and AI-driven automation to protect brands from fraud schemes in real-time.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is an American multinational technology conglomerate offering social networking, advertising, and business insight solutions. The company is a leader in AI amongst social media stocks, with strong AI and metaverse ambitions as it tries to build diverse revenue streams.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced its fiscal third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on October 30. The company beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. It reported a revenue of $40.59 billion, while analysts' estimates were $40.29 billion. Moreover, net income was $15.69 billion, an increase of 35%.\u00a0 The company\u2019s strong quarter was driven by advancement in AI across its products and strong momentum with Meta AI, Llama adoption, and AI-powered glasses. Despite the big earnings beat, Meta shares sank in after-hours trading due to the company\u2019s capital expenditure, up 36% to $9.2 billion. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg further warned of a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in artificial-intelligence-related infrastructure expenses next year, sending mixed signals to investors about whether the company\u2019s digital ad sales from its social media business would continue to cover the cost of its massive AI buildout. Dan Ives, Wedbush managing director, on CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell, notes that Meta stock dropping is actually the \u201cwrong reaction\u201d here.\n\u201cThe formula around building out the infrastructure is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term, that we\u2019re growing that. But, I just think that the opportunities here are really big, we\u2019re going to continue investing significantly in this and I\u2019m proud of the teams that are doing great work to stand up a large amount of capacity so that way we can deliver world-class models and world-class products.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Last week saw the newest third-quarter earnings release from Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$41b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Meta Platforms surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$6.03 per share, a notable 14% above expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Meta Platforms after the latest results.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nAfter the latest results, the 63 analysts covering Meta Platforms are now predicting revenues of US$186.0b in 2025. If met, this would reflect a solid 19% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to expand 14% to US$24.96. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$184.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$24.62 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$636. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Meta Platforms analyst has a price target of US$811 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$475. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 15% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 15% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 11% annually. So it's pretty clear that Meta Platforms is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$636, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

Tech earnings have also been moderately upbeat with some giants coming up with great results and some failing to impress investors.\nKey Tech Earnings Results\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) and its rapid adoption have been ruling the latest U.S. market, the latest tech earnings deserve attention. Tesla stock TSLA, although down 1.6% in the past month, surged post earnings release on margin improvement and upbeat guidance. Netflix NFLX is up 6.3% in the past month on upbeat earnings and strong fundamentals (read: Should Netflix Replace Tesla in \"Mag 7\"? ETFs in Focus).\nFacebook parent company Meta META announced its fiscal third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines. The company expects capital expenses to grow considerably in 2025.\nMeta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg cautioned investors that Meta will continue to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. The META stock fell post earnings on heavy spending plans.\nMeanwhile, some analysts believe that Microsoft MSFT stock will prove to be a long-term winner as Azure and AI scale up. Despite the strong performance, Microsoft's shares faced some downward pressure right after the earnings release due to Azure's growth aligning closely with the anticipated 33% increase. The guidance for Azure was slightly below market expectations, projected at 31-32% compared to the forecasted 32-33%.\nOn the other hand, Alphabet GOOGL came up with better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Oct. 29 after market close. Cloud growth has acted as a tailwind. The surge in cloud revenues comes as rivals Microsoft and Amazon AMZN are also expected to expand their cloud businesses and boost investments in AI infrastructure (read: Google Soars on Upbeat Q3 Earnings: ETFs to Consider).\nAt Oct-end, Amazon.com reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, driving its stock up 5.7% in after-hours trading despite issuing lower-than-expected guidance for the upcoming quarter. Amazon stressed on its continued investment in AI capabilities.\nApple AAPL beat earnings expectations. Its flagship iPhone line remains crucial, generating $46.22 billion, reflecting strong early demand for the iPhone 16. However, revenue from Mac and iPad divisions fell short of projections, indicating likely demand fluctuations in non-iPhone segments. Shares dropped 1.8% after hours on Oct. 31.\nStory Continues\nU.S. Economy Grows Faster Than Expected in Q3\nThe U.S. economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace in Q3 as consumer spending grew. Forecasters expected the country's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of goods and services produced in the U.S. \u2014 to come in at 2.6% in the three-month period ended in September, according to a survey of economists by the data firm FactSet. The latest GDP figure is down slightly from the second quarter's growth of 3%.\nDecent-to-Upbeat Jobs Report\nThe September jobs report offered hopes for U.S. markets. U.S. job gains showed the highest increase in six months, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. Meanwhile, employers are expected to have hired 120,000 workers in October, a slower pace than September's\u00a0254,000 new jobs,\u00a0according to FactSet, as quoted on CBSNews. Recent hurricanes and the East Coast port strike probably had a drag on the jobs growth.\nEscalating Geopolitical Tensions\nTensions in the Middle East escalated in early October following an Iranian missile attack on Israel, spurring demand for safe-haven assets as investors grew anxious about the potential expansion of the conflict. At the end of the month, Israeli airstrikes were launched in retaliation. Among the targets that Israel appears to have hurt are Iran\u2019s favorite Russia-made S-300 air defense systems, according to U.S. and Israeli officials.\nETFs in Focus\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of the past one month (as of Oct. 31, 2024).\nAdvisorShares Psychedelics ETF (PSIL) \u2013 Up 61.6%\nDue to the reverse stock split, the ETF PSIL saw a huge gains in price. Additionally, Mind Medicine stock that takes about 14.43% of the fund jumped about 11% in October. Cybin stock, which takes about 10.19% of the fund gained 11.5%. The ETF invests in drug companies designed for mental health.\nValkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) \u2013 Up 18.7%\nBitcoin prices surged to the level of $73,000 in the month. The cryptocurrency soared due to political benefits, mainstream acceptance, rising wealth effect, protection against inflation and the start of the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycle (read: 5 Factors to Bet on Bitcoin ETFs).\nSimplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF (PFIX) \u2013 Up 20.9%\nThe benchmark U.S. treasury yields jumped to 4.29% on Oct. 30, 2024, from a 3.74% yield recorded at the start of the month. The annual inflation rate in the United States slowed for a sixth successive month to 2.4% in September 2024. This has lowered the chances of the next Fed rate cut in the near term, which in turn has boosted bond yields.\nRange Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF (NUKZ) \u2013 Up 14.1%\nThe underlying Range Nuclear Renaissance Index tracks the performance of companies involved in the nuclear fuel and energy industry, particularly in the areas of advanced reactors; utilities; construction and services and fuel.\nTo keep up with the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and address clean energy requirements, tech giants are turning to nuclear energy to power the energy-intensive data centers for training and operating the large-scale AI models used in today\u2019s generative AI applications. This has boosted the demand for nuclear ETFs (read: Uranium ETFs Surge as Big Tech Powers Up With Nuclear Energy).\nabrdn Physical Palladium Shares ETF (PALL) \u2013 Up 11.7%\nThe price of Palladium continued its upward trend in late October. It reached its highest level in more than 10 months. The U.S. government\u2019s latest pledge to the G7 members to consider further ways to reduce Russian revenues in the metals space, including restrictions on Palladium exports, has probably boosted the price. The price increase is likely to have been aggravated by the covering of speculative short positions.\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Plans to invest even more.\nThe capital expenditures of the four largest internet and software companies \u2014 Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. \u2014 are set to total well over $200 billion this year, a record sum for the profligate collective. Executives from each company warned investors this week that their splurge will continue next year, or even ramp up.\nThe spree underscores the extreme costs and resources consumed from the worldwide boom in AI ignited by the arrival of ChatGPT. Tech giants are racing to secure the scarce high-end chips and build the sprawling data centers the technology demands. To do so, the companies have cut deals with energy providers to power these facilities, even reviving a notorious nuclear plant.\nThey\u2019re each trying to convince Wall Street that these huge investments will make their future businesses more profitable than the current ones selling digital ads, goods and software.\nOn an investor call on Thursday, Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, called AI a \u201creally unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,\u201d evidenced by his company\u2019s projection for a record $75 billion in spending for 2024. \u201cI think our customers, the business, and our shareholders will feel good about this long term \u2014 that we\u2019re aggressively pursuing it.\u201d Analysts at MoffettNathanson called Amazon\u2019s spending \u201ctruly staggering.\u201d\nA day earlier, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to ramp up investing in AI language models and other futuristic projects he now frames as core to his company\u2019s future. Meta\u2019s capital spending may climb as high as $40 billion this year. Meanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s capex budget came in higher than Wall Street expectations, and its Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi projected \u201csubstantial\u201d increases in 2025.\nApple Inc. has also vowed to invest in AI, introducing a suite of services, like a more capable Siri, called Apple Intelligence. But its relatively weak financial results this quarter weren\u2019t helped by its new AI products, which mostly hadn\u2019t arrived.\nStory Continues\nFinancial results for the tech giants this week were a mixed bag. Shares of Amazon and Google parent Alphabet soared after the companies beat earnings expectations, largely on the strength of growth in their cloud-computing units. But Meta and Microsoft fell after the former\u2019s spending plans caused jitters, and the latter\u2019s outlook for cloud revenue growth disappointed.\nAlphabet, Microsoft and Meta were all up slightly in premarket trading on Friday, while Amazon rose 6.7% before New York exchanges opened. Apple declined in early trading by about 1.1%.\nFor Microsoft, its lackluster quarterly performance came not because customers weren\u2019t lining up to pay for its cloud and AI offerings but because the company couldn\u2019t build capacity quickly enough. \u201cThis demand all showed up pretty fast,\u201d CEO Satya Nadella told investors in a call on Wednesday. Data centers, he added, \u201cdon\u2019t get built overnight.\u201d\nMicrosoft spent $14.9 billion in the quarter, a 50% rise from last year \u2014 and an amount higher than the company had ever spent on property and equipment in a single year before 2020. CFO Amy Hood told investors Microsoft will work to put its data center supply issue in a \u201cmore balanced position.\u201d\nAnalysts were broadly optimistic that Microsoft\u2019s data center supply difficulties will eventually be straightened out. The issue will \u201cmodestly\u201d restrict Microsoft\u2019s cloud business, but the company\u2019s investments, particularly its large stake in OpenAI, are \u201cplanting the longer-term seeds for success,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note after the company\u2019s results.\nWall Street\u2019s concern with runaway spending isn\u2019t going away. This week Meta reported $4.4 billion in operating losses for Reality Labs, its division that makes augmented reality glasses and other gadgets far from commercial success. The company has also spent heavily to make its Llama models that aim to compete with Google and OpenAI.\nOn the Meta earnings call, Zuckerberg argued that these AI investments are improving the company\u2019s primary business of selling ads on Facebook and Instagram. But investors will remain nervous about any signs of weakness in the ads business \u201cas they continue to wait for a return on Meta\u2019s bigger AI bets,\u201d said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst for Emarketer.\nStill, Meta\u2019s stock is up 60% this year. And some analysts said Zuckerberg\u2019s big spending will pay off down the line. \u201cOf course, history is on his side,\u201d MoffettNathanson wrote in their report, \u201cand investors now have been trained that patience here is a virtue.\u201d\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Henry Ren.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nTrump\u2019s Immigration Policy Would Make Food Inflation Even Worse\nHow to End the Backlog of Asylum Cases?

(NASDAQ:META), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) and Block Inc (NYSE:SQ).\nThe Tesla Trade: Ark Invest\u2019s ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) sold a total of 8,384 shares of the Elon Musk-led company. With Tesla\u2019s closing price at $249.85 on Thursday, the value of this trade amounts to approximately $2.09 million. This move is in line with Ark\u2019s recent trend of reducing its Tesla holdings.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $1,000\nWood\u2019s ARK Investment Management sees Tesla's driverless ride-hailing plans as a game-changer, potentially unlocking $11 trillion in revenue by leveraging lower operating costs of electric vehicles. ARK\u2019s analysis suggests that Tesla\u2019s robotaxi service could offer rides at a fraction of current ride-hailing and personal vehicle costs, making it a competitive alternative.\nThe Meta Platforms Trade: Ark Invest\u2019s Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF), ARKK, and ARKW bought a total of 34,076 shares of Meta Platforms. Given Meta\u2019s closing price of $567.58 on Thursday, the total value of this trade is approximately $19.34 million.

The firm sold 243,549 shares of the Jack Dorsey-led company from its ARKK and ARKW. The value of this trade, based on Block\u2019s closing price of $72.32 on the same day, amounts to approximately $17.6 million.\nStory Continues\nThe move came on the same day that Block CEO Dorsey announced a fresh wave of layoffs at Tidal. In a note to Tidal employees, Dorsey stated the need for the company to function \u201clike a startup again,\u201d necessitating a much smaller team across the organization.\nInterestingly, the trade also comes at a time when Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), a core focus of Block, has been hovering near previously reached all-time highs.\nOther Key Trades:\nArk Invest\u2019s ARKF and ARKK bought a total of shares of Roku Inc.

          "whole_article": "Meta Platforms Inc exhibits robust revenue growth and operational efficiency in its latest quarterly report.\nInvestments in research and development signal a strong commitment to innovation and future growth.\nDespite increasing competition, Meta maintains a dominant position in the social media landscape.\nEmerging threats and regulatory challenges could impact Meta's long-term strategy and market position.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.\nOn October 31, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) released its 10-Q filing, revealing significant insights into the company's financial performance and strategic direction. The third-quarter results show a notable increase in revenue, reaching $40,589 million, up from $34,146 million in the same period the previous year. Net income also saw a healthy rise to $15,688 million, compared to $11,583 million in 2023. These figures underscore Meta's ability to generate and grow profits, despite the dynamic and competitive nature of the tech industry. The company's investment in research and development, totaling $11,177 million for the quarter, reflects a deep-seated commitment to innovation, crucial for maintaining its competitive edge and exploring new market opportunities.\nDecoding Meta Platforms Inc (META): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Brand Value: Meta Platforms Inc's dominant position in the social media industry is one of its most formidable strengths. With nearly 4 billion monthly active users across its Family of Apps, Meta's brand value is unparalleled. This user base provides a vast trove of data, enabling the company to offer highly targeted advertising solutions, a key revenue driver. The recent financials from the 10-Q filing indicate a solid operational performance, with a 19% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 35% increase in net income, showcasing the company's robust financial health and the strength of its core advertising business model.\nInnovation and R&D Investments: Meta's commitment to research and development is evident from its substantial R&D expenditure, which has increased to $11,177 million in the latest quarter, up from $9,241 million the previous year. This investment fuels innovation, allowing Meta to stay ahead in technology advancements and product development. The company's focus on emerging technologies, such as augmented and virtual reality, positions it well to lead in the next wave of digital interaction, potentially revolutionizing how users engage with social media and digital content.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite its strengths, Meta Platforms Inc's heavy reliance on advertising revenue is a significant weakness. This dependence makes the company vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising demand and changes in ad delivery effectiveness. The 10-Q filing indicates that the vast majority of Meta's revenue is derived from advertising, which could be a risk factor if there's a shift in advertiser preferences or an economic downturn affecting marketing budgets.\nStory Continues\nRegulatory and Legal Challenges: Meta faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges that could impact its operations and financial performance. The company's data privacy practices, content moderation policies, and competitive behavior are under the microscope globally. Any adverse regulatory developments or legal rulings could lead to fines, operational restrictions, or mandatory changes to its business practices, which could weaken Meta's market position and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into New Markets: Meta Platforms Inc has the opportunity to expand its user base and revenue streams by entering new markets and demographics. With a significant portion of the world's population still not online, Meta can leverage its existing platforms and develop new products to cater to these untapped markets. The company's financial resources and expertise in scaling social media services position it well to capitalize on these growth opportunities.\nMonetization of Emerging Technologies: The company's investments in the metaverse and other emerging technologies present significant opportunities for new revenue channels. As highlighted in the 10-Q filing, Meta's Reality Labs business, though currently a small part of overall sales, represents a strategic investment in the future of social interaction and commerce. Successfully monetizing these technologies could lead to substantial growth and diversification of revenue sources.\nThreats\nIntensifying Competition: The tech industry is characterized by rapid innovation and shifting user preferences, leading to intense competition. Meta Platforms Inc must contend with a range of competitors, from established tech giants to innovative startups. These competitors may introduce new features or platforms that erode Meta's user base or advertising revenue, as indicated by the company's acknowledgment of competitive threats in its 10-Q filing.\nRegulatory Pressures: Meta is subject to a complex web of global regulations that govern data privacy, content, and competition. The 10-Q filing notes the potential adverse effects of regulatory changes on the company's ability to develop and use AI, as well as the collection and use of data. Increasing regulatory pressures could limit Meta's operational flexibility and lead to increased compliance costs, impacting its bottom line.\nIn conclusion, Meta Platforms Inc's latest 10-Q filing paints a picture of a company with strong financials and a commanding market position, bolstered by its commitment to innovation and development of emerging technologies. However, its reliance on advertising revenue and the ever-present regulatory challenges represent areas that require careful navigation. As Meta continues to invest in new markets and technologies, it must also remain vigilant against competitive and regulatory threats that could shape its future success.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

          "whole_article": "It's no secret the overall media and entertainment industry has struggled in recent years, burdened by labor strikes, profitability challenges, and a transition to streaming that's upended some of the most well-known corporate behemoths.\nOne company, though, has thrived amid the various changes: Netflix (NFLX).\nThe streaming platform beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs. The stock is up more than 50% since the start of the year.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCompared to other players, Netflix's subscriber count and profitability stand out.\nThe streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%.\nAnd in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close.\nDisney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks.\n\"Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,\" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance.\nOther analysts have piled onto that thinking, declaring the infamous streaming wars officially over.\n\"Netflix won the streaming wars,\" MoffettNathanson, one of the leading equity research firms for the tech and media sector, said in a note penned by analyst Robert Fishman last week. \"The media space right now is defined by a dichotomy in which Netflix stands as a lone exception.\"\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan agreed, recently telling Yahoo Finance's Market Domination that the company has \"undoubtedly\" secured its No. 1 position.\nHow we got here\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and, most importantly, subscribers.\nThe goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\nStory Continues\nAt the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. \"Bridgerton\" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.\nOthers soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for \"The Office\" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time.\nNetflix CEO Ted Sarandos (C) poses with cast and crew as they arrive for Netflix's \"Bridgerton Season 3\" premiere at Alice Tully Hall on May 13, 2024, in New York City. (ANDREA RENAULT / AFP) \u00b7 ANDREA RENAULT via Getty Images\nBut investors quickly realized that streaming is a tough business. It's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. Case in point: the profit struggles at Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount, among others.\nNetflix, viewed by even its competitors as \"the gold standard\" in streaming, has consistently had the upper hand due to its first-mover advantage as a pure-play streaming company. Its innovative approach to monetization, which includes controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, has also helped boost its positioning.\nAs the market stands today, Netflix's total enterprise value is now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined. Its viewed as a growth stock on Wall Street with full-year revenue expected to climb over 15% year over year.\nAnd as the chart below shows, Netflix's estimated enterprise multiple, which is a ratio used to determine the value of a company after taking into account debt and cash levels, in addition to stock price and cash profitability, comes second only to tech giant Apple. Not too shabby for a pure-play streaming player.\nCatching up to Netflix\nFishman argued in his note that a handful of key assets will be needed for streaming players to not only catch up to Netflix but to survive the industry's massive transition.\nThis includes a scaled streaming service (both in the US and globally), a free advertising video-on-demand (AVOD) platform, top-tier sports rights, a US broadcast network, and film and television studios.\nNot every company will need each one of these assets. But having any can boost a company's respective position within the industry.\nTake Disney (DIS), for example. The media conglomerate checks off every box except a free AVOD platform. But having a scaled streaming service in the US and abroad, like Netflix has, appears to be the formula to success \u2014 at least in the current moment.\n\"That really is, it seems, the end goal,\" Fishman said. \"Whether a company wants that for its own sake (all the traditional players) or to augment sales of toilet paper or cellphones [like Amazon], that is the goal.\"\nThat means joint ventures and other deals like acquisitions will be likely outcomes heading into the back half of the decade.\nParamount (PARA) has already agreed to merge with Skydance Media in a deal that's set to mark an end to the Redstone family's control of the company. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025.\nRegulatory challenges could be an overhang, however. A judge temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), citing antitrust concerns.\nThe Big Tech giants would face similar dealmaking hurdles given their size, while media companies combining with each other would pose its own risk as nearly all of the top players carry heavy debt loads.\nIn his report, Fishman said Fox and WBD have the most complementary assets for a possible combination, especially since WBD lacks the NFL and most recently lost the NBA. The company is currently tied up in litigation after suing the NBA over the loss of those media rights.\nNetflix has won the streaming wars, but where does that leave everyone else? (Getty Images) \u00b7 SimpleImages via Getty Images\nTo that point, sports has emerged as the final frontier of streaming amid a dying cable TV business. But professional leagues have also been hesitant to fully abandon traditional television.\nThat gives the upper hand to companies with a broadcast network like Fox, Comcast and Disney, in Fishman's view.\n\"While leagues are also increasingly comfortable partnering with streamers, as the NFL Thursday Night Football transition from Fox to Amazon showed, doing so still presents a tradeoff in viewership,\" Fishman pointed out. \"Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners.\"\nAnd as new data shows, companies with exposure to both traditional television and streaming typically capture the most eyeballs.\nDisney's traditional broadcast and streaming properties accounted for a combined 11.3% of overall TV viewing time during the month of September, according to the latest Gauge report from Nielsen.\nGoogle's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Netflix rounded out the top five at 10.6%, 9.3%, 8.2%, and 7.9%, respectively.\nLooking ahead, \"Disney has the right asset mix to establish a true second global streaming service after Netflix,\" Fishman predicted. Disney, which is in the midst of finding its next CEO with Bob Iger's contract set to expire at the end of 2026, will report quarterly earnings on Nov. 14.\nBut he warned the rest of traditional media companies like Comcast, Paramount, and Warner Bros. \"still need to quickly determine which path to take in order to better position themselves within the great streaming game\" \u2014 whether that means a merger, asset sale, acquisition, partnership, or something else altogether.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Their $273 price target rests on Apple's ability to sustain high gross margins and lock in strong demand for its upgraded iPhone line. Morgan Stanley's team noted that Apple Intelligence could become a key driver, setting Apple up for a decisive December quarter if consumers respond well to the AI's privacy-first appeal.\nLooking forward, Apple's conservative Q1 guidance could leave room for an upside surprise, particularly if product adoption continues at this pace. BofA Securities shares this optimism, projecting gross margins of 46-47% on favorable component costs and high iPhone demand.

And so, we look for this innate curiosity in people.\u201d\nStory Continues\nExpertise\nFinally, Cook noted that Apple wanted people with relevant expertise to join its workforce.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re doing something in industrial design, we need somebody that knows industrial design and has a skill set in it either from their college days or through their work days,\u201d he said.\nCook suggested that people with these four traits had gone on to be successful at Apple, and that the company would therefore continue to hire those who could bring these attributes to the table.\n\u201cThose are the things that we look for in people, and it\u2019s been a very good formula for us,\u201d he said.\nHowever, he noted that doing well at work was a two-way street, and that working in a job that left you unfulfilled was not a recipe for success.\n\u201cPeople have to work for a reason bigger than themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you want to have a vision for a company that is about serving the customer and somehow improving their lives. You want to do it in an ethical way.\u201d\nWithout those ingredients, he argued, no amount of money would make a job worth doing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no gravitational pull from that\u2014the gravitational pull is always, What are you doing for other people?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with a purpose like that, it\u2019s amazing what people will do from a work point of view.\u201d\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on October 3, 2022.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN) stock closed 6% higher on Friday after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected.\nThe company said on Thursday that it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecast $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said operating income is expected to be between $16 billion and $20 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall Street had projected $17.49 billion.\nIn the third quarter, Amazon posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon's closely tracked Amazon Web Services unit tallied revenue of $27.45 billion in the quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street's projections.\n\"You've got the ingredients you needed for the stock to go up,\" Arun Sundaram, CFRA senior equity research analyst, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nSundaram pointed to Amazon's 11% operating margin, which came in above Wall Street's expectations of 9.34%, as another key driver of the stock's move higher after hours. Arun noted that Amazon is able to pull on other levers in its business, like its e-commerce unit or advertising, to help grow margins while it spends on AI.\nAmazon's earnings follow a volatile few trading sessions for Big Tech companies amid other earnings reports as artificial intelligence spending and how each company is managing it has been in particular focus. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines and posted impressive gains in its cloud and advertising segments, business lines that compete with Amazon.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft and Meta (META) had a tougher going. The stocks of both tech giants fell after their earnings Thursday, as investors were spooked by an increase in AI spending, despite both companies beating expectations after the bell on Wednesday.\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth in 2025. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend \"more than that\" in 2025. In 2023, Amazon's capital expenditures were $48.4 billion. Jassy said the increased spending is driven by generative AI, which he described as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\n\"The faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware,\" Jassy said on the earnings call when explaining why spending continues to grow. \"And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all that up front, in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources.\"\nStory Continues\nJassy added, \"I think, as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon's lucrative cloud business is expected to generate close to $28 billion in the third quarter as the company attracts more clients with new AI services.

          "whole_article": "What Happened?\nShares of cloud computing and online retail behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jumped 7.6% in the morning session after the company reported impressive third-quarter earnings. Amazon blew past analysts' EPS and operating income expectations during the quarter, giving credence to the argument that the company can be much more profitable and high margin going forward. Operating profit guidance for next quarter also came in ahead.\nTaking a closer look at the operating segments, AWS (Amazon Web Services), grew 19% year on year, in line with analysts' estimates, while operating margin beat handily. Notably, AWS reached a revenue run rate of $110 billion amid growing demand for cloud and AI services.\nAdvertising revenue, which is a promising growth driver, also exceeded Wall Street's expectations. AMZN noted that the advertising business recorded strong margin expansion, helping to make sense of the improvements in profitability recorded in the quarter.\nIt wasn't a perfect quarter, as revenue guidance for the next quarter was underwhelming. Given the excitement around margins, though, the market is overlooking the revenue guidance shortfall. Overall, we think this was a very good quarter showing that there might need to be more bullishness around Amazon's long-term margin structure.\nIs now the time to buy Amazon? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nAmazon\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 27 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 25 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski downgraded the stock's rating from Overweight (Buy) to Equal Weight (Hold) and lowered the price target from $225 to $183. The analyst was concerned that the projected gains from AWS (Amazon Web Services - cloud computing business) would likely not be enough to power the profitability narrative. Gawrelski added, \"While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q [operating income], we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well.\"\nAmazon is up 32.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $198.43 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $200 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Amazon\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,215.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

          "whole_article": "The quarterly results this week of Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) provided an AI-era playbook for making investors patiently wait for results on massive infrastructure spending.\nAlphabet dazzled Wall Street on Tuesday with earnings that beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong growth in its cloud business. The company posted profit and sales increases of 37% and 15%, respectively, compared to the year prior.\nEven as investors in recent months have expressed some impatience with the tech industry's enormous investments in AI technology, Google showed that a dominant performance of its core business can alleviate those concerns.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAmazon, too, offered a resounding earnings beat. The company posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. The stellar report helped offset lingering concerns about mounting capital expenditures.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call Thursday that \"as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and Jassy said the company plans to spend \"more than that\" in 2025.\nThe e-commerce giant's approach to selling AI spending was also helped by claims that new revenue has already arrived. While Amazon has not disclosed exact figures for AI-related sales, Jassy has said the AI business inside of its cloud unit has generated several billion dollars. And on Thursday he added that the business is growing at a \"triple-digit year-over-year percentage.\u201d\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy expects to spend even more money in 2025 on capital expenditures, driven by the development of AI technology. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut investors have not given all the big-spending tech companies the same leeway when it comes to ballooning capital expenditures.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) were met with a more unforgiving investor response this week, even as both tech giants beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue. Investors sent both stocks lower after their respective reports. Wall Street recoiled after executives of both companies said they expect capex to continue increasing in the quarters to come.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth next year and revised its expectation upward for 2024 capex. The uneasiness among investors harkens back to Facebook's prior spending spree, when Reality Labs lost more than $13 billion and shares in the company tanked 60% in 2022. Zuckerberg has since improved the company's financials and its standing on Wall Street, but he's also prompted a fresh round of jitters.\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's boosted AI spending came with its own troublesome news: The company said it expects slower growth in its cloud business, highlighting the risks of dedicating major resources to AI development without the returns to offset them.\nBoth Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have framed their spending on AI as worthwhile endeavors, helping to massage the worries of investing in a new technology with uncertain returns. Earlier this year Pichai addressed Wall Street's fears head on: \"The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.\u201d In his view, spending too much on AI is a small price to pay for claiming a leadership position in a future AI-dominated landscape.\nJassy offered a similar argument on Thursday, describing generative AI as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\nGoogle and Amazon investors appear to be taking them at their word.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

          "whole_article": "It's no secret the overall media and entertainment industry has struggled in recent years, burdened by labor strikes, profitability challenges, and a transition to streaming that's upended some of the most well-known corporate behemoths.\nOne company, though, has thrived amid the various changes: Netflix (NFLX).\nThe streaming platform beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs. The stock is up more than 50% since the start of the year.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCompared to other players, Netflix's subscriber count and profitability stand out.\nThe streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%.\nAnd in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close.\nDisney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks.\n\"Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,\" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance.\nOther analysts have piled onto that thinking, declaring the infamous streaming wars officially over.\n\"Netflix won the streaming wars,\" MoffettNathanson, one of the leading equity research firms for the tech and media sector, said in a note penned by analyst Robert Fishman last week. \"The media space right now is defined by a dichotomy in which Netflix stands as a lone exception.\"\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan agreed, recently telling Yahoo Finance's Market Domination that the company has \"undoubtedly\" secured its No. 1 position.\nHow we got here\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and, most importantly, subscribers.\nThe goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\nStory Continues\nAt the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. \"Bridgerton\" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.\nOthers soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for \"The Office\" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time.\nNetflix CEO Ted Sarandos (C) poses with cast and crew as they arrive for Netflix's \"Bridgerton Season 3\" premiere at Alice Tully Hall on May 13, 2024, in New York City. (ANDREA RENAULT / AFP) \u00b7 ANDREA RENAULT via Getty Images\nBut investors quickly realized that streaming is a tough business. It's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. Case in point: the profit struggles at Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount, among others.\nNetflix, viewed by even its competitors as \"the gold standard\" in streaming, has consistently had the upper hand due to its first-mover advantage as a pure-play streaming company. Its innovative approach to monetization, which includes controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, has also helped boost its positioning.\nAs the market stands today, Netflix's total enterprise value is now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined. Its viewed as a growth stock on Wall Street with full-year revenue expected to climb over 15% year over year.\nAnd as the chart below shows, Netflix's estimated enterprise multiple, which is a ratio used to determine the value of a company after taking into account debt and cash levels, in addition to stock price and cash profitability, comes second only to tech giant Apple. Not too shabby for a pure-play streaming player.\nCatching up to Netflix\nFishman argued in his note that a handful of key assets will be needed for streaming players to not only catch up to Netflix but to survive the industry's massive transition.\nThis includes a scaled streaming service (both in the US and globally), a free advertising video-on-demand (AVOD) platform, top-tier sports rights, a US broadcast network, and film and television studios.\nNot every company will need each one of these assets. But having any can boost a company's respective position within the industry.\nTake Disney (DIS), for example. The media conglomerate checks off every box except a free AVOD platform. But having a scaled streaming service in the US and abroad, like Netflix has, appears to be the formula to success \u2014 at least in the current moment.\n\"That really is, it seems, the end goal,\" Fishman said. \"Whether a company wants that for its own sake (all the traditional players) or to augment sales of toilet paper or cellphones [like Amazon], that is the goal.\"\nThat means joint ventures and other deals like acquisitions will be likely outcomes heading into the back half of the decade.\nParamount (PARA) has already agreed to merge with Skydance Media in a deal that's set to mark an end to the Redstone family's control of the company. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025.\nRegulatory challenges could be an overhang, however. A judge temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), citing antitrust concerns.\nThe Big Tech giants would face similar dealmaking hurdles given their size, while media companies combining with each other would pose its own risk as nearly all of the top players carry heavy debt loads.\nIn his report, Fishman said Fox and WBD have the most complementary assets for a possible combination, especially since WBD lacks the NFL and most recently lost the NBA. The company is currently tied up in litigation after suing the NBA over the loss of those media rights.\nNetflix has won the streaming wars, but where does that leave everyone else? (Getty Images) \u00b7 SimpleImages via Getty Images\nTo that point, sports has emerged as the final frontier of streaming amid a dying cable TV business. But professional leagues have also been hesitant to fully abandon traditional television.\nThat gives the upper hand to companies with a broadcast network like Fox, Comcast and Disney, in Fishman's view.\n\"While leagues are also increasingly comfortable partnering with streamers, as the NFL Thursday Night Football transition from Fox to Amazon showed, doing so still presents a tradeoff in viewership,\" Fishman pointed out. \"Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners.\"\nAnd as new data shows, companies with exposure to both traditional television and streaming typically capture the most eyeballs.\nDisney's traditional broadcast and streaming properties accounted for a combined 11.3% of overall TV viewing time during the month of September, according to the latest Gauge report from Nielsen.\nGoogle's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Netflix rounded out the top five at 10.6%, 9.3%, 8.2%, and 7.9%, respectively.\nLooking ahead, \"Disney has the right asset mix to establish a true second global streaming service after Netflix,\" Fishman predicted. Disney, which is in the midst of finding its next CEO with Bob Iger's contract set to expire at the end of 2026, will report quarterly earnings on Nov. 14.\nBut he warned the rest of traditional media companies like Comcast, Paramount, and Warner Bros. \"still need to quickly determine which path to take in order to better position themselves within the great streaming game\" \u2014 whether that means a merger, asset sale, acquisition, partnership, or something else altogether.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Each company has invested heavily in AI, data storage, and innovative technologies to attract business clients and capture greater market share. Today, Amazon leads the group in cloud market share with 31% of the market, then Microsoft with 20% followed by Alphabet with 12%.\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, in the third quarter of 2024, spending on global cloud infrastructure services surged by $15.7 billion, or 23%, over the same period in 2023, reaching over $84 billion for the quarter ending September 30. Over the last year, revenue from cloud infrastructure services hit $313 billion, underscoring the intense competition in this sector. Despite its massive scale, the cloud market continues to expand rapidly, with year-over-year (YoY) growth accelerating for the fourth straight quarter.\nAll three of these stocks reported earnings this week, with the results of their cloud services segments under the microscope. Amazon and Alphabet had positive reactions to their earnings results, while Microsoft saw some selling following its meeting. All companies had very positive results though, beating sales and earnings estimates. Also notable, Amazon stock has outperformed the market year-to-date (YTD), while Alphabet is about in line with market performance and Microsoft below.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMZN, GOOGL and MSFT Earnings Revisions\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have each made significant strides in cloud computing, but their earnings revision trends and growth forecasts tell slightly different stories. Both Amazon and Microsoft currently hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a relatively flat earnings revision trend. On the other hand, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting a more favorable outlook driven by recent upward revisions to its earnings estimates.\nLooking at long-term earnings growth projections, Amazon stands out with an anticipated annual growth rate of 27.2% over the next three to five years led by AWS. Alphabet\u2019s expected growth rate of 17.6% per year reflects its continued growth in cloud services, YouTube and now self-driving with Waymo, while Microsoft, expected to grow at 14.7% annually, showcases steady gains in both its cloud and software offerings, including Azure and Office 365.\nTheir valuation also offers valuable insight into what investors can expect going forward. Today, Alphabet is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.4x which is below its 10-year median of 25.8x, Amazon at 38.4x is also below its 10-year median of 92.4x and Microsoft at 31.2x is above its 10-year median of 26.5x.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMZN, GOOGL or MSFT: Which Shares Should Investors Buy?\nFor investors seeking the best mix of growth potential and value, GOOGL and AMZN stand out as the most attractive choices among the cloud giants. Both companies not only boast strong earnings growth projections\u2014with Amazon leading the group\u2014but also offer relatively appealing valuations compared to Microsoft discounting for growth forecasts and historical valuations.\nAlphabet\u2019s recent performance in the cloud segment and ongoing investments in AI and self-driving cars show huge promise, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio remains appealing given its growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s growth prospects are bolstered by its dominant position in e-commerce and the ever-expanding AWS, which remains a leader in the cloud infrastructure market. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s valuation is more favorable relative to its growth rate and historical average, making it an attractive option for those focused on long-term potential.\nIn contrast, Microsoft\u2019s substantial capital expenditures on AI and other tech advancements\u2014though expected to drive future growth\u2014have been flagged as a point of concern for now. While Microsoft remains a cloud and AI powerhouse, these elevated costs could temper near-term returns, making it comparatively less compelling at current valuations.\nOverall, Alphabet and Amazon\u2019s mix of robust growth forecasts and favorable valuations make them top picks in the cloud landscape for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this internet video service have returned +7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has gained 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nNetflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +99.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.2%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has changed +3.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Roku (ROKU) stock fell more than 17% on Thursday after the company's fourth quarter guidance disappointed, despite the media player reporting its first quarter of $1 billion in revenue.\nFor the current quarter, the company estimated gross profit to hit $465 million, with adjusted EBITDA expected at $30 million. Both metrics fell below Wall Street expectations of $477 million in gross profit and $36.2 million in adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022 USD\n(ROKU)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe company also said it will stop reporting streaming households as a key performance metric, echoing a similar move from streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), which will no longer report subscriber figures at the start of next year.\nInstead, Roku said it will focus on streaming hours, platform revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n\"Since our IPO in 2017, the streaming industry has evolved meaningfully, with Americans now spending significantly more TV time streaming than watching cable,\" Roku said in its earnings release. \"Our business has also grown and evolved, and we are now primarily focused on growing platform revenue and profitability.\"\nPrior to Wednesday's release, shares had rallied more than 30% over the past three months on expectations of a strong ad market and upside to platform revenue growth.\nIt's a critical shift for the company, which underwent a number of cost-cutting measures last year in an effort to bring down operating expenses and improve profits. Roku has recently committed to various monetization initiatives, which have included a deeper integration with programmatic advertising giant the Trade Desk (TTD).\nRoku said those efforts, along with tailwinds from political ad spend, will \"continue in Q4.\"\nA Roku logo is seen on a screen with a silhouette of a hand holding a tv remote. (Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) \u00b7 SOPA Images via Getty Images\nIn the third quarter, Roku reported net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 16% year over year, with a net loss of $65 million, or $0.06 a share. That quarterly net loss was significantly narrower than the $0.33 loss Wall Street expected, as well as the prior-year period's $2.33 quarterly loss.\nPlatform revenue, which includes ad sales, revenue from distribution deals, and the over-the-top streaming service, the Roku Channel, came in at $908 million, up 15% on the year.\nThe boom was driven by strength in advertising sales, content distribution, and expansion into international markets.\n\"In Q3, the year-over-year growth of advertising activities across the Roku platform \u2014 excluding media and entertainment \u2014 outperformed both the overall ad market and the over-the-top (OTT) ad market in the US,\" Roku said, highlighting strength in political, retail, and consumer packaged goods ad verticals.\nStory Continues\nThe company reported 85.5 million streaming households, a sequential increase of 2 million and up 13% year over year. Streaming hours also increased 5.3 billion year over year to reach 32 billion in the quarter.\nOverall, the company has been facing more competition in the connected TV and streaming ads business.\nAmazon (AMZN) rolled out ads on its Prime Video streaming service earlier this year in the US. Wall Street has noted the massive disruption the tech giant has already caused in the space as companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) are also in the running for ad buyers.\nOn Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne reiterated his Underweight rating on shares, categorizing recent optimism as \"premature\" and rising competition \"as an under-appreciated risk.\"\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

AOUT, Crocs, Inc. CROX, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Mattel, Inc. MAT.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n5 Discretionary Stocks to Buy as Consumer Confidence Hits 9-Month High\nU.S. consumers are much more confident now than they were last month. A jumbo rate cut announced last month by the Federal Reserve, coupled with optimism surrounding more interest rate cuts in the coming months, have made consumers confident about the economy's health.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in discretionary stocks such as American Outdoor Brands, Inc., Crocs, Inc., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Netflix, Inc. and Mattel, Inc.. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nConsumer Confidence Soars\nThe Conference Board said on Tuesday that the consumer confidence index surged to 108.7 in October, from 99.2 in the previous month, to hit its highest level in nine months.\nThe Present Situation Index, a measure of consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, jumped 14.2 points to reach 138. The Expectations Index, a measure of consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market situation, rose 6.3 points to 89.1. This was comfortably above the threshold of 80. Any reading below 80 indicates impending recession.\nThe jump in consumer confidence comes after ebbing drastically in September on fears of a slowing economy. Interestingly, consumer confidence remained high in October despite data suggesting a cooling job market.\nThe Labor Department said on Tuesday that job openings fell to a three-and-a-half-year low in September. Despite the decline, the Conference Board's survey showed that consumers' perceptions of the jobs market improved in October, which boosted their confidence.\nMore Rate Cut Hopes Boost Consumer Confidence\nFears gripped markets earlier this month after fresh data showed a slight uptick in monthly inflation in September. This raised concerns over the economy's health, turning markets volatile.\nHowever, consumers are hoping that inflation will still be on track to reach the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first rate cut since March 2020.\nStory Continues\nThe Federal Reserve has also hinted that more rate cuts are on the horizon if inflation continues to ease substantially. The CME FedWatch tool presently shows a 98.9% possibility of a 25-basis point cut in November and a 76.6% probability of a 20-basis point cut in December.

          "whole_article": "Back in 2002, Martha Stewart made headlines for aggressively chopping a cabbage in an effort to avoid speaking of insider-trading allegations. \u201cI want to focus on my salad,\u201d she said through tight lips. Fast-forward more than a decade later and Stewart is still trying to change the focus to more flattering aspects of her life. Or in other words, focus on her salad.\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Stewart apparently spent around 30 minutes complaining about Martha, the Netflix documentary made about her. Calling the second part of the movie \u201ca bit lazy,\u201d Stewart took issue with the way director R.J. Cutler portrayed her.\n\u201cThose last scenes with me looking like a lonely old lady walking hunched over in the garden? Boy, I told him to get rid of those. And he refused. I hate those last scenes. Hate them,\u201d she told the Times, adding that she was limping because she had just had an operation on her Achilles tendon, a detail that the director omitted to her chagrin.\nIndeed, Stewart might have the titular role in said Martha, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s finding herself in all that flattering of a biopic. She said that despite her having three cameras on her, the director would choose \u201cto use the ugliest angle\u201d and ignore her protests to use other ones.\nThe soundtrack was not spared criticism, as Stewart called out the usage of \u201csome lousy classical score,\u201d instead of using mostly rap, which she had deemed an \u201cessential part of the film.\u201d She had suggested that her friend Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre score the film.\nExpressing dismay that some of her more exciting stories were cut, her grandchildren weren\u2019t mentioned, and the allure of her magazines wasn\u2019t touched upon, Stewart expressed her annoyance that her prison sentence got so much attention.\nStewart spent five months, from October 2004 to March 2005, in a minimum-security prison for charges related to insider trading. \u201cI had to go through that to be a trophy for these idiots in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office,\u201d she said in the Netflix documentary, claiming that she was a target because of her title as the first self-made billionaire woman in America.\nShe said of prison that it was \u201cnot a good experience and it doesn't make you stronger\u201d to Katie Couric in 2017. Stewart has since made her comeback, and it appears she doesn\u2019t want to linger on that dip too much.\n\u201cIt was not that important,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cThe trial and the actual incarceration was less than two years out of an 83-year life. I considered it a vacation, to tell you the truth,\u201d she said, adding that the trial was so dull that the judge fell asleep.\nStory Continues\nIndeed, it seems as if over time, Stewart has changed her take on her sentence a bit. In Martha, she calls her daytime show a venture that \u201cmissed the point of Martha Stewart. A live audience, crummy music, that was more like prison than being at Alderson.\"\nThat being said, Stewart praised the first part of the documentary to the Times. She noted that young women have told her that watching the film \u201cgave them a strength they didn\u2019t know they had.\u201d And that was the point of the project.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted the documentary to be. It shouldn\u2019t be me boasting about inner strength and any of that crap. It should be about showing that you can get through life and still be yourself,\u201d she concluded.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 7 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best streaming and TV stocks to invest in.\nConsumer Behaviour Around Streaming Choices\nAlmost all streaming services hiked up their rates and drove subscription prices high in 2023. However, cost is not the biggest factor for consumers while they stream. As of today, the price of streaming services doesn\u2019t affect loyalty to an entertainment provider as it did in the past. Amdocs\u2019 \u201cThe New Streamer 2024\u201d report revealed that consumers are expecting improved experiences with rising costs. According to consumers, original content is the top feature that makes a subscription worthy. Other leading factors include access to older titles, new content every few weeks, and being able to watch anywhere.\nTrends Shaping the Streaming Industry\nForbes reported that streamers have been victims of long-term challenges related to profitability and subscriber growth. To counter these issues while catering to evolving consumer demands, streamers are opting for ad-supported plans. With almost half of the younger generation open to seeing more ads, this is a potential way to boost revenue.\nStreamers are also trying to score exclusive agreements and partnerships with sports leagues as live sports has become a hot commodity in streaming. Simultaneously, the cost of original content comes at reduced profitability. Against this, the potential solution is a consolidation of streaming platforms to allow access to deeper libraries of content for consumers without compromising on their priority of having original content on their plate. Additionally, cloud gaming is being integrated into streaming services considering 70% of Gen Z appears to be interested in it.\nOn October 18, Ben Silverman, Propagate Content Chairman & Co-CEO, appeared on CNBC giving examples of the aforementioned streaming industry trends. Commenting on the robust Q3 earnings for streaming giant Netflix, he said that its success would lead to more consolidation among the traditional media players in the smaller streamer space. The company is increasingly investing in original content, sports content, and gaming, something that will continue to reward the company as it expands its profits as well as businesses. While it has the money from its streaming business to make those investments back into streaming, many players in the streaming space do not have the same capabilities. Comcast also has the ability to sell a lot of WiFi and has many other businesses that can drive investment in the content business. He mentioned the telecommunications and media firm\u2019s acquisition of NBCUniversal becoming an engine for the whole company. In the views of Silverman, more troubled are the companies that are pure-play so they need to either consolidate to get to scale or be acquired by the bigger players in the future.\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, Silverman emphasized how sports acquisitions are the key drivers to advertising and not just the drivers in the ability to scale an audience at once. For instance, The streaming giant will be live-streaming two of the 2024 season\u2019s NFL games on Christmas Day. Previously in July, NBCUniversal and the NBA announced an 11-year agreement for NBC, Peacock, USA Network, Sky Sports, and Telemundo to present NBA and WNBA regular-season and playoff games starting in the 2025-26 season.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in, we sifted through ETFs, the Yahoo Finance stock screener, the Finviz stock screener, and online rankings to create an initial list of stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 7 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNetflix, Inc. (NFLX)'s Financial Growth and Future Advertising Ventures\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNumber of Hedge Fun Holders:\u00a0103\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming entertainment service with 283 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries enjoying TV series, films, and games across various genres and languages. Netflix started its journey in 1997 as a DVD-rental-by-mail firm and began streaming in the US in 2007 and internationally in 2010 while it became global in 2016.\nWith streaming entertainment replacing the linear TV experience potentially for an enduring period, Netflix expects to be one of the leading firms of the streaming entertainment era. The firm has been at a scale where it can economically create original content for Netflix since 2013 thereby reaping the benefits of originals. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a major advantage over its linear competitors as its shows don\u2019t compete for scarce prime-time slots like on linear TV. Furthermore, the reach is vast with Netflix being virtually everywhere except for Russia and China.\nIn the third quarter, revenue grew 15% year-over-year. The firm delivered multiple hits in the quarter including The Perfect Couple, Nobody Wants This, Emily in Paris, and CobraKai. Engagement remains strong with view hours per member amongst owner households increasing year-over-year through the first three quarters of 2024. Netflix is simultaneously improving its advertising business, with ads membership up 35% quarter-on-quarter and ad-tech platform set to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025.\nNetflix is well-positioned to bring engaging stories from many cultures to people globally with its global distribution. The firm is all set to benefit from the universal appeal for high-quality storytelling that transcends borders amidst the growing ubiquity of the internet. The firm remains excited about its Q4 slate including Squid Game S2, the Jake Paul/Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. With a steady drumbeat of hit titles from countries globally, healthy member engagement, and a large strong core business, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is poised for growth.\nOverall, NFLX ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of best streaming and TV stocks to invest in.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Electric vehicle giant Tesla TSLA hit headlines recently with an impressive third-quarter earnings report, sending its stock soaring in one of its biggest single-day gains in a decade. Last week, the Tesla stock jumped about 23% primarily due to margin improvement and an upbeat outlook (read: Tesla Records its Best Day in 11 Years: 5 ETF Winners).\nDespite this surge, Wall Street remains divided over Tesla's place in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d \u2014 a group of market-dominating tech giants, including NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Microsoft MSFT and Tesla (read: Is Tesla's Stock Pop Sustainable? TSLA ETFs in Focus).\nAs the third-quarter earnings season kicks off, the Magnificent Seven is anticipated to record 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth, with NVIDIA, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta among the top contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, per FactSet, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nTesla\u2019s Earnings Rebound Yet Leave Analysts Skeptical\nTesla\u2019s third-quarter profits showed a 17% jump, a meaningful rebound after two quarters of decline. However, analysts remain cautious about Tesla\u2019s long-term position among Big Tech, citing concerns that its fundamentals may be overhyped.\nWe would like to note that Tesla\u2019s delivery numbers fell short of estimates in the past. Tesla has been losing market share to its rivals in both China and the United States, resulting in a notable slowdown in growth. This month itself we have seen Tesla\u2019s unimpressive robotaxi event, which failed to meet expectations, raising concerns among ridesharing investors.\nValuation Concerns Add to Tesla\u2019s Strained Standing\nTesla\u2019s pricey valuation further complicates its status within the Magnificent Seven. Although higher growth tends to demand a higher valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 115.54, Tesla\u2019s valuation far exceeds its tech peers.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalyst sentiment reflects this caution. Tesla currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.96 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 2.89 a month ago based on 38 recommendations.\nOf the 39 recommendations deriving the current ABR, Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 23.08% and 5.13%. It is the lowest approval rate within the Magnificent Seven.\nTesla\u2019s Stock Price Target\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 35 analysts, the average price target for Tesla comes to $206.22. The forecasts range from a low of $24.86 to a high of $310.00. The average price target represents a decline of 23.4% from the last closing price of $269.19 as on Oct. 25.\nStory Continues\nCould Netflix be a More Suitable Candidate?\nAs Tesla\u2019s standing falters, streaming giant Netflix NFLX has emerged as a possible replacement, thanks to its strong earnings, subscriber growth, improving free cash flow and solid guidance. Year to date, Netflix stock has surged by 55%, trailing only NVIDIA and Meta among the Magnificent Seven.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWealth Enhancement Group\u2019s Ayako Yoshioka believes Netflix is an appealing alternative due to its strong earnings and solid guidance. Bank of America loves its free cash flow strength, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Same is the view of Portfolio Wealth Advisors\u2019 Jesus Alvarado-Martinez.\nWith free cash flow reaching $2.19 billion in Q3, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier, Netflix\u2019s cash flow has been rising steadily since the pandemic. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich projects Netflix\u2019s free cash flow to hit $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nBroker Rating on Netflix Stock\nOf the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR of Netflix shares, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.5% and 5% of all recommendations. The Netflix stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has an upbeat VGM Score of B. Netflix shares trade at a forward P/E of 37.88X versus 105.6X forward P/E possessed by the underlying Broadcast Radio and Television.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNetflix-Heavy ETFs in Focus\nInvestors who believe that Netflix shares deserve a spot in the tech elite club may play the stock in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) form, too.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks to buy before they split next.\nS&P 500: Targeting 6,000 Amid Market Optimism\nThere\u2019s been a notable sense of fear among investors despite the market\u2019s current strong performance. The upcoming weeks are expected to be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and an impending election, alongside uncertainty regarding the Fed\u2019s next moves. But the fact remains that the market has shown resilience, with numerous new highs for major indices this year, although investors remain skeptical. Historically, volatility tends to increase after elections as political changes take effect. Currently, volatility is relatively low but is anticipated to rise as January approaches and clarity about potential policy impacts emerges.\nDespite prevailing uncertainties, there remains cautious optimism about the market\u2019s ability to maintain its upward trajectory. In mid-October, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC to the skepticism displayed by investors. We covered his sentiment in our article about the\u00a08 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now:\n\u201cKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents\u2019 experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nAround the same time, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss the market trends as well. On October 14, Mary Ann Bartels highlighted that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, she acknowledged that while this target is achievable, the journey may not be smooth.\nStory Continues\nBartels noted that there could be volatility ahead, as evidenced by increased hedging activity in the market. However, she remains optimistic due to the Fed\u2019s shift towards an easier monetary policy and the ongoing economic growth, which is supported by full employment, albeit with a slight slowdown in job creation. Importantly, she highlighted that corporate profits are on the rise, with earnings currently beating expectations by about 5%. This positive trend across fundamental and technical indicators leads her to believe that the market can continue its rally into November and December.\nAs the S&P 500 recently closed above 5,800 for the first time at 5,815, Bartels discussed how this milestone brings the 6,000 target closer. She echoed sentiments from Tom Lee, who suggested that market behavior could improve significantly if there is clarity regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Bartels agreed that once a winner is declared, it could trigger a relief rally as both domestic and foreign investors gain confidence in the stability of US leadership.\nTurning to the Fed\u2019s actions, Bartels addressed concerns about recent CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected. She described potential short-term volatility as a bucking bull, indicating that while fluctuations might occur, the overall trend remains upward. Her year-ahead thesis suggests both fixed-income and equity markets are poised for positive returns, albeit with some bumps along the way.\nBartels also advocated for buying opportunities in the current market environment. She specifically pointed to technology stocks and the NASDAQ, which has yet to hit a new record high. She believes technology will continue to lead the market, particularly emphasizing semiconductors as key drivers of growth. For investors looking to enter the tech sector, she sees this as an opportune moment.\nHer perspective underscores a belief in the resilience of corporate profits and economic fundamentals amid changing monetary policies and external uncertainties. At the same time, it should be noted that the optimistic outlook for the S&P 500 targeting 6,000 is significant for stock splits as it reflects positive market sentiment, encouraging companies to make their shares more accessible to retail investors. When share prices rise, splits can attract more buyers by lowering the price per share. However, it\u2019s important to note that a stock split does not change anything about a business\u2019s fundamentals. A poor company will stay a poor company post-split and a good company will stay a good company.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of stocks that are likely to split. We then selected the 20 stocks that have experienced the highest gains in their share prices over the past 5 years and have a history of spitting their stock. From that, we picked the top 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Netflix Inc. (NFLX) a Top Stock to Buy Before the Next Split?\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nShare Price as of October 18: $689.66\nSurge in Share Price in 5 Years: 150.51%\nStock Split Confirmed: no\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming service provider that offers TV shows, movies, documentaries, and original content. Founded in 1997 as a DVD rental service, it transitioned to a streaming platform in 2007. It has revolutionized the way people consume entertainment and is considered a pioneer in the streaming industry.\nThe company has introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier powered by AI in late 2022 to enhance user experience and deliver more effective ads. As a pioneer in online streaming, it\u2019s a top-performing stock. Its massive and growing subscriber base drives significant revenue growth. In 2023, it achieved record UK revenues, primarily due to increased subscriber numbers following its crackdown on password sharing.\nRevenue was up by 15.02% year-over-year in Q3 2024. Despite challenges in membership growth and ad monetization, it added over 5 million new subscribers and improved its operating margin to 29.6%. International markets drove subscriber growth, and the ad-supported tier saw a 35% quarter-on-quarter increase in memberships. The company\u2019s strategic shift towards advertising has solidified its position as a strong investment.\nManagement announced that the company\u2019s first-party ad server is launching in Canada this quarter and will expand to other markets in 2025. Partnerships with Trade Desk and Google Live are progressing well. There are plans for more ad formats, features, and measurement tools.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) projects a 14.7% increase in revenue year-over-year for Q4, with a target operating margin of 21.6%. Looking ahead to 2025, it anticipates annual revenue between $43 billion and $44 billion, driven by continued subscriber growth and higher average revenue per subscriber. The international expansion and ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences position it for continued growth.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFinally, we trimmed\u00a0Netflix, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:NFLX) mostly due to valuation but also as a source of funds to add to the new position in Shopify. As a reminder, we added to our position in August 2022 amid broad concerns about the company\u2019s ability to grow and monetize shared passwords. We expected Netflix to show progress in monetizing shared passwords, leading to robust free cash flow generation. This is now playing out and is appreciated by the market. Hence, given the balance of growth and valuation, we felt it was appropriate to reduce our exposure to a more normal weight.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 2nd on our list of stocks to buy before they split next. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NFLX, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

The firm's revenue estimates are 6% and 8% ahead of the consensus for those years, respectively.\nThe anticipated integration with Netflix and Roku is expected to contribute approximately 400 basis points to The Trade Desk's gross spend growth in 2025, positioning the company's revenues ahead of consensus.\nThe firm also notes that The Trade Desk is likely to continue gaining market share from Google's DV360 in the medium term due to Alphabet's legal challenges.\n\u201cIn our view, the biggest benefit from ad-tech legal challenges at Alphabet/Google is likely to be underinvestment&lack of focus, rather than pot'l business model or industry structure changes,\u201d analysts continued.\nSeparately, Citi analysts said they expect \u201canother strong beat and raise quarter\u201d from TTD, noting that key growth drivers including CTV, Retail Media, and market share gains remain intact. Moreover, there is \u201cadditional upside potential from political spend.\"\nRelated Articles\nWells Fargo starts TTD stock at Buy; Citi expects 'strong beat and raise' Q3 print\nTactical Resources files statement with SEC over planned listing via SPAC\nLucid to open orders for Gravity electric SUV next week\nView Comments"

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Netflix\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Netflix\nWhat's The Opportunity In Netflix?\nAccording to our valuation model, Netflix seems to be fairly priced at around 4.1% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Netflix today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $781.04, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Netflix\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nWhat does the future of Netflix look like?\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Netflix. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NFLX\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NFLX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN) stock closed 6% higher on Friday after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected.\nThe company said on Thursday that it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecast $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said operating income is expected to be between $16 billion and $20 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall Street had projected $17.49 billion.\nIn the third quarter, Amazon posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon's closely tracked Amazon Web Services unit tallied revenue of $27.45 billion in the quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street's projections.\n\"You've got the ingredients you needed for the stock to go up,\" Arun Sundaram, CFRA senior equity research analyst, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nSundaram pointed to Amazon's 11% operating margin, which came in above Wall Street's expectations of 9.34%, as another key driver of the stock's move higher after hours. Arun noted that Amazon is able to pull on other levers in its business, like its e-commerce unit or advertising, to help grow margins while it spends on AI.\nAmazon's earnings follow a volatile few trading sessions for Big Tech companies amid other earnings reports as artificial intelligence spending and how each company is managing it has been in particular focus. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines and posted impressive gains in its cloud and advertising segments, business lines that compete with Amazon.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft and Meta (META) had a tougher going. The stocks of both tech giants fell after their earnings Thursday, as investors were spooked by an increase in AI spending, despite both companies beating expectations after the bell on Wednesday.\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth in 2025. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend \"more than that\" in 2025. In 2023, Amazon's capital expenditures were $48.4 billion. Jassy said the increased spending is driven by generative AI, which he described as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\n\"The faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware,\" Jassy said on the earnings call when explaining why spending continues to grow. \"And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all that up front, in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources.\"\nStory Continues\nJassy added, \"I think, as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon's lucrative cloud business is expected to generate close to $28 billion in the third quarter as the company attracts more clients with new AI services.

          "whole_article": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Nvidia (NVDA), which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8.58%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Nvidia came out with earnings of $0.68 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.64 per share, representing a surprise of 6.25%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.55 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.61 per share, delivering a surprise of 10.91%.\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.54%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 20, 2024.\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nStory Continues\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The fund is fully exposed to the downside risk of Tesla's price declines, without the benefit of diversification. Shareholders of the fund are not entitled to receive dividends paid by Tesla.\nYieldMax Magnificent 7 Fund of Option Income ETFs (NYSE:YMAG)\nThis fund is a \"fund of funds,\" meaning it invests in seven YieldMax ETFs instead of individual stocks. The ETFs aim to provide exposure to the Magnificent 7, a group of seven well-known companies including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla.\nThe fund rebalances its portfolio monthly to ensure each YieldMax ETF has an equal weight. While the fund offers indirect exposure to these companies, its potential gains are capped. However, the fund is fully exposed to losses in the underlying stocks' share prices.\nA 9% Return In Just 3 Months\nEquityMultiple's \u2018Alpine Note \u2014 Basecamp Series' is turning heads and opening wallets.

          "whole_article": "During the whirlwind AI boom over the past nearly two years, when market watchers think of AI servers, they think of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The two have been tied at the hip. NVIDIA makes the AI chips, and Super Micro makes the AI servers. Since ChatGPT took the world by storm on November 30, 2022, and the AI race started, NVIDIA\u2019s stock has been up an astonishing 760%, while Super Micro\u2019s stock has been up more than 1200% at its peak. Now, one company is embroiled in an accounting scandal, and the other is trying to distance themselves from the situation.\nOn August 27, 2024, short-selling-focused research firm Hindenburg Research issued a scathing report about Super Micro, alleging corporate maleficence, channel stuffing, related party transactions, selling products to bad actors like Russia, and shoddy workmanship. According to Hindenburg, Super Micro re-hired some of the same top executives charged when the company was hit by SEC accounting violations in 2020, which was later settled. Further, related party questions have been raised about suppliers Ablecom and Compuware. CEO Charles Liang\u2019s brothers control the two suppliers, and Liang and his wife partly own Ablecom. Exports of Super Micro\u2019s high-tech components to Russia are up three-fold since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Hindenburg also found. Meanwhile, competitors like Dell (NYSE:DELL) and others have been winning orders due to quality concerns at Super Micro.\nThe initial shock of the late August Hindenburg report sent Super Micro\u2019s stock immediately down 19%, but matters have only worsened.\nFirst, just one day after the Hindenburg report, the company delayed its 10-K filing for fiscal year 2024, which later triggered a non-compliance letter from the Nasdaq stock exchange warning of a possible delisting. This week, however, the situation took an ugly turn after Super Micro\u2019s auditor, Ernst&Young, resigned, adding fuel to the corporate maleficence fire. In late July 2024, the accounting firm raised \u201cconcerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting\u2026\u201d Additional information received from the accounting firm \u201craised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee.\u201d In the Resignation Letter, the accounting firm stated, in part: \u201cwe are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee\u2019s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.\u201d\nStory Continues\nShares of Super Micro fell another 43% this week following the auditor's resignation. The stock is now down 50% from the Hindenburg short report and 77% from its March 2024 peak.\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA, has largely been unfazed by the Super Micro situation until cracks started emerging this week after the auditor\u2019s resignation. NVIDIA's stock is down nearly 4% since the Super Micro auditor's resignation, including Thursday\u2019s 4.7% sell-off.\nWall Street analysts are now asking if NVIDIA can separate themselves from the Super Micro situation.\nMizuho desk analyst Jordan Klein thinks NVIDIA is at risk of missing its own guidance if the Super Micro situation worsens and they cannot fund the business. He highlights that Super Micro operates with negative working capital and requires a lot of cash and funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid cooling products to build multi-million dollar NVL72 Blackwell rack systems. \u201cHow do you raise money when you have no auditor or are unable to file financial statements?\u201d Klein asks about Super Micro.\nThe analyst thinks NVIDIA will likely start moving most of their GPU supply away from Super Micro until they get more clarity on the situation. The analyst highlighted Super Micro's competitor, Dell, as a likely beneficiary if NVIDIA moves its supply away from Super Micro.\nWhile moving GPU supply away from Super Micro seems like a plausible mid-term solution for NVIDIA, it is unclear if a near-term disruption or possible delayed payments from Super Micro could impact NVIDIA's short-term financial results.\nDespite Super Micro's woes, overall AI demand and the race to Artificial General Intelligence don\u2019t appear to be slowing down, and NVIDIA is still seen as getting the lion's share. BofA Securities, for example, continues to expect AI accelerator demand to grow to $280 billion by 2027 and more than $400 billion over time, with Nvidia garnering 75% of the market share despite increased competition.\nNVIDIA, for its part, is not commenting on the Super Micro matter.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll decline comment,\u201d an NVIDIA spokesperson said when reached by Investing.com for comment about Super Micro.\nDespite not publicly speaking about the Super Micro situation, management's actions show that NVIDIA is quietly distancing itself from Super Micro. In May 2024, as noted by Hindenburg, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang publicly endorsed Super Micro competitor Dell. \u201cNobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell,\u201d Huang said.\nIt remains to be seen whether the Super Micro debacle impacts NVIDIA, but the auditor situation has raised the stakes, and customers are likely asking questions. Now investors are, too.\nRelated Articles\nCan NVIDIA's stock stay out of the SMCI fire?\nAmazon and Chevron lead morning market cap stock movers on Friday\nCboe beats third-quarter profit estimates on strong hedging activity\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, NVIDIA's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\nInsiders have been selling lately\nA look at the shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 66% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nInstitutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$3.3t last week. Still, the 195% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA.\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NVIDIA. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.5% and 4.0% of the stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding.\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nStory Continues\nInsider Ownership Of NVIDIA\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$128b. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 30% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nNext Steps:\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for NVIDIA you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

          "whole_article": "Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +8.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share, indicating a change of +85% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +116.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.77 indicates a change of +33.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $32.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +80.7%. The $124.66 billion and $174.35 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +104.6% and +39.9%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +122.4%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.27 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.72%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Based on training 12-month EV-to-EBITDA, PLTR is currently trading at 387.07X, way above the industry\u2019s 50.29X. If we look at the forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio, the company\u2019s shares are currently trading at 103.67X forward earnings, well above the industry\u2019s 39.9X.\nInvestment Considerations\nPalantir\u2019s AI strategy is comprehensive. It combines its proprietary Foundry and Gotham platforms with a solid plan to promote AI adoption across the government and commercial sectors. The company\u2019s expertise in AI-driven information warfare and cybersecurity supports its sustained growth amid evolving global security demands. In the government sector, Palantir is aligning its AI strategy with U.S. defense priorities. In the commercial space, Palantir's AI Platform (AIP) boot camps \u2014 providing hands-on experience to over 1,000 companies \u2014 have proven instrumental in customer acquisition.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Palantir\u2019s government revenues grew 23% year over year, driven by strong demand for its AI-powered products. U.S. commercial revenues also surged 55%, fueled by the success of AI platforms. Additionally, the company reported an 88% year-over-year increase in operating income and a 1,200 basis points increase in adjusted operating margin, reflecting improved cost management and higher-margin government contracts.\nWait for the Right Time to Buy\nPalantir's latest guidance suggests a 3% sequential increase in revenues for the third quarter of 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in business growth in the latter half of the year. Nevertheless, the company's agility in AI-led information warfare and cybersecurity continues to position it for sustained growth amidst evolving global security needs.\nHowever, given the stock's current high valuation based on EV-to-EBITDA and Price/Earnings ratios, it might be prudent for investors to wait for a potential market correction, especially when PLTR does not seem poised for an earnings beat. Palantir remains fundamentally strong, but a better entry point could emerge if the stock undergoes some price adjustment.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

NVIDIA shares have skyrocketed 168.1% YTD, outperforming the industry\u2019s surge of 128.8%.

Given this outperformance and attractive valuation, investors might be wondering if there is still an opportunity to buy NVDA stock.\nYTD Price Return Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhy NVIDIA Stock Has Room to Run\nNVIDIA\u2019s rapid rise is largely attributed to its pivotal role in the booming field of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in generative AI. The demand for generative AI applications, which enhance productivity across industries, is anticipated to skyrocket. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is expected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032. This exponential market growth is expected to drive demand for NVIDIA\u2019s high-performance graphic processing units (GPUs), which are fundamental to AI advancements.\nNVIDIA\u2019s cutting-edge GPUs deliver exceptional computational power, enabling AI models to scale effectively. These next-generation chips are fast becoming indispensable for businesses investing in AI. NVIDIA\u2019s superior technology offers unmatched processing capabilities vital for the complex computations AI requires. As businesses increasingly invest in AI infrastructure, NVIDIA stands to benefit as the dominant provider of the technology underpinning these applications.\nGrowth Beyond AI: Diverse Applications Fuel NVIDIA's Future\nNVIDIA\u2019s influence extends well beyond AI.

In healthcare, NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are revolutionizing medical diagnostics, enhancing imaging processes and improving patient care. This broad, multi-industry applicability positions NVIDIA as a resilient and diverse growth engine in the tech landscape.\nStory Continues\nMoreover, NVIDIA\u2019s robust data center solutions are gaining traction. As companies invest in cloud and edge computing, demand for powerful data center infrastructure rises, making NVIDIA\u2019s data center business a critical growth driver. This sector alone is projected to significantly boost the company\u2019s revenues as businesses accelerate their digital transformation efforts, solidifying NVIDIA\u2019s long-term growth potential.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Financial Strength and Impressive Outlook\nNVIDIA\u2019s financial performance has been outstanding. In its second-quarter fiscal 2025 report, the company posted a massive 122% year-over-year revenue increase, accompanied by a 152% jump in non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS). This financial strength highlights NVIDIA\u2019s ability to capitalize on strong demand while navigating market competition effectively.\nFor the upcoming third quarter, NVIDIA\u2019s revenues are expected to surge to $32.5 billion, up from $18.12 billion in the same quarter last year, underscoring its growth trajectory and position as a critical player in semiconductor technology for AI. Looking forward, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues and earnings points to sustained growth, reflecting confidence in the company\u2019s market leadership across multiple sectors, including gaming, automotive and professional visualization.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA\u2019s financial stability is a significant advantage. The company ended July 2024 with a cash reserve of $34.8 billion, up from $31.44 billion in April. This solid balance sheet enables NVIDIA to weather potential market fluctuations and supports continued investments in its growth initiatives. In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, this financial strength provides NVIDIA with a strategic advantage, positioning it to capitalize on future growth opportunities.\nConclusion: Buy NVIDIA Stock Now\nNVIDIA\u2019s dominant position in AI, coupled with its financial strength, broad market applications and attractive valuation, makes it a compelling buy.

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN) stock closed 6% higher on Friday after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected.\nThe company said on Thursday that it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecast $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said operating income is expected to be between $16 billion and $20 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall Street had projected $17.49 billion.\nIn the third quarter, Amazon posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon's closely tracked Amazon Web Services unit tallied revenue of $27.45 billion in the quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street's projections.\n\"You've got the ingredients you needed for the stock to go up,\" Arun Sundaram, CFRA senior equity research analyst, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nSundaram pointed to Amazon's 11% operating margin, which came in above Wall Street's expectations of 9.34%, as another key driver of the stock's move higher after hours. Arun noted that Amazon is able to pull on other levers in its business, like its e-commerce unit or advertising, to help grow margins while it spends on AI.\nAmazon's earnings follow a volatile few trading sessions for Big Tech companies amid other earnings reports as artificial intelligence spending and how each company is managing it has been in particular focus. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines and posted impressive gains in its cloud and advertising segments, business lines that compete with Amazon.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft and Meta (META) had a tougher going. The stocks of both tech giants fell after their earnings Thursday, as investors were spooked by an increase in AI spending, despite both companies beating expectations after the bell on Wednesday.\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth in 2025. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend \"more than that\" in 2025. In 2023, Amazon's capital expenditures were $48.4 billion. Jassy said the increased spending is driven by generative AI, which he described as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\n\"The faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware,\" Jassy said on the earnings call when explaining why spending continues to grow. \"And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all that up front, in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources.\"\nStory Continues\nJassy added, \"I think, as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon's lucrative cloud business is expected to generate close to $28 billion in the third quarter as the company attracts more clients with new AI services.

The company posted profit and sales increases of 37% and 15%, respectively, compared to the year prior.\nEven as investors in recent months have expressed some impatience with the tech industry's enormous investments in AI technology, Google showed that a dominant performance of its core business can alleviate those concerns.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAmazon, too, offered a resounding earnings beat. The company posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. The stellar report helped offset lingering concerns about mounting capital expenditures.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call Thursday that \"as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and Jassy said the company plans to spend \"more than that\" in 2025.\nThe e-commerce giant's approach to selling AI spending was also helped by claims that new revenue has already arrived. While Amazon has not disclosed exact figures for AI-related sales, Jassy has said the AI business inside of its cloud unit has generated several billion dollars. And on Thursday he added that the business is growing at a \"triple-digit year-over-year percentage.\u201d\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy expects to spend even more money in 2025 on capital expenditures, driven by the development of AI technology. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut investors have not given all the big-spending tech companies the same leeway when it comes to ballooning capital expenditures.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) were met with a more unforgiving investor response this week, even as both tech giants beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue. Investors sent both stocks lower after their respective reports. Wall Street recoiled after executives of both companies said they expect capex to continue increasing in the quarters to come.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth next year and revised its expectation upward for 2024 capex. The uneasiness among investors harkens back to Facebook's prior spending spree, when Reality Labs lost more than $13 billion and shares in the company tanked 60% in 2022. Zuckerberg has since improved the company's financials and its standing on Wall Street, but he's also prompted a fresh round of jitters.\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's boosted AI spending came with its own troublesome news: The company said it expects slower growth in its cloud business, highlighting the risks of dedicating major resources to AI development without the returns to offset them.\nBoth Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have framed their spending on AI as worthwhile endeavors, helping to massage the worries of investing in a new technology with uncertain returns. Earlier this year Pichai addressed Wall Street's fears head on: \"The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.\u201d In his view, spending too much on AI is a small price to pay for claiming a leadership position in a future AI-dominated landscape.\nJassy offered a similar argument on Thursday, describing generative AI as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\nGoogle and Amazon investors appear to be taking them at their word.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about.\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, expressed concerns about the impact of rising bond yields on the stock market, suggesting that this trend could restrict the recent tech rally and limit broader sector gains. On Tuesday, he remarked that the bond market is creating significant disruptions, stating:\n\u201cBonds are wrecking the narrative, driving the people outta everything that works when the Fed cuts rates and they're going right back into tech. That's the opposite of what, if you're a true bull, you want to see.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Game Plan: 20 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\nDespite the Dow experiencing a modest decline of 155 points, the S&P 500 managed a slight increase of 0.16%, while the NASDAQ achieved a record close with a 0.78% rise on Tuesday. Cramer pointed out that the market is becoming increasingly narrow and exclusive, primarily benefiting tech stocks at the expense of broader participation, which he considers unhealthy. Cramer explained that this trend was somewhat anticipated.\nHe recounted how, when news broke about the Fed potentially implementing a 50 basis point rate cut, there was a surge of enthusiasm among investors who began buying bonds. They were betting on a series of rapid rate cuts, leading to expectations that bond yields would fall. Cramer noted, \u201cIt seemed a total legit thing, right? I mean the economy was slowing, that's been the pattern historically.\u201d He added that as inflation began to ease, it appeared that history was repeating itself.\nHowever, following the significant rate cut on September 18th, something unusual occurred: long-term rates rose for the first time since 1995. This shift, which he described as a \u201ctotal buzzkill,\u201d is beginning to manifest in corporate earnings reports. He went on to say:\n\u201cIf the bond market doesn\u2019t start behaving, or at least calming down, if longer-term interest rates don\u2019t stop going up, we\u2019re going to start losing the groups that have led us higher for months now.\u201d\nIn conclusion, Cramer warned:\n\u201cIf it [the bond market] doesn't stop its retreat, then we're gonna start questioning the idea that the Fed will keep cutting rates, ushering in a fabulous economy for 2025, which is what I was looking for.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on October 29. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAlphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nCramer called Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recent earnings report impressive and praised the company\u2019s relatively new CFO.\n\u201cAlphabet, on the other hand, reported an unambiguously fantastic quarter. Anat Ashkenazi, I told you, she'd be good, the CFO used to be over at Lily\u2026 I was worried about Alphabet because there's so many moving parts... although we still own it for the Charitable Trust. This time, Alphabet handily beat the estimates. Big numbers from Google Cloud business\u2026 and strong ad sales for Search, and yes, YouTube. Just an excellent quarter, one that allowed the stock to roar in after-hours trading even though it had already run up into earnings. Very impressive.\u201d\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), established as the parent company of Google following a restructuring in 2015, continues to demonstrate significant growth across its various business segments. On October 29, the company released its third-quarter results, revealing noteworthy financial metrics. Net income experienced a remarkable increase of 34%, with earnings per share rising by 37% to reach $2.12.\nAlphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) consolidated revenues reached $88.3 billion, marking a 15% increase, or 16% when adjusted for constant currency, compared to the same quarter the previous year. Google Cloud reported substantial revenue growth of 35%, totaling $11.4 billion.\nThis growth was driven by accelerated advancements in areas such as AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core Google Cloud Platform products, indicating a significant shift toward cloud services in the tech industry. Additionally, YouTube has also made significant strides, with total ad and subscription revenues surpassing $50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%.\nAnd in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close.\nDisney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks.\n\"Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,\" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance.\nOther analysts have piled onto that thinking, declaring the infamous streaming wars officially over.\n\"Netflix won the streaming wars,\" MoffettNathanson, one of the leading equity research firms for the tech and media sector, said in a note penned by analyst Robert Fishman last week. \"The media space right now is defined by a dichotomy in which Netflix stands as a lone exception.\"\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan agreed, recently telling Yahoo Finance's Market Domination that the company has \"undoubtedly\" secured its No. 1 position.\nHow we got here\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and, most importantly, subscribers.\nThe goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\nStory Continues\nAt the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. \"Bridgerton\" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.\nOthers soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for \"The Office\" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time.\nNetflix CEO Ted Sarandos (C) poses with cast and crew as they arrive for Netflix's \"Bridgerton Season 3\" premiere at Alice Tully Hall on May 13, 2024, in New York City. (ANDREA RENAULT / AFP) \u00b7 ANDREA RENAULT via Getty Images\nBut investors quickly realized that streaming is a tough business. It's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. Case in point: the profit struggles at Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount, among others.\nNetflix, viewed by even its competitors as \"the gold standard\" in streaming, has consistently had the upper hand due to its first-mover advantage as a pure-play streaming company. Its innovative approach to monetization, which includes controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, has also helped boost its positioning.\nAs the market stands today, Netflix's total enterprise value is now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined. Its viewed as a growth stock on Wall Street with full-year revenue expected to climb over 15% year over year.\nAnd as the chart below shows, Netflix's estimated enterprise multiple, which is a ratio used to determine the value of a company after taking into account debt and cash levels, in addition to stock price and cash profitability, comes second only to tech giant Apple. Not too shabby for a pure-play streaming player.\nCatching up to Netflix\nFishman argued in his note that a handful of key assets will be needed for streaming players to not only catch up to Netflix but to survive the industry's massive transition.\nThis includes a scaled streaming service (both in the US and globally), a free advertising video-on-demand (AVOD) platform, top-tier sports rights, a US broadcast network, and film and television studios.\nNot every company will need each one of these assets. But having any can boost a company's respective position within the industry.\nTake Disney (DIS), for example. The media conglomerate checks off every box except a free AVOD platform. But having a scaled streaming service in the US and abroad, like Netflix has, appears to be the formula to success \u2014 at least in the current moment.\n\"That really is, it seems, the end goal,\" Fishman said. \"Whether a company wants that for its own sake (all the traditional players) or to augment sales of toilet paper or cellphones [like Amazon], that is the goal.\"\nThat means joint ventures and other deals like acquisitions will be likely outcomes heading into the back half of the decade.\nParamount (PARA) has already agreed to merge with Skydance Media in a deal that's set to mark an end to the Redstone family's control of the company. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025.\nRegulatory challenges could be an overhang, however. A judge temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), citing antitrust concerns.\nThe Big Tech giants would face similar dealmaking hurdles given their size, while media companies combining with each other would pose its own risk as nearly all of the top players carry heavy debt loads.\nIn his report, Fishman said Fox and WBD have the most complementary assets for a possible combination, especially since WBD lacks the NFL and most recently lost the NBA. The company is currently tied up in litigation after suing the NBA over the loss of those media rights.\nNetflix has won the streaming wars, but where does that leave everyone else? (Getty Images) \u00b7 SimpleImages via Getty Images\nTo that point, sports has emerged as the final frontier of streaming amid a dying cable TV business. But professional leagues have also been hesitant to fully abandon traditional television.\nThat gives the upper hand to companies with a broadcast network like Fox, Comcast and Disney, in Fishman's view.\n\"While leagues are also increasingly comfortable partnering with streamers, as the NFL Thursday Night Football transition from Fox to Amazon showed, doing so still presents a tradeoff in viewership,\" Fishman pointed out. \"Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners.\"\nAnd as new data shows, companies with exposure to both traditional television and streaming typically capture the most eyeballs.\nDisney's traditional broadcast and streaming properties accounted for a combined 11.3% of overall TV viewing time during the month of September, according to the latest Gauge report from Nielsen.\nGoogle's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Netflix rounded out the top five at 10.6%, 9.3%, 8.2%, and 7.9%, respectively.\nLooking ahead, \"Disney has the right asset mix to establish a true second global streaming service after Netflix,\" Fishman predicted. Disney, which is in the midst of finding its next CEO with Bob Iger's contract set to expire at the end of 2026, will report quarterly earnings on Nov. 14.\nBut he warned the rest of traditional media companies like Comcast, Paramount, and Warner Bros. \"still need to quickly determine which path to take in order to better position themselves within the great streaming game\" \u2014 whether that means a merger, asset sale, acquisition, partnership, or something else altogether.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Each company has invested heavily in AI, data storage, and innovative technologies to attract business clients and capture greater market share. Today, Amazon leads the group in cloud market share with 31% of the market, then Microsoft with 20% followed by Alphabet with 12%.\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, in the third quarter of 2024, spending on global cloud infrastructure services surged by $15.7 billion, or 23%, over the same period in 2023, reaching over $84 billion for the quarter ending September 30. Over the last year, revenue from cloud infrastructure services hit $313 billion, underscoring the intense competition in this sector. Despite its massive scale, the cloud market continues to expand rapidly, with year-over-year (YoY) growth accelerating for the fourth straight quarter.\nAll three of these stocks reported earnings this week, with the results of their cloud services segments under the microscope. Amazon and Alphabet had positive reactions to their earnings results, while Microsoft saw some selling following its meeting. All companies had very positive results though, beating sales and earnings estimates. Also notable, Amazon stock has outperformed the market year-to-date (YTD), while Alphabet is about in line with market performance and Microsoft below.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMZN, GOOGL and MSFT Earnings Revisions\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have each made significant strides in cloud computing, but their earnings revision trends and growth forecasts tell slightly different stories. Both Amazon and Microsoft currently hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a relatively flat earnings revision trend. On the other hand, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting a more favorable outlook driven by recent upward revisions to its earnings estimates.\nLooking at long-term earnings growth projections, Amazon stands out with an anticipated annual growth rate of 27.2% over the next three to five years led by AWS. Alphabet\u2019s expected growth rate of 17.6% per year reflects its continued growth in cloud services, YouTube and now self-driving with Waymo, while Microsoft, expected to grow at 14.7% annually, showcases steady gains in both its cloud and software offerings, including Azure and Office 365.\nTheir valuation also offers valuable insight into what investors can expect going forward. Today, Alphabet is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.4x which is below its 10-year median of 25.8x, Amazon at 38.4x is also below its 10-year median of 92.4x and Microsoft at 31.2x is above its 10-year median of 26.5x.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMZN, GOOGL or MSFT: Which Shares Should Investors Buy?\nFor investors seeking the best mix of growth potential and value, GOOGL and AMZN stand out as the most attractive choices among the cloud giants. Both companies not only boast strong earnings growth projections\u2014with Amazon leading the group\u2014but also offer relatively appealing valuations compared to Microsoft discounting for growth forecasts and historical valuations.\nAlphabet\u2019s recent performance in the cloud segment and ongoing investments in AI and self-driving cars show huge promise, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio remains appealing given its growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s growth prospects are bolstered by its dominant position in e-commerce and the ever-expanding AWS, which remains a leader in the cloud infrastructure market. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s valuation is more favorable relative to its growth rate and historical average, making it an attractive option for those focused on long-term potential.\nIn contrast, Microsoft\u2019s substantial capital expenditures on AI and other tech advancements\u2014though expected to drive future growth\u2014have been flagged as a point of concern for now. While Microsoft remains a cloud and AI powerhouse, these elevated costs could temper near-term returns, making it comparatively less compelling at current valuations.\nOverall, Alphabet and Amazon\u2019s mix of robust growth forecasts and favorable valuations make them top picks in the cloud landscape for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Confronting company executives is already a daunting prospect. Asking them sticky questions while they\u2019re dressed in costume is downright spooky. But such was the case for Google employees who attended the tech giant\u2019s all-hands meeting Wednesday.\nAhead of Halloween, Alphabet gathered employees to discuss company earnings posted late Tuesday. Revenue increased 15% to $88.27 billion, primarily due to Google\u2019s steep investments in AI that rocketed sales of its Cloud functions.\nExecutives were dressed for the occasion, including CEO Sundar Pichai, who wore a a T-shirt reading, \u201cERROR 404 COSTUME NOT FOUND\u201d accompanied by a pixelated dinosaur illustration; CFO Anat Ashkenazi, who wore the basketball jersey of retired Indiana Pacers star Reggie Miller; and chief scientist Jeff Dean, who was dressed as a starfish, CNBC reported.\nA Google spokesperson confirmed to Fortune that some execs were in costume during the regularly scheduled quarterly meeting, where they answered over 20 questions from employees ranging from products to cost cutting. Google said it\u2019s continuing to hire for priority roles.\nBut the costumes appeared to do little to assuage the tension some employees felt following the earnings call, which alluded to impending cost cuts. Employees reportedly asked about retention and opportunities for promotion.\n\u201cThere is a reality to it,\u201d Brian Ong, vice president of Google recruiting, said in the meeting, according to a recording reviewed by CNBC. \u201cWe are hiring less than we did a couple of years ago.\u201d\nTenuous tech jobs\nAshkenazi, who replaced former CFO Ruth Porat, also hinted about cost cuts. Google has been successful in its cost-saving and efficiency-increasing measures, but \"any organization can always push a little further,\" Ashkenazi said. The comments mirrored those of Pichai at the beginning of the year, when he warned that Google\u2019s \u201cambitious goals\u201d also require job cuts.\nGoogle employees are familiar with the uncertain outcomes cost-saving strategies can take. Despite recent success for Google\u2019s Cloud, the unit also conducted sweeping layoffs in May, reportedly letting go of fewer than 100 employees. Google has 1,000 fewer employees this year compared to the same period last year, Fortune previously reported.\nBig tech is experiencing its slowest earnings growth in six quarters, and the industry hasn\u2019t been immune from mass layoffs, which have surpassed 130,000 cuts this year, including 3,765 across the sector in September, and 528 from DropBox alone announced earlier this week.\nGoogle\u2019s big AI investment push may continue to shake up headcount and team sizes, Pichai admitted, announcing during the earnings call that over 25% of Google code is now written by AI. But internal AI use is one way to increase workplace efficiency and cut back on costs, Ashkenazi argued.\nStory Continues\n\"Think not just about the size of the organization but mostly how we operate and how we run the business,\" Ashkenazi said during the earnings presentation. \"I think when you simplify the organization\u2026when we use AI within our own processes and how we get work done, there are some efficiencies or opportunities for efficiencies.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Multiple analysts rerated Uber Technologies, Inc (NYSE:UBER) after Thursday\u2019s quarterly print amid an exciting earnings season.\nThe ride-hailing giant reported fiscal third-quarter 2024 revenue growth of 20% to $11.188 billion, topping the\u00a0analyst consensus of $10.97 billion.\nRevenue from Mobility grew to $6.41 billion, up 26%. Delivery\u00a0was $3.47 billion, up 18%, and Freight was $1.31 billion, up 2%.\nAlso Read: Nvidia\u2019s Run:ai Acquisition Draws European Regulatory Scrutiny On Competition Concerns\nJMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone maintained Uber with a Market Outperform and raised the price target from\u00a0$80\u00a0to\u00a0$95.\nKeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson reiterated Uber with an Overweight and lowered the price target from\u00a0$90\u00a0to\u00a0$85.\nBenchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos maintained Uber with a Hold.\nTruist analyst\u00a0Youssef Squali reiterated a Buy on Uber and lowered the price target\u00a0to $95 from $99.\nBMO analyst Brian J. Pitz maintained an Outperform on Uber with a price target of $92.\nNeedham analyst Bernie McTernan reiterated a Buy and a price target of $90.\nRBC analyst Brad Erickson maintained an Outperform on Uber with a price target of $82, up from $80.\nBofA analyst Justin Post reiterated a Buy and a price target of $93, down from $96.\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt maintained an Outperform on Uber with a price target of $86.\nJMP Securities: Boone evaluated Uber following its mixed third-quarter results, which revealed gross bookings of $41 billion, slightly underperforming consensus by about 1%, while adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of guidance by $10 million. Although Uber\u2019s stock surged 22% since its last earnings report, these latest results fell short of market expectations, leading to a 9% decline in the share price.\nThe analyst noted this dip as an opportunity, considering Uber\u2019s early-stage growth potential in its Mobility and Delivery sectors, especially as nearly half of the U.S. population still lacks reliable on-demand services. The raised target reflects Uber\u2019s strong market positioning, cost discipline, and evolving product mix.\nKeyBanc: Patterson\u2019s price target revision reflects caution over slower growth in Mobility gross bookings and trips in the third quarter, suggesting the Mobility segment may be moderating. The analyst attributes this partly to expanding lower-priced services and easing insurance inflation, which will likely stabilize in the coming quarters.\nDelivery growth has been stable for four consecutive quarters, with a 17% year-over-year rise in the third quarter, suggesting sustained momentum. Second, Uber has shown margin expansion, with record quarterly margins for both Mobility and Delivery in the third quarter. Patterson expects the company to continue leveraging fixed costs, with advertising and improved unit economics adding further support.\nStory Continues\nUber\u2019s autonomous vehicle (AV) strategy also shows promise, with new AV partnerships positioned to capture market opportunities. He noted that an international AV partnership could launch later this year, with the expanded Waymo collaboration expected by early 2025.\nBenchmark: Uber faced a challenging session Thursday, as shares slid amid disappointment over its third-quarter gross bookings, particularly within Mobility. Kurnos raised questions about Uber\u2019s growth prospects in ride frequency, especially across North America, which showed signs of slowing. Anticipation around earnings had been high, but Uber\u2019s performance fell short, with pressure amplified by strong competitor results and new market partnerships. As per the analyst, these may affect Uber\u2019s long-term position, especially regarding AV developments.\nNot all metrics disappointed, though\u2014he noted that Uber outperformed on revenue and adjusted EBITDA, underscoring improved operational efficiency across its portfolio. Additionally, Uber reported significant membership growth, which could foreshadow a rebound in frequency gains, as per Kurnos. Management pointed to substantial growth opportunities in less urbanized parts of mature markets, aligning with projections of these regions as critical drivers for the company over the next few years.\nWhile Mobility\u2019s deceleration is evident in Uber\u2019s fourth-quarter outlook, the analyst said guidance for the quarter as a whole met or exceeded expectations. Although market share questions persist with AV competition scaling up, Uber\u2019s expanded partnership with Waymo is seen as a positive indicator, according to him. Kurnos remains optimistic about Uber\u2019s medium-term fundamentals, noting the growing profitability in grocery delivery and untapped potential in international markets.\nNeedham: McTernan rerated after Uber reported mixed third-quarter results, while fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance fell short of consensus. Uber reported its fifth consecutive quarter of 20% bookings growth, with Mobility leading at 24%.\nDespite a slight expected slowdown due to tougher comparisons, the analyst noted the current pace as a strong foundation for earnings growth in 2025. He also flagged Uber\u2019s increased emphasis on share repurchases, projected to reduce share count starting in 2025, which will significantly boost EPS and free cash flow (FCF) per share, estimated to reach $3 and over $4 in 2026, respectively.\nKey takeaways include Uber\u2019s focus on maintaining balanced growth through user and frequency increases, with subscriptions and multi-product options contributing more steadily. McTernan anticipated robust capital allocation with buybacks forecasted at nearly $5 billion in 2025, alongside consistent FCF growth.\nRBC: Erickson noted the market\u2019s reaction as excessive and suggested it presents a buying opportunity.\nKey positive factors include Uber\u2019s focused expansion into international markets and suburbs, with high demand for low-cost rides. The Delivery segment is also performing well, with new verticals contributing significantly to growth. Uber\u2019s loyalty program, Uber One, reached 25 million members, accounting for 35% of total bookings. Additionally, Erickson noted Uber\u2019s AV strategy, including its partnership with Waymo, positions the company to capitalize on the AV market.\nDespite some demand pressure from insurance costs, the analyst remains optimistic about Uber\u2019s long-term growth trajectory, expecting a solid performance from both user engagement and suburban market penetration.\nBofA: Uber reported overall solid results, with Bookings, revenue, and EBITDA of $41 billion, $11.19 billion, and $1.69 billion, respectively, mostly above Street estimates. The analyst noted that Quarterly GAAP Operating Income reached $1 billion, though Mobility bookings fell short by 2%, impacted by demand sensitivity to insurance-related price increases in some U.S. cities.\nUber One subscribers grew to 25 million, contributing 35% of total bookings, highlighting Uber\u2019s expanding network effect. Fourth-quarter guidance aligns with Street expectations, although the upper end of EBITDA guidance suggests a slight decline in incremental margins. Post noted that while Waymo\u2019s presence in San Francisco may have raised concerns, it represents a small market for Uber, and the Waymo partnership will likely scale in 2025.\nWith steady margin improvements and 30% projected EBITDA growth over two years, the analyst noted Uber\u2019s EBITDA potentially reaching $11 billion by 2026. The price target reflects a slightly lower growth outlook but remains supported by Uber\u2019s long-term earnings and free cash flow potential.\nWedbush: Uber reported mixed third-quarter results and provided guidance for fourth-quarter that aligned with expectations, Devitt noted.\nDevitt flagged that Uber continues to deliver solid growth and margin expansion, but expectations have risen accordingly, and the magnitude of profit beats has normalized in recent quarters.\nShares were down, reflecting slightly slower booking growth and adjusted EBITDA guidance that likely did not clear investor expectations despite being in line with consensus at the midpoint of the guide, as per the analyst.\nStill, he noted Uber is well positioned to deliver mid-teens bookings growth over the intermediate term with rising margins and strong free cash flow conversion (~90% of adjusted EBITDA).\nOn the call, Devitt will focus on management commentary on AVs and recent partnerships, near-term demand trends and macro commentary, and drivers of growth and margin expansion in 2025.\nPrice Action: UBER stock is up 2.20% at $73.64 at\u00a0the last check on Friday.\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nAlso Read:\nFuboTV Q3 Earnings: Subscribers Grow 9% To 1.61 Million, Narrows EPS Loss, Raises Annual Outlook\nLatest Ratings for UBER\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nLoop Capital\nMaintains\nBuy\nMar 2022\nDeutsche Bank\nInitiates Coverage On\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nWedbush\nMaintains\nOutperform\nView More Analyst Ratings for UBER\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

          "whole_article": "Jim Cramer, the well-known stock market commentator, set social media buzzing this week after he tweeted about Reddit\u2019s stellar earnings report, putting it on par with Google\u2019s results.\nCramer acknowledged that it\u2019s difficult to determine which of the two tech behemoths made more money, referring to Reddit\u2019s revenues as \u201camazing.\u201d Considering Google\u2019s dominance in the tech industry, this is quite the endorsement.\n\n\nDon't Miss:\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $1,000\nCramer's tweet may seem surprising, especially as Google has long been one of the world's tech giants. However, it shows how Reddit has evolved into a successful company that can contend for investors\u2019 and users\u2019 attention.\nBoth businesses produced impressive third-quarter earnings that surpassed forecasts, which prompted the comparison. Despite an anticipated loss of 8 cents per share, Reddit\u2019s performance has been good, with earnings of 16 cents per share.\nRevenue also surpassed estimates, coming in at $348.4 million, and the company\u2019s gross margin improved to 90.1%. Perhaps the most noteworthy figure was the 47% rise in daily active users to 97.2 million. For the first time since its March IPO, Reddit turned a profit.\nSee Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nWall Street was also captivated by Reddit\u2019s optimistic outlook. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue between $385 million and $400 million, outpacing the analyst estimate of $356.7 million.\nAs a result of Reddit\u2019s impressive performance, analysts promptly modified their projections. Roth MKM increased from $89 to $116, Piper Sandler from $70 to $115, and\nNeedham increased its price objective from $85 to $120.\nHowever, Google also had a fantastic quarter. The tech behemoth beat analyst projections of $1.83 per share with earnings of $2.12 per share. Cloud revenue increased 35% year over year to $11.4 billion, contributing to the $88.27 billion in revenue. Advertising revenue also rose, beating estimates at $65.85 billion.\nStory Continues\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nThe appeal of new AI features like AI Overviews, which currently serve 1 billion users each month, and the robust growth of Google\u2019s cloud business was highlighted by CEO Sundar Pichai.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss.\nOn October 31, CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach joined \u2018Money Movers\u2019 to discuss big tech\u2019s AI spending. Kovach observes that, apart from ChatGPT, no other AI product has achieved a breakthrough, despite ongoing efforts from many companies. Currently, most of the money is going to chip makers and cloud businesses, and there is no evidence of meaningful sales or engagement around AI products that people may want to use every day. Kovach's observation implies that tech giants continue to invest heavily in foundational AI advancements and that high-engagement consumer products may still have time to launch. Additionally, many of these big tech companies have reported that they will continue to step up their already high spending on AI infrastructure.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News You Should Not Miss\u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\nFor many like Kovach, OpenAI represents the leading and most mainstream AI breakthrough, with each of its moves highly anticipated. After all, the company is widely credited for bringing artificial intelligence tools into widespread use. In its latest breakthrough, OpenAI has launched \"ChatGPT Search\u201d, the company's new search engine, positioning the high-powered AI startup to compete with search engines like Bing, Perplexity, and Google. This search feature within ChatGPT provides up-to-the-minute sports scores, stock quotes, weather, and more, driven by real-time web searches and partnerships with news and data providers.\n\u201cI find it to be a way faster/easier way to get the information I\u2019m looking for. I think we\u2019ll see this especially for queries that require more complex research. I also look forward to a future where a search query can dynamically render a custom web page in response!\u201d\nIn a notable advancement towards more accessible AI products and services, SpotAI, a leader in AI camera systems, announced the launch of its Video AI Agents. The announcement strives to bring agentic AI capabilities from the digital to the physical world. These agents assist organizations in identifying and resolving incidents, offering measurable ROI in sectors such as manufacturing, education, retail, and automotive services; all without the need for human intervention.\nIn a similar development within the AI landscape, OSARO, a global leader in machine-learning-enabled robotics for high-volume fulfillment centers, has launched OSARO AutoModel. The OSARO AutoModel allows robots to automatically learn and adapt to new items, processes, and workflows with zero downtime; unlike previous robots that need updating for new SKUs.\nStory Continues\nContinuing the trend of leveraging artificial intelligence in our increasingly AI-driven world, Bolster, a leader in multi-channel phishing protection, announced on Thursday its newest feature called Bolster AI Security for Email. The Bolster AI Security for Email automates the analysis and mitigation of cyber threats reported through customer abuse mailboxes. The new feature combines crowdsourced customer reports and AI-driven automation to protect brands from fraud schemes in real-time.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an American multinational technology conglomerate and the parent holding company of Google. The company is a strong player in the AI sector, innovating at \u201cevery layer of the AI stack, from chips to agents and beyond\u201d.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced its third-quarter results on October 29, 2024. The company beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, driven by strong growth in its cloud business. In particular, Google CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the growth of the cloud unit, noting that the company's AI portfolio is enticing new customers and leading to larger deals. Cloud revenue for the quarter was $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, surpassing expectations. The excitement and potential around artificial intelligence means Google is all in on the AI craze, and it\u2019s certainly helping its productivity, too. In the earnings call, Pichai noted how more than a quarter of new code created at Google is generated by AI. Using AI for coding has been boosting productivity and efficiency for the company.\n\u201cMore than a quarter of all new code at Google is generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers\u201d.\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A: Scott Peyree, COO and President of Marketplace Businesses, explained that the insurance industry is in a strong position and expects continued growth over the next 18 months. While the growth rate may not match the recent quarters, demand remains high. LendingTree differentiates itself with a diverse range of products and a broad client base, allowing it to generate revenue and offer consumer options effectively.\nQ: How is LendingTree handling SEO headwinds from Google changes and AI developments? A: CEO Douglas Lebda stated that LendingTree aims to be independent of traffic sources, including Google's SEO rankings. They focus on maintaining a balanced view of customer acquisition channels and improving their SEO strategies. Scott Peyree added that LendingTree partners closely with Google on paid search, leveraging AI-based bidding algorithms, and is not experiencing traffic headwinds.\nStory Continues\nQ: What is the outlook for variable marketing margins (VMM) in the insurance segment? A: Douglas Lebda noted that as LendingTree increases marketing spend to drive volume, the cost of acquiring the next leg of volume will be higher. Scott Peyree added that Q3 was likely a trough for VMM, and they expect margins to improve slightly in Q4. Long-term, they aim for low to mid-30s margins in a stable insurance environment.\nQ: How should we think about sequential changes in revenue and segment margins for Q4? A: CFO Jason Bengel explained that the home segment is expected to offset typical seasonal declines due to strong home equity performance. Consumer segment margins are expected to hold, with normal seasonal declines in revenue. Insurance margins are expected to be flat to slightly improving, despite typical seasonal declines.\nQ: Are there any updates on the mortgage front, particularly regarding refinance opportunities? A: Douglas Lebda mentioned that as interest rates normalize, the pool of consumers benefiting from refinancing will increase, improving unit economics. While there is no large-scale consumer rush yet, the market is healthy and expected to return to normal interest rates and refinancing activity next year.\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The online retail operation, which sputtered coming out of the pandemic, grew unit sales by double digits. So did revenue at Amazon\u2019s fast-growing advertising business.\nTotal third-quarter revenue increased 11% to $158.9 billion, the company said Thursday in a statement, exceeding estimates. Operating profit was $17.4 billion, demolishing the average estimate of $14.7 billion.\n\u201cAmazon beat expectations in Q3 on the strength of the three pillars of its business: e-commerce, advertising and cloud services,\u201d said Sky Canaves, an analyst at Emarketer.\nAmazon shares rose 7.3% to $200, the most since February, as the markets opened in New York on Friday. The stock had increased 23% this year through Thursday\u2019s close.\nThe results show the fruits of Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy\u2019s years-long push to cut costs and streamline Amazon\u2019s logistics operation. That has given him room to spend heavily on the new data centers required for the boom in demand for artificial intelligence services. Speaking to analysts on a conference call after the results, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Amazon expects to devote a whopping $75 billion to capital expenditures in 2024, the majority of which will go toward technology infrastructure. Jassy said he expected the company to spend even more next year.\nThe CEO called generative AI \u201ca really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.

Operating income generated by the unit was $10.4 billion, exceeding analysts\u2019 average projection of $9.12 billion.\n\u201cPeople tend to get a little uptight when Amazon talks about ramped up spending, but they\u2019ve got such a great track record of spending large sums of money and getting really good returns on that,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co.\nStory Continues\nAmazon\u2019s key cloud rivals, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp., diverged sharply when they reported earnings earlier this week. Google posted quarterly cloud sales that grew more than analysts had projected, rising to $11.4 billion, a 35% increase from the year-earlier period. Microsoft, meanwhile, forecast slower quarterly cloud revenue growth, reflecting the company\u2019s struggle to bring data centers online fast enough to keep up with demand for AI services.\nAmazon reported revenue from the online store unit increased 7% to $61.4 billion in the period ended Sept. 30, while sales at the fast-growing advertising unit rose 19% from a year earlier to $14.3 billion.\nTotal operating expenses rose 7.2% to $141.5 billion \u2014 marking the seventh consecutive quarter that Amazon\u2019s revenue increased at a higher rate than costs. The company\u2019s workforce rose 3% to more than 1.55 million full- and part-time employees.\nThe Seattle-based company also projected strong growth in the quarter ending in December. Operating income will be about $18 billion, topping analysts\u2019 average estimate of $17.5 billion. Fourth-quarter sales will be as much as $188.5 billion.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bob Bertz, Chief Financial Officer of Marin Software. Thank you. You may begin.\nRobert Bertz\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Marin Software's third-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Bob Bertz. I'm Marin's CFO, and joining me today is Chris Lien, Marin's CEO.\nBy now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release, which crossed the wire a short time ago. The release can also be obtained on our website at investors.marinsoftware.com.\nCall participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being recorded for playback purposes and that the recording will be made available on the Investor Relations section of our website within a few hours.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to note that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements include statements about our business outlook and strategy, our expectations for customer adoption and use of our services, historical results that may suggest trends for our business, our expectations about our ability to improve customer retention and new business bookings and to sustain or grow our business, our expectations about our expenses and cash resources, the impact of investments in product and technology, progress on product development efforts, product capabilities and benefits, our relationships with publishers and other parties in the digital advertising market, and the expected revenue under our strategic agreement with Google, expectations for future economic activity in digital advertising spending, expected restructuring cost and cost savings from our restructuring efforts, our efforts to raise additional financing or to negotiate and complete potential strategic transactions and our expected Q4 2024 and future financial results.\nWe make these statements as of October 31, 2024, and disclaim any duty to update them. For more information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements, as well as risks relating to our business in general, we refer you to the section entitled Risk Factors in our most recent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, as well as our other SEC filings.\nThis presentation contains certain financial performance measures that are different from the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may also be different from similar calculations or measures used by other companies. A quantitative reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is available in our third-quarter 2024 earnings release.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nStory Continues\nChristopher Lien\nThank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. I'll share my observations on the quarter and provide an update on our initiatives to sustain and grow our business. Bob will then provide additional detail on our third-quarter results for 2024 and our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024.\nAs we highlight each quarter, we are committed to sustaining and growing our business and maximizing shareholder value. Our plan to achieve this is focused on delivering a leading cross-channel advertising management platform to enable brands and their agencies to maximize the return from their online advertising investments.\nAs announced in today's earnings release, Q3 revenues came in above our guidance range at $4.3 million, down about 4% year-over-year, as our revenue decline moderates with progress in improving customer retention and new bookings.\nOur Q3 non-GAAP operating loss also beat the high end of our guidance. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $1.1 million lower on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the benefits of our July 2023 restructuring and reduction in force plan.\nOur total cash balance at the end of Q3 was $5.6 million.\nIn mid-October, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we reduced headcount by 26%. The reduction is projected to result in annualized savings of approximately $3.6 million. We took this difficult step to better align our costs with our current revenues and to move Marin closer to breakeven.\nAs we announced last quarter, I am pleased to share that Marin Software has renewed its strategic partnership agreement with Google for another three years, commencing on October 1, 2024. The renewal is substantially similar to the revenue share agreement with Google that expired on September 30, 2024, including the same minimum quarterly payments. This agreement underscores our commitment to fostering innovation and providing advertisers with unparalleled tools for managing and optimizing their page search campaigns.\nAs I've shared before, Marin seeks to be an ally in digital for the world's leading brands and their agencies. The online path to purchase traverses a range of channels, devices, and publishers. Marketers need to engage at all points of this customer journey. And the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and the other publishers including TikTok, Snap, and LinkedIn do not play well together.\nBrands must connect the dots. Marin helps these advertisers to measure, manage, and optimize their online advertising investments, driving performance, time savings, and better business insights.\nWe do this by serving as a performance layer that complements the tools that each of the ad platforms provides to its customers. These ad platform tools are understandably focused on the ad units offered on each platform and encourage brands to spend more within their walled guard.\nThe ad platform tools generally don't compare advertising performance across platforms. They don't highlight opportunities to reallocate spending across platforms to improve performance, nor do they promote a unified view of a customer's journey across channels and devices. We supplement our software with support from our experienced team of digital marketing experts, who can help brands navigate the complex but rewarding world of digital advertising.\nTo address the varying needs of digital marketers and their agencies, we offer three primary products. Connect is a reporting-focused solution for advertisers looking to collect their performance marketing data from various sources and send it to data warehouses, BI tools, and spreadsheets.\nMarin provides marketers with unified revenue, cost, and ad performance data via our Connect offering. Building on the data foundation provided by Connect, Ascend is our budget management, pacing, and forecasting solution. It enables marketers to leverage Marin's AI-based optimization methodologies to deliver budget compliance, understand what-if from increased or decreased advertising spend, and understand optimal spend allocation across campaigns, publishers, and channels.\nAscend supports a range of publishers and channels, including LinkedIn, TikTok, Apple Search Ads, Amazon, Reddit, X, formerly known as Twitter, and Taboola, in addition to Google and Meta. Ascend ensures that budgets are dynamically adjusted to maximize campaign performance without manual intervention.\nAscend complements the robust in-channel publisher bidding and provides an independent measure and means to allocate and pace online advertising investment, delivering optimal financial results and significant time savings compared to alternative manual approaches.\nThis past quarter in Ascend, we introduced new budget floor controls, ensuring campaigns maintain a minimum spend to maximize impact and avoid underperformance due to budget shortfalls. These enhancements provide users with automated budget management that adheres to both maximum and minimum thresholds across all campaigns and publishers.\nAnd I want to highlight a recent Ascend customer success story with Fusion92, one of the Midwest's largest independent media agencies, who utilized Marin's budgeting platform to transform budget compliance for their client, a dental services organization with over 1,500 offices nationwide. In just under two months, they improved budget compliance from 9% to 96%, really outstanding results, saving over 15 hours of manual work per week.\nWe are encouraged to see more advertisers and agencies benefiting from Marin Ascend, as well as growing interest in evaluating Ascend. As I've shared, Ascend is already helping drive both new business and renewals.\nMarin's third offering is MarinOne, our flagship cross-channel advertising management platform. Our goal with MarinOne is to complement publisher tools and allow advertisers to analyze, automate, and optimize their digital marketing campaigns more effectively. MarinOne is designed to enable management at scale for large paid media programs, driving time savings and financial lift.\nAs part of MarinOne, I'm pleased to announce our enhanced Reddit integration, which now supports full campaign management, including budgeting, forecasting, and automation. On top of our existing omnichannel reporting capabilities, marketers can manage their Reddit campaigns with the same precision and ease they apply across other publishers in Marin.\nI've mentioned Marin's work with AI on prior calls, and I'm pleased to share that we continue to advance Advisor, which is Marin's OpenAI-powered virtual teammate. With this, Marin users can interact with the platform in an entirely new way, unlocking the collective knowledge of digital marketing thought leaders and putting their best practices to work with a simple prompt.\nOur new AI-powered virtual assistant allows marketers to streamline their workflow by automating tasks and receiving actionable insights. Powered by OpenAI and integrated with Marin's entire Knowledge Center, Advisor provides real-time performance analysis, recommended actions, and step-by-step guidance, helping users optimize their campaigns directly within Marin's platform.\nAdvisor is Marin's second AI offering, following our ChatGPT-powered anomaly detection reports, designed to identify and summarize performance outliers. These reports are delivered in a concise, easy-to-understand format via email on a daily or weekly basis, enabling marketers to review and address significant deviations in campaign performance quickly. Our team intends to expand the application of AI to optimize online advertising and expects to bring additional innovations to market in the coming quarters.\nAs we've discussed on past calls, our activities to support brands and their agencies take place against an active backdrop of governmental antitrust investigations of the businesses of leading publishers in the digital advertising market at the federal and state levels and in the EU. There is also the possibility of federal legislation to regulate the conduct of the leading publishers, which could benefit Marin's role as an independent ad management platform.\nIn particular, there is a pending Google ad tech antitrust case that will hear closing arguments beginning November 25, 2024, with a ruling from the judge expected in Q1 2025. Any decision by the judge will likely be subject to further hearings and appeals.\nMarin enjoys coopetition relationships with the leading publishers, and we do not expect significant changes in these relationships in the near term. And as you have heard me share on prior calls, you see early but encouraging signs that our latest efforts are resonating more with customers and prospects. Marin can benefit if consumers spend increasing time online and add dollars follow them, creating more need for brands to measure, manage, and optimize these investments to acquire customers and drive revenue outcomes.\nWith the combined online advertising share of Google and Meta below 50% and the growing fragmentation of digital advertising outside of these two leading publishers, be it on Amazon, Apple search ads, LinkedIn, Reddit, or TikTok, we see increasing interest in brands taking a cross-channel approach to their digital advertising investments, leveraging Marin's cross-channel reporting, management at scale, and budget optimization.\nAnd now, Bob will review our third-quarter financial results and our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024.\nRobert Bertz\nThank you, Chris. I'll provide an overview of our third-quarter results and then share our forecast for the fourth quarter of 2024. I'll begin with a review of our income statement.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Marin generated $4.3 million in revenue, which was $0.1 million above the high end of our guidance. Third-quarter 2024 revenue was down approximately 4% when compared to total revenue for the quarter of 2023, indicating a moderation of our revenue decline when compared to prior quarters. The decrease in revenue year-over-year is primarily attributable to the fact that existing customer churn outpaced new bookings. Our geographic split for revenue was approximately 80% US and 20% international for the third quarter of 2024.\nMoving on to our operating results. As a reminder, financial statements and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release issued earlier today.\nOur non-GAAP operating loss was $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to a $2.9 million loss for the third quarter of 2023. The $1.8 million non-GAAP operating loss in Q3 was $0.1 million better than the high end of our guidance due to higher revenue. The decrease in operating losses compared to Q3 2023 is primarily attributable to real-life savings from our restructuring plan implemented during the second half of 2023, which were partially offset by lower revenue in the current period as compared to last year.\nOur non-GAAP operating expense in Q3 2024 of $4.4 million represents a 17% decrease when compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease is attributable to the implementation of our restructuring plan.\nWe ended the quarter with a 103 total headcount globally versus 116 a year ago. The decrease in headcount year-over-year is due to the reduction in force that was commenced in July 2023 as part of our restructuring plan, which was completed in Q4 of 2023. About half of our team is in technology roles, which we believe allows us to continue to deliver new products, features, and functionality to drive results for leading brands and their agencies.\nWe commenced the implementation of a new restructuring plan in October of 2024. This restructuring plan is expected to further reduce our pre-tax cost structure by approximately $3.5 million on an annualized basis, all of which is expected to come from a reduction in force.\nThe reduction in force will reduce our workforce globally by approximately 27 positions, as well as approximately 7 full-time equivalent contractor roles. We expect the restructuring to be completed by the end of this year, and we expect to incur approximately $0.8 million in restructuring costs, substantially all of which relate to severance and other one-time termination benefits.\nIn terms of our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a total cash balance of $5.6 million, as compared to a $7.9 million at the end of the previous quarter. As we have disclosed in our recent SEC filings, we are exploring opportunities to raise additional financing as well as potential strategic transactions, but we cannot provide any assurances about our ability to negotiate or complete any such transaction or the terms or timing of any such transaction.\nMoving on to our outlook. For Q4 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.0 million to $4.2 million, and our non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $1.4 million to $1.1 million.\nThis concludes our call for today. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to updating you again during our Q4 2024 earnings call.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN) stock closed 6% higher on Friday after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected.\nThe company said on Thursday that it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecast $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said operating income is expected to be between $16 billion and $20 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall Street had projected $17.49 billion.\nIn the third quarter, Amazon posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon's closely tracked Amazon Web Services unit tallied revenue of $27.45 billion in the quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street's projections.\n\"You've got the ingredients you needed for the stock to go up,\" Arun Sundaram, CFRA senior equity research analyst, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nSundaram pointed to Amazon's 11% operating margin, which came in above Wall Street's expectations of 9.34%, as another key driver of the stock's move higher after hours. Arun noted that Amazon is able to pull on other levers in its business, like its e-commerce unit or advertising, to help grow margins while it spends on AI.\nAmazon's earnings follow a volatile few trading sessions for Big Tech companies amid other earnings reports as artificial intelligence spending and how each company is managing it has been in particular focus. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines and posted impressive gains in its cloud and advertising segments, business lines that compete with Amazon.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft and Meta (META) had a tougher going. The stocks of both tech giants fell after their earnings Thursday, as investors were spooked by an increase in AI spending, despite both companies beating expectations after the bell on Wednesday.\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth in 2025. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend \"more than that\" in 2025. In 2023, Amazon's capital expenditures were $48.4 billion. Jassy said the increased spending is driven by generative AI, which he described as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\n\"The faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware,\" Jassy said on the earnings call when explaining why spending continues to grow. \"And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all that up front, in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources.\"\nStory Continues\nJassy added, \"I think, as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon's lucrative cloud business is expected to generate close to $28 billion in the third quarter as the company attracts more clients with new AI services.

Courtyards\nChicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow\nIstanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nWillie Phillips, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said artificial intelligence and related technologies hold \u201cgenerational significance\u201d and belong in the US.\n\u201cWe have that opportunity today with regard to data centers, and we should not surrender it,\u201d Phillips said Friday at a highly anticipated FERC technical conference about building data centers next to power plants. \u201cData centers moving overseas due to a lack of power supply and infrastructure or regulatory barriers could cause lost opportunities for economic growth and raise national security concerns for our nation.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s meeting launches the first big discussion at FERC about how to serve data centers, which are poised to drive unprecedented growth in electricity demand. AI is evolving quickly, and the data centers being planned to support it use as much power as entire towns. But building new power plants and transmission lines takes years, and US grids are already under increasing stress from aging infrastructure, the rise of renewable resources and extreme storms.\nThe conference focused on the merits and pitfalls of building data centers next to power plants, often described as \u201cco-location.\u201d In March, Amazon Web Services paid Talen Energy Corp. $650 million for a data center campus adjacent to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. FERC is currently reviewing a complaint from utilities that the deal could lead to higher rates for their customers.\nCritics fear co-location will strain electricity supplies on the power grid and allow deep-pocketed tech giants to avoid paying for infrastructure upgrades, shunting those costs onto consumers. FERC Commissioner Mark Christie pointed to the threat of shortages by 2030 on the largest US grid \u2014 operated by PJM Interconnection \u2014 which covers such data center hot spots as Virginia and Ohio.\n\u201cWe want to serve data centers, absolutely, but we want to be fair to all the other consumers,\u201d Christie said.\nBut co-location would allow companies such as Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to open data centers at a faster pace. Executives from power generators Talen, Vistra Corp. and Constellation Energy Corp. told the conference that data centers can support existing plants and bring on new electricity supplies, noting Microsoft\u2019s recent deal to revive the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Dominion Energy Inc., said its Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut could conceivably be an option for co-location in the future, according to a statement filed to FERC.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have until 2030 to figure this out,\u201d Cole Muller, executive vice president of strategic ventures at Talen, said during the meeting. The rise in electricity demand is coming, and long-term contracts \u201censure the longevity of our power plants,\u201d he said.\n(Updates with more details and comments starting in paragraph five.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nTrump\u2019s Immigration Policy Would Make Food Inflation Even Worse\nHow to End the Backlog of Asylum Cases?

          "whole_article": "The quarterly results this week of Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) provided an AI-era playbook for making investors patiently wait for results on massive infrastructure spending.\nAlphabet dazzled Wall Street on Tuesday with earnings that beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong growth in its cloud business. The company posted profit and sales increases of 37% and 15%, respectively, compared to the year prior.\nEven as investors in recent months have expressed some impatience with the tech industry's enormous investments in AI technology, Google showed that a dominant performance of its core business can alleviate those concerns.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAmazon, too, offered a resounding earnings beat. The company posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. The stellar report helped offset lingering concerns about mounting capital expenditures.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call Thursday that \"as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and Jassy said the company plans to spend \"more than that\" in 2025.\nThe e-commerce giant's approach to selling AI spending was also helped by claims that new revenue has already arrived. While Amazon has not disclosed exact figures for AI-related sales, Jassy has said the AI business inside of its cloud unit has generated several billion dollars. And on Thursday he added that the business is growing at a \"triple-digit year-over-year percentage.\u201d\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy expects to spend even more money in 2025 on capital expenditures, driven by the development of AI technology. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut investors have not given all the big-spending tech companies the same leeway when it comes to ballooning capital expenditures.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) were met with a more unforgiving investor response this week, even as both tech giants beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue. Investors sent both stocks lower after their respective reports. Wall Street recoiled after executives of both companies said they expect capex to continue increasing in the quarters to come.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth next year and revised its expectation upward for 2024 capex. The uneasiness among investors harkens back to Facebook's prior spending spree, when Reality Labs lost more than $13 billion and shares in the company tanked 60% in 2022. Zuckerberg has since improved the company's financials and its standing on Wall Street, but he's also prompted a fresh round of jitters.\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's boosted AI spending came with its own troublesome news: The company said it expects slower growth in its cloud business, highlighting the risks of dedicating major resources to AI development without the returns to offset them.\nBoth Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have framed their spending on AI as worthwhile endeavors, helping to massage the worries of investing in a new technology with uncertain returns. Earlier this year Pichai addressed Wall Street's fears head on: \"The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.\u201d In his view, spending too much on AI is a small price to pay for claiming a leadership position in a future AI-dominated landscape.\nJassy offered a similar argument on Thursday, describing generative AI as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\nGoogle and Amazon investors appear to be taking them at their word.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Each company has invested heavily in AI, data storage, and innovative technologies to attract business clients and capture greater market share. Today, Amazon leads the group in cloud market share with 31% of the market, then Microsoft with 20% followed by Alphabet with 12%.\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, in the third quarter of 2024, spending on global cloud infrastructure services surged by $15.7 billion, or 23%, over the same period in 2023, reaching over $84 billion for the quarter ending September 30. Over the last year, revenue from cloud infrastructure services hit $313 billion, underscoring the intense competition in this sector. Despite its massive scale, the cloud market continues to expand rapidly, with year-over-year (YoY) growth accelerating for the fourth straight quarter.\nAll three of these stocks reported earnings this week, with the results of their cloud services segments under the microscope. Amazon and Alphabet had positive reactions to their earnings results, while Microsoft saw some selling following its meeting. All companies had very positive results though, beating sales and earnings estimates. Also notable, Amazon stock has outperformed the market year-to-date (YTD), while Alphabet is about in line with market performance and Microsoft below.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMZN, GOOGL and MSFT Earnings Revisions\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have each made significant strides in cloud computing, but their earnings revision trends and growth forecasts tell slightly different stories. Both Amazon and Microsoft currently hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a relatively flat earnings revision trend. On the other hand, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting a more favorable outlook driven by recent upward revisions to its earnings estimates.\nLooking at long-term earnings growth projections, Amazon stands out with an anticipated annual growth rate of 27.2% over the next three to five years led by AWS. Alphabet\u2019s expected growth rate of 17.6% per year reflects its continued growth in cloud services, YouTube and now self-driving with Waymo, while Microsoft, expected to grow at 14.7% annually, showcases steady gains in both its cloud and software offerings, including Azure and Office 365.\nTheir valuation also offers valuable insight into what investors can expect going forward. Today, Alphabet is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.4x which is below its 10-year median of 25.8x, Amazon at 38.4x is also below its 10-year median of 92.4x and Microsoft at 31.2x is above its 10-year median of 26.5x.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMZN, GOOGL or MSFT: Which Shares Should Investors Buy?\nFor investors seeking the best mix of growth potential and value, GOOGL and AMZN stand out as the most attractive choices among the cloud giants. Both companies not only boast strong earnings growth projections\u2014with Amazon leading the group\u2014but also offer relatively appealing valuations compared to Microsoft discounting for growth forecasts and historical valuations.\nAlphabet\u2019s recent performance in the cloud segment and ongoing investments in AI and self-driving cars show huge promise, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio remains appealing given its growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s growth prospects are bolstered by its dominant position in e-commerce and the ever-expanding AWS, which remains a leader in the cloud infrastructure market. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s valuation is more favorable relative to its growth rate and historical average, making it an attractive option for those focused on long-term potential.\nIn contrast, Microsoft\u2019s substantial capital expenditures on AI and other tech advancements\u2014though expected to drive future growth\u2014have been flagged as a point of concern for now. While Microsoft remains a cloud and AI powerhouse, these elevated costs could temper near-term returns, making it comparatively less compelling at current valuations.\nOverall, Alphabet and Amazon\u2019s mix of robust growth forecasts and favorable valuations make them top picks in the cloud landscape for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Kovach observes that, apart from ChatGPT, no other AI product has achieved a breakthrough, despite ongoing efforts from many companies. Currently, most of the money is going to chip makers and cloud businesses, and there is no evidence of meaningful sales or engagement around AI products that people may want to use every day. Kovach's observation implies that tech giants continue to invest heavily in foundational AI advancements and that high-engagement consumer products may still have time to launch. Additionally, many of these big tech companies have reported that they will continue to step up their already high spending on AI infrastructure.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News You Should Not Miss\u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\nFor many like Kovach, OpenAI represents the leading and most mainstream AI breakthrough, with each of its moves highly anticipated. After all, the company is widely credited for bringing artificial intelligence tools into widespread use. In its latest breakthrough, OpenAI has launched \"ChatGPT Search\u201d, the company's new search engine, positioning the high-powered AI startup to compete with search engines like Bing, Perplexity, and Google. This search feature within ChatGPT provides up-to-the-minute sports scores, stock quotes, weather, and more, driven by real-time web searches and partnerships with news and data providers.\n\u201cI find it to be a way faster/easier way to get the information I\u2019m looking for.

The announcement strives to bring agentic AI capabilities from the digital to the physical world. These agents assist organizations in identifying and resolving incidents, offering measurable ROI in sectors such as manufacturing, education, retail, and automotive services; all without the need for human intervention.\nIn a similar development within the AI landscape, OSARO, a global leader in machine-learning-enabled robotics for high-volume fulfillment centers, has launched OSARO AutoModel. The OSARO AutoModel allows robots to automatically learn and adapt to new items, processes, and workflows with zero downtime; unlike previous robots that need updating for new SKUs.\nStory Continues\nContinuing the trend of leveraging artificial intelligence in our increasingly AI-driven world, Bolster, a leader in multi-channel phishing protection, announced on Thursday its newest feature called Bolster AI Security for Email. The Bolster AI Security for Email automates the analysis and mitigation of cyber threats reported through customer abuse mailboxes.

It is one of Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI stocks, known for investing heavily in new AI initiatives, its significant investment in OpenAI, and its expanding cloud computing infrastructure.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the bell on October 30, 2024. The company beat top and bottom lines on the back of its cloud business and Office software, with AI leading to gains in its Azure cloud platform. Revenue was $65.6 billion, an increase of 16% and beating analysts' expectations of $64.57 billion, while net income rose 11% to $24.7 billion. The company\u2019s cloud service sales came at $38.9 billion versus expectations of $38.1 billion. Meanwhile, its Intelligent Cloud segment, including its Azure business, raked in $24.1 billion in the quarter, up 20% year over year. However, guidance for the current quarter projects revenue between $68.1 billion and $69.1 billion, suggesting 10.6% growth but falling short of analyst expectations of $69.83 billion. This is largely due to delays from outside suppliers in delivering data center infrastructure, hampering its ability to meet demand.\n\u201cAI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts, and workflow across every role, function, and business process. We are expanding our opportunity and winning new customers as we help them apply our AI platforms and tools to drive new growth and operating leverage.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Intel (INTC) reported its third quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, beating expectations on revenue but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges.\nPositive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher, with the chipmaker's stock up over 8% Friday.\n\u2022 USD\n(INTC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nFor the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion.\nThat\u2019s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year.\nFor the fourth quarter, Intel said it expects revenue of between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $13.6 billion. The company also said it has two new customers for its 18A processor.\nRevenue for the company's data center and AI business came in at $3.35 billion; analysts were looking for $3.1 billion. Intel's Client Computing segment, which deals with the sale of chips for laptops and desktops, brought in revenue of $7.3 billion, versus expectations of $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in revenue during the same quarter last year.\nIntel\u2019s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, saw revenue of $4.35 billion. Wall Street was looking for $4.4 billion. The division saw revenue of $4.7 billion in Q3 2023.\nIntel is dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nIntel also had some good news in the quarter. In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success.\nIntel\u2019s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel\u2019s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short.\nIntel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that\u2019s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there\u2019s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they fell slightly in Q3, according to Gartner.\nThe company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel\u2019s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years.\nStory Continues\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, on Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIt\u2019s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company\u2019s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before.\nQualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance.\nIntel\u2019s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company\u2019s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Revenue for the quarter came in at $158.9bn, topping estimates of $157.3bn and marking an 11% increase year-on-year.\nWhile the report saw Amazon on sure footing, it also pointed to a huge increase in capital expenditures on data centres and networking equipment associated with AI. Amazon is set to spend $75bn this year, and more in 2025, in its bid to be dominant in AI.\nIn its report it touted the expansion of Rufus, its generative AI shopping assistant, which is serving several new countries.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\nMicrosoft stock staged a small recovery on Friday in premarket trade, having lost 6% on Thursday after its earnings report.\nThe report indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (AI chips, or graphics processing units) from \u201cthird parties\u201d weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter.\nMicrosoft primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in data centres to power its AI software.\n\u201cMicrosoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can\u2019t get data centres up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,\u201d D.A.

Plans to invest even more.\nThe capital expenditures of the four largest internet and software companies \u2014 Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. \u2014 are set to total well over $200 billion this year, a record sum for the profligate collective. Executives from each company warned investors this week that their splurge will continue next year, or even ramp up.\nThe spree underscores the extreme costs and resources consumed from the worldwide boom in AI ignited by the arrival of ChatGPT. Tech giants are racing to secure the scarce high-end chips and build the sprawling data centers the technology demands. To do so, the companies have cut deals with energy providers to power these facilities, even reviving a notorious nuclear plant.\nThey\u2019re each trying to convince Wall Street that these huge investments will make their future businesses more profitable than the current ones selling digital ads, goods and software.\nOn an investor call on Thursday, Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, called AI a \u201creally unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,\u201d evidenced by his company\u2019s projection for a record $75 billion in spending for 2024. \u201cI think our customers, the business, and our shareholders will feel good about this long term \u2014 that we\u2019re aggressively pursuing it.\u201d Analysts at MoffettNathanson called Amazon\u2019s spending \u201ctruly staggering.\u201d\nA day earlier, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to ramp up investing in AI language models and other futuristic projects he now frames as core to his company\u2019s future. Meta\u2019s capital spending may climb as high as $40 billion this year. Meanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s capex budget came in higher than Wall Street expectations, and its Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi projected \u201csubstantial\u201d increases in 2025.\nApple Inc. has also vowed to invest in AI, introducing a suite of services, like a more capable Siri, called Apple Intelligence. But its relatively weak financial results this quarter weren\u2019t helped by its new AI products, which mostly hadn\u2019t arrived.\nStory Continues\nFinancial results for the tech giants this week were a mixed bag. Shares of Amazon and Google parent Alphabet soared after the companies beat earnings expectations, largely on the strength of growth in their cloud-computing units. But Meta and Microsoft fell after the former\u2019s spending plans caused jitters, and the latter\u2019s outlook for cloud revenue growth disappointed.\nAlphabet, Microsoft and Meta were all up slightly in premarket trading on Friday, while Amazon rose 6.7% before New York exchanges opened. Apple declined in early trading by about 1.1%.\nFor Microsoft, its lackluster quarterly performance came not because customers weren\u2019t lining up to pay for its cloud and AI offerings but because the company couldn\u2019t build capacity quickly enough. \u201cThis demand all showed up pretty fast,\u201d CEO Satya Nadella told investors in a call on Wednesday. Data centers, he added, \u201cdon\u2019t get built overnight.\u201d\nMicrosoft spent $14.9 billion in the quarter, a 50% rise from last year \u2014 and an amount higher than the company had ever spent on property and equipment in a single year before 2020. CFO Amy Hood told investors Microsoft will work to put its data center supply issue in a \u201cmore balanced position.\u201d\nAnalysts were broadly optimistic that Microsoft\u2019s data center supply difficulties will eventually be straightened out. The issue will \u201cmodestly\u201d restrict Microsoft\u2019s cloud business, but the company\u2019s investments, particularly its large stake in OpenAI, are \u201cplanting the longer-term seeds for success,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note after the company\u2019s results.\nWall Street\u2019s concern with runaway spending isn\u2019t going away. This week Meta reported $4.4 billion in operating losses for Reality Labs, its division that makes augmented reality glasses and other gadgets far from commercial success. The company has also spent heavily to make its Llama models that aim to compete with Google and OpenAI.\nOn the Meta earnings call, Zuckerberg argued that these AI investments are improving the company\u2019s primary business of selling ads on Facebook and Instagram. But investors will remain nervous about any signs of weakness in the ads business \u201cas they continue to wait for a return on Meta\u2019s bigger AI bets,\u201d said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst for Emarketer.\nStill, Meta\u2019s stock is up 60% this year. And some analysts said Zuckerberg\u2019s big spending will pay off down the line. \u201cOf course, history is on his side,\u201d MoffettNathanson wrote in their report, \u201cand investors now have been trained that patience here is a virtue.\u201d\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Henry Ren.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nTrump\u2019s Immigration Policy Would Make Food Inflation Even Worse\nHow to End the Backlog of Asylum Cases?

This excludes a charge of $0.06 per share related to the disallowance of certain 2016 capital expenditures under the qualifying infrastructure plant rider in Illinois.\nWith this solid quarter, we remain on track for a strong 2024. Our focus on executing the fundamentals of our business is creating real value for our customers and stockholders. Today, we're reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year on an adjusted basis. The range is $4.80 to $4.90 a share. Of course, this assumes normal weather to the remainder of 2024.\nWe continue to see strong foundation of growth in the region. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 2.9%, continuing a long running trend below the national average. Microsoft is making good progress on its large data center complex in Southeast Wisconsin. The company has continued to increase its land holdings as part of this development. It has been reported that Microsoft now owns more than 1,900 acres up from 1,300 acres at the beginning of the year and work is well underway.\nWe're seeing development elsewhere in the state as well. Amazon, for example, opened a 1.1 million-square-foot warehouse in Kenosha earlier this year. The company is growing steadily with additional distribution facilities and is also starting to use electric delivery vans in its fleet.\nAnd in Green Bay, Georgia Pacific completed a major mill expansion just last month with an investment of $550 million. Of course, this growth is spawning small commercial and residential development throughout the region. This highlights the strength and the potential of our local economy and underscores the need for the investments in our updated capital plan.\nAnd speaking of capital plan, we're very excited to roll out the plan for the period 2025 to 2029. As you may have seen from our announcement this morning, we expect to invest $28 billion over the next five years. This is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $4.3 billion above our previous five-year plan. That's more than an 18% increase. Once again, a major factor in our plan is the economic growth we're seeing in southeastern Wisconsin, particularly in what we call the I-94 Corridor between Milwaukee and the Illinois State line. This plan supports 800 megawatts of additional demand over the next five years as an incremental 400 megawatts from our previous plan.\nIn our new five-year plan, we expect our asset-based growth to an average rate of 8.8% a year. This supports our long-term projected earnings per share growth of 6.5% to 7% a year on a compound annual basis. As I mentioned, we increased our capital plan by $4.3 billion, driven by an increase in regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution, and partially offset by a reduction in energy infrastructure.\nLet me give you a few updates on the details. Over the next five years, we'll continue to transform our power generation fleet to support economic growth, reliability, and compliance with EPA rules by investing in renewables and natural gas generation. Between 2025 and 2029, we plan to increase our investment in regulated renewals by $2.1 billion over our prior plan.\nIn total, we plan to invest $9.1 billion in 2,900 megawatts of solar, 900 megawatts of wind, and almost 600 megawatts of battery storage; that adds up to 4,400 megawatts; more than quadrupling our carbon free generation from where we are today. These resources save on fuel costs and provide benefits to customers through tax credits.\nTo support economic growth and system reliability when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine and on those extreme weather days, we need dispatchable resources. We expect to spend an incremental $900 million on modern, efficient, natural gas generation over the next five years versus the prior plan. This includes both combustion turbines and reciprocating internal combustion engines or RICE units.\nAlso, we plan to invest an additional $400 million in liquified natural gas capacity for another 2-Bcf facility. This will be used to meet customer demand for heating and ensure gas supply for power generation. In addition, American Transmission Company will be adding transmission capabilities to serve the region's robust economic growth, connecting new renewables, and strengthening the system.\nOur plan calls for us to invest $3.2 billion in that effort between 2025 and 2029. This represents a $200-million increase from the previous plan. And to help ensure reliability and support economic growth, we're continuing to invest in our distribution networks with an additional $700 million in the plan. Given the significant investment opportunity in our regulated businesses, we have reduced our planned investments in our infrastructure segment by $800 million compared to the last plan. This leaves us approximately $400 million in the plan for next year. And today, I'm pleased to announce our plan to acquire a 90% interest in Hardin Solar III energy park located in Ohio.\nWe expect to invest approximately $410 million to add 250 megawatts of renewable energy to our infrastructure portfolio when the projects come online, currently expected in the first quarter of 2025. Our future is bright, investment opportunity has never been stronger, and we're focused on execution. We look forward to providing more detail on our plan in just a few weeks at the EEI Conference.\nTurning to the regulatory front, I have a few updates across our service areas. In Wisconsin, rate reviews are nearly complete for test years 2025 and 2026. All testimony and hearings are concluded in the case and we expect a decision by the end of the year with new rates effective January 1, 2025.\nAs in Michigan, the Public Service Commission has now approved the settlement in the 2025 rate cases for both Michigan Gas Utilities and Upper Michigan energy resources, each with an ROE of 9.86%. And in Illinois, we're actively engaged in two dockets. One is the review of the safety modernization program. The next steps are an ELG proposed order at the end of November, final briefings to the ICC in December, and the commission's final decision expected in the first quarter of 2025.\nThe other docket is an evaluation of the future of natural gas in Illinois, which was initially planned to conclude next year. The ICC has extended this docket into 2026. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments.\nNow, I'll turn to Xia to provide you with more details on our financial results and our financing plans.\nStory Continues\nXia Liu\nThank you, Scott.\nTurning now to earnings. Our third-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings were $0.82 per share. This excludes the $0.06 per share charge related to the disallowance of certain 2016 capital expenditures under the QIP rider in Illinois.\nWhile this was a decrease of $0.18 per share quarter over quarter, we did exceed our Q3 guidance range driven by more favorable September weather, financing, and timing of tax items compared to the guidance. As Scott indicated, we remain on track to meet our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance.\nNow let's look at our quarter-over-quarter variances. Our earnings package includes a comparison of adjusted third-quarter results on page 16. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2024 were $0.18 lower when compared to 2023. This decrease was driven by the Illinois rate design change, higher O&M, depreciation and amortization, and interest expense. These items more than offset favorable weather, timing of fuel expense, taxes, and other items.\nSpecifically on weather, compared to normal conditions, we estimate that weather had a $0.02 positive impact in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a $0.01 positive impact in 2023. Also, as I reminded you on the last few calls, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas, base revenues are now more concentrated in the first and fourth quarters when natural gas usage is the highest. This shift resulted in lower third-quarter earnings when compared to the prior year.\nBefore I turn to earnings at the other segments, let me briefly discuss our weather normal electric sales for the quarter. Retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine were up [four-tenth of 1%] quarter over quarter. Sales from residential and small C&I segments both slightly increased compared to Q3 last year. Overall year to date retail electric volumes are in line with our forecast.\nLooking at ATC, continued capital investment contributed an incremental [penny] to Q3 earnings compared to 2023. Remember, we have been recognizing earnings at 10.38% ROE. I'll discuss in a few minutes that we have some tailwind in Q4 related to FERC's recent decision of 10.48% ROE.\nAnd in our energy infrastructure segment, earnings improved $0.06 in the third quarter of '24 compared to the third quarter of 2023. This was primarily driven by production tax credits resulting from higher PTC rates approved by the IRS in the third quarter as well as a quarter-over-quarter increase in production from our renewable generation facilities.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segments decreased $0.07 as a result of the impact of tax timing and higher interest expense. As Scott noted, we are reaffirming our 2024 annual guidance on an adjusted basis. That range is $4.80 to 4 $4.90 per share. This includes October weather and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Year to date compared to last year, we're $0.07 behind largely due to weather. However, looking ahead, we have some tailwinds in Q4 this year. This will help us to achieve our adjusted earnings guidance.\nFor example, as I mentioned just now, we have been recognizing earnings at ATC, assuming a 10.38% ROE. With FERC's decision on the 10.48%, we will be able to unwind a reserve at ATC in Q4 to reflect this change. This item is about $0.05 per share that we have included in our guidance. And recall, weather was $0.07 unfavorable in Q4 last year. Assuming normal weather for the remainder of this year, it also should be a tailwind. Overall, we remain on track to meet our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance.\nNow, turning to our financing plan. For 2024, we continue to utilize dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans to issue common equity. Also, we have now formally put in place an ATM program which we plan to tap into during this quarter. Overall, we still project that our common equity issuance will be up to $200 million for 2024.\nBeyond 2024, Scott has outlined our new five-year capital plan. I'll spend a few minutes discussing our anticipated financing plan. You can find this information on page 22 of the earnings package. As you can see on the chart, over the next five years, we expect cash from operations to fund $18.5 billion to $19.5 billion or about 60% of our cash needs. About $9.5 billion to $10 billion or 31% of the funding is expected to come from incremental debt. This could include some junior subordinated notes or other instruments with equity content. And the remaining 9% of cash is expected to be funded by common equity. This range is between $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.\nAs I said previously, the cadence of common equity is a function of capital. Given the strong capital plan in 2025, we expect common equity to be between $700 million to $800 million. All in all compared to the prior five-year plan, we expect about 50% of the $4.3 billion additional capital to be financed with increased equity content.\nFinally, as shown on page 21 of the earnings package, through our capital allocation, we expect the percent of asset base in our regulated electric businesses to grow faster over the next five years. This is driven by the strong economic development and demand growth in Wisconsin and our continued energy transition plans.\nAt the same time, the percent of asset base in gas distribution and contracted renewable is expected to decline. Particularly, you can see that we expect our asset base in Illinois to decline from 16% in 2023 to 10% in 2029 with only 9% at Peoples Gas.\nIn closing, we're excited about our company's future and the investment opportunities ahead of us. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott.\nScott Lauber\nThank you, Xia.\nFinally, a quick reminder about the dividend. I expect we'll provide our 2025 dividend plan and earnings guidance in December. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're positioned well within the range, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth of the earnings per share. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.\nOperator, we're now ready for the question-and-answer of the call.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nShahriar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza\nScott, let me just -- I know this is a repeated question for me, but I have to ask just given the size in your resource mix. I wanted to just touch on Point Beach for a sec. I mean, obviously many of the infrastructure segment PPAs will walk around the time at the Point Beach PPA. Are those viable alternatives? If you can't get there with NextEra, would you look to backstop them with dispatchable capacity? So some incremental spend there. Just directionally, how is that bid as progressing?\nScott Lauber\nSure. And it's just a reminder for everyone. Our PPA with Point Beach ends -- I think the one contract ends in December of 2030, the other is March of 2033. And like we talked about; we have been a very constructive discussions on the Point Beach with NextEra. We're making good progress on both sides. We've been really busy up here with Wisconsin rate case. I think they've been busy down there with some hurricane activity. So we're making good progress more to come. I expect you'll see more in the next six months. But lining up really well, we think, for everybody.\nShahriar Pourreza\nOkay. That's helpful.\nAnd then obviously, Scott, very healthy CapEx update. I'm not getting a strong sense on why we saw that CapEx reduction on the infrastructure side. I think it's been some time, there's been some deemphasis of that segment. I just want to get a better sense of what's driving. Is it a capital allocation return issue. Is the demand for contract of renewables slowed? I guess what exactly is going on in that segment. Should we start tempering our expectations there?\nScott Lauber\nNo, I mean, what we looked at it last year when we went through the plan, we had actually reduced that segment also just because the amount of economic development. And then as what happened in Illinois and we reduced our capital plan there, we said we were going to spend about $800 million incremental. And the last contract we announced here hits all our investment profiles and it fills that amount of the $800 million we said we're going to do. We just have a lot of capital within the regulated utility with the economic development going on in Wisconsin. And we just want to concentrate on that. The economics have been good on the other -- in the infrastructure segment. It's just, we've got a lot to deploy here in Wisconsin, so we're going to concentrate on that.\nShahriar Pourreza\nOkay. That is perfect. Thanks guys. We'll see you in a week in Florida and congrats on getting Warner. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith, Jefferies.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\nJust talking about Illinois a little bit more here on PGL here, few different options that have been put on the table here and there's a staff rack out there. And how do you think about that option three? I was about $7 billion-ish to [2040]. How does that compare with what you guys are updating here today? And is there any upside vis-\u00e0-vis what you guys are embedding against that proposed outcome here?\nI'll let you guys comment (multiple speakers)--\nScott Lauber\nSure. That's a good question, and option three just to get everyone on the same page. Option three has the spending and it's the option below a spending option, it's the preferred option by PGL. And then staff also came out, ICC staff came out and recommended option three also that has about $7.2 billion of spending over the period.\nWhen you look at what we put together in the five-year plan. And Xian and I don't like to have much any white space if any in our five-year plan, so we took the capital down just to the emergency work and the work needed for facility relocates. So that's about $90 million a year in our plan for the next five years. So if this plan would get picked up, I think that could be an upside of maybe $100 million to $150 million, maybe $200 million a year. But remember if they would pick that, we ramp down those projects very quickly of what we're doing. So it take a while to ramp back up. But we took basically just the bare minimum and put in our current five-year plan, so there would be upside if one of these options is selected.\nDid that answer your question?\nOperator\nMichael Sullivan, Wolfe research.\nMichael Sullivan\nScott, maybe I just wanted to ask for a little more color on the Wisconsin case that you have pending and maybe why you weren't able to settle there, what some of the sticking points might be and how you're feeling about the final order coming up.\nScott Lauber\nSure. So we are extremely far in the Wisconsin case. When you think about the Wisconsin case, we've gone through all the hearings. In fact, the final decision matrix just came out the other day. So we're about as far along in the Wisconsin case we've ever been this time of the year. So right now, the next step is the commission making a decision which they usually do. Historically, it's been the first week in December -- the first or second week in December, but they're far along and they've got everything ready for a decision.\nNow, the idea of a settlement -- and we talked a little bit about settlement. We're very happy where the staff position came out. I think everyone still related to two years ago on the settlement that we had in Wisconsin, I think everyone wants to just see the commission go through a case. I'm very comfortable with the commission going through a case and deciding going through the decision matrix.\nSo we just weren't able to come up to a settlement, but I'm not concerned about that. I think overall, our commission is filled with really balanced individuals that understand the importance of reliability and the economic development in the region. So we're ready for a decision. We just couldn't get there in the settlement, but that's not all bad either. I think everyone wants to see what's going on here.\nDid that answer your question.\nMichael Sullivan\nYeah, it does. Yeah, very helpful, Scott.\nAnd then I just had two questions just on the earning side. On this ATC ROE that you're going to book in Q4, I guess how should we think about why you are not raising guidance for that or what would have happened if you didn't -- weren't able to book that?\nScott Lauber\nNo, that's a good question and things move around in their forecast. And it came through there. We just got a little bit of timing and some other expenses that we anticipate maybe would come through a little bit better, but timing, we got to make sure we execute on it. So factoring it all in and we went through and factored everything through here and comfortable with keeping the guidance where it's at.\nMichael Sullivan\nOkay. And then the last one (multiple speakers)--\nXia Liu\nMichael, this is Xia.\nJust remember, we had a really mild first quarter. Year to date, we're $0.06 behind our weather. So like Scott said, there are lots of things that have developed throughout the year and this $0.05 will help us offset some of the weather deficit.\nMichael Sullivan\nOkay, appreciate that color.\nAnd then the last one for me just to level set ahead of December here. So can you just remind what the base is for your long-term EPS CAGR? And will that shift with the December update? And how do we think about the potential to get back in that 6.5% to 7% range after being short of that this year based on your guide?\nScott Lauber\nSure. And our 6.5% to 7% and we are still using the 2023 base. I think it was $4.60 as our starting point for our guidance because last year because of the Illinois decision and some adjustments we had to do there and timing of when we could do our capital investments, so we're keeping that 2023 base this year. As we look at our long-term guidance, we will -- we got to get through the rate case here and we'll come out with our plan next -- in December after we get through that.\nOperator\nNeil Kalton, Wells Fargo Securities.\nNeil Kalton\nSo quick question, Scott, you opened up talking about the Microsoft that they acquired more land. I think you said 1,900 acres. Is that correct in total?\nScott Lauber\nCorrect. So at the beginning of the year, they started about 1,300, and now they're up to 1,900 acres.\nNeil Kalton\nOkay, perfect.\nAnd then in terms of the CapEx refresh, I know you're waiting on Microsoft to lay out additional plans what they intend to do? Was there anything in this CapEx revision that incorporated potential spend for what they might do like to some extent or is that still all to be determined all on the [come]?\nScott Lauber\nSo what this has been and what we talked about is 1,800 megawatts of capacity for the region over this five-year period, which includes Microsoft, which includes getting some demand in from some electric vehicles, and all the other economic development in the region. So that's 1,800 megawatts. Just to put that in perspective, our system is about 7,500 megawatts. So it's a little over 20% growth in capacity or demand needs in the region.\nSo all of that is factored into our five-year plan. But just like many other companies, we are getting inquiries from a variety of other data centers. We just don't come out with a number until we really feel comfortable that it's actually going to happen. But if there would be any upside from any future stuff, that would probably be in those outer half of the plan. But based on the conversations, there's just a lot of good discussion on continued economic development in the region.\nNeil Kalton\nOkay. Got it.\nAnd then, I mean, so just -- and maybe there's only [limited to what as to] what you can say. But like if Microsoft were to formally announce a phase two, would that be something that would necessitate more capacity?\nScott Lauber\nThat would have to see what they're -- I mean, Microsoft is -- we'll let Microsoft make their announcements. Working with them on the demand, I'm not sure if that actually includes some other phases or not. They just -- we work with them on the demand over the period, and keep it inside baseball here, unfortunately, but that's the way they want to do it, which is fine.\nOperator\nAndrew Weisel, Scotia Bank.\nAndrew Weisel\nWant to clarify a little on the CapEx update. Obviously, some very big numbers here and I appreciate the granular detail on the moving pieces. One, I wanted to clarify was electric generation. You'd showed that the total on page 18 went up by $3.7 billion but the commentary on page 17 really only calls out $3 billion. You show the regulated renewables and the natural gas generation. We're missing about $700 million. So what else is in that bucket?\nAnd then it looks like (multiple speakers) about a $100 million increase for natural gas distribution. Would I be correct is that just higher day-to-day spending and cost inflation? Or have you made some assumptions around regulation and policy changes in Illinois compared to the assumptions you made when you gave the last update in February?\nScott Lauber\nYeah, good questions. Really quick analysis of the numbers.\nSo when you look at the gas distribution and you go behind the numbers, it's actually a decrease in Illinois and an increase in the other parts of the service territory Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota as it relates to adding capital for good customer growth and just other area expansion.\nI think as you look at the FIMSA rules, there could be some requirements that more capital is needed until we see the final FIMSA rules. It's hard to really handicap the final number. So that's really a plus in the other areas a little declined in Illinois.\nAnd in the generation, you're exactly right. There's probably about another $700 million, that's in a variety of projects across the enterprise from looking at upgrading a wind farm to get some additional power -- production tax credits, to adding some more resilience and a few of our generating plants to looking at other different types of backup storage just to make sure we have that additional resilience. So it's a variety of items all in that generation area just so we can make sure we continue to hit that demand.\nAndrew Weisel\nOkay, great. That's very helpful.\nThen on the transmission side, you increased it by $200 million. Is that all related to near-term economic development? Would I be correct in assuming that the MISO tranche 2 stuff is more outside of the forecast period?\nScott Lauber\nYeah, you're exactly right.\nMore of the MISO tranche 2 is going to be after this -- most likely after this five-year plan. Maybe a little bit at the very end, but most of it's going to be after the five-year plan, but we'll know more of that in the final numbers come December.\nAndrew Weisel\nVery good.\nAnd one last one here on the load growth, I think you said you're now expecting 1,800 megawatts of incremental load that's up from 1,400 megawatts. I don't think you commented on what that means in terms of percentage load growth forecast. Is that something that you can share now or is that something you plan to share at EEI.\nScott Lauber\nSure, we can talk about it now.\nSo when it looks at a megawatt-hour basis and I think these are probably on the low side, but we extended that 4.5% to 5% electric sales growth through 2029, so we continue to see the volumes on a megawatt-hour basis and on a megawatt basis, we are at -- up 1,800 on a base of about 7,500. So that's a little over a 20% increase in the demand on our sales. It's a very, very significant demand increase. And I really look at the demand as being a key component because that's really where we have to build the dispatchable resources too to make sure we have enough demand and capacity hit on those peak days.\nDid that makes sense?\nAndrew Weisel\nYeah. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nSophie Karp, KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSophie Karp\nSo it's a great update all around, right? Your load growth is going higher. Very, very healthy capital update as well. Wisconsin rate case is in its going to last innings already. Is there any reason why I guess you wouldn't raise the EPS growth rate when you do refresh your guidance in December? Like are there any like offsetting factors we are missing here that would prevent that from happening?\nScott Lauber\nThat's a good question.\nAnd when we looked at it we did -- we added capital in Wisconsin, we also reduced it in the WEC infrastructure, but also looked at Illinois and reducing it. So as we look at it and add in the equity needs and the debt needs, we're very comfortable with that 6.5% to 7%. We do have to get through the Wisconsin rate case and really hear what goes on in our safety modernization program in Illinois, which we'll hear in the first quarter of next year. But it's really just being realistic on the financing plans associated with our capital spending and taking down capital in some of the other areas.\nOperator\nDurgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra\nI got some Haribo Gummy Bears sitting outside my front door. That's my trick or treat.\nScott Lauber\nExcellent. Thank you for supporting the community.\nDurgesh Chopra\nThere you go. And they are from -- sourced from Milwaukee. Okay. (laughter) So fantastic.\nSo couple of questions. Xia, just -- I know you talked about 50% of the capital funded through equity but when I compare plan, the prior plan over the current plan, the CapEx has gone up $4.3 billion, but the equity has only gone up roughly $1 billion. It's gone up from like $2 billion and change to $3 billion at the midpoint of the current guidance range. So maybe just why is it -- I would have thought that the equity is a lot higher. Maybe just help us bridge the two plan equity issuances between the two plans, please.\nXia Liu\nYeah, I'd be happy to.\nSo the last plan, remember, the range was $1.95 billion to $2.35 billion. This plan, the range is $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. So to your point is roughly about $800-million increase in common equity. We also are adding some holding company that particularly are using maybe some hybrid that would give us 50% of the equity content. So if you include that, plus the $800 million of common equity, that's the around $2-billion increase in equity content. So our capital has gone up $4.3 billion. We're adding a little over $2 billion of equity content, including the $800 million of common equity.\nDurgesh Chopra\nGot it. As always, that is crystal clear. Thank you, Xia.\nAnd then maybe just quickly wanted to follow up on Delilah Solar. Is the plan that's still that it -- it completed construction and goes into service by the end of the year. Is that still on track?\nScott Lauber\nYes, that is correct. Delilah, Maple Flats are both on track by the end of the year.\nOperator\nJeremy Tonet, JP Morgan.\nJeremy Tonet\nJust wanted to go into the addition of gas generation and how that contributes to LNG operations overall. If you have any thoughts, you could share there.\nScott Lauber\nSure. And we're adding more gas generation and as you can imagine, we want to make sure that we have that -- it's a bit dispatchable gas -- our own gas within the state of Wisconsin to make sure we can run the generation and keep the houses warm on the gas side. So we added another 2 Bcf in our plan. Literally, the one that we're looking at and we filed that the commission is sitting where a coal pile used to sit. So having that stored energy or stored fuel in the state of Wisconsin near the power plants are very helpful to make sure on those coldest days of the year that we have enough energy in the state to be able to run those plants.\nA couple years ago, we had a -- one of our pipelines, not our pipeline, but one of our vendors suppliers' pipeline had a compressor issue that really made the state of Wisconsin really thin on natural gas. So having those LNG tanks are going to be very critical to keep that reliability.\nJeremy Tonet\nGot it. Very helpful there.\nAnd then going a bit further here with -- there's a big call on generation broadly in the country and just wondering if you could provide us thoughts on reserve margins how it stands now where it could be going. And as it relates to gas generation, coal generation -- coal in particular, does it affect retirement timelines given this greater need? And at the same time, could CCS be part of the answer here? Just wondering if you have thoughts on these topics.\nScott Lauber\nSure. And gas generation is critical for us as we look at having something dispatchable. I mean, today the wind is blowing but some days the wind doesn't blow or the sun isn't shining. So we are looking at building our generation, the mix renewables, and gas generation and just to make sure we're staying ahead of the reserve margin that's needed for (inaudible) and they've continued to evolve their rules as more renewables appropriately as more renewables get on the system to make sure they have seasonal demand and the load following type of needs here and the capacity. So that is very important for us as we continue to grow out our capacity plans.\nAnd what was your second part?\nJeremy Tonet\nCarbon capture with regards to gas generation and just coal plant retirements in general -- the generation (multiple speakers)--\nScott Lauber\nIn the carbon capture for us, we don't have any natural place to store the carbon here in Wisconsin. And if we had to do carbon capture, we think it would cost our customers $1 billion to $2 billion more in order to do carbon capture and to haul it someplace that you look at where you're going to store it and then you have the transmission of it. So we of course, looked at it. Is it possible? It just did not seem viable and cost effective for our customers versus the plan that we're developing here and we laid out in front of you.\nAnd when you think about the coal retirements, we already retired Oak Creek 5 and 6. The other units 7 and 8, we plan to retire at the end of 2025. And we're doing that because we're putting in some of the more efficient gas generation. And to be quite honest, if we weren't going to retire 7 and 8, we'd have to add additional capital to those plants to have them extend longer and add the carbon capture.\nSo those are still planning being retirement. Some of the plants like Western 3, we plan on retiring by 2031. We all -- we continue to look; does it make sense to use natural gas there? Some other fuel. I don't know if it'd be economical or not, but it really hasn't adjusted much of our coal adjustments either -- our coal fine retirements.\nJeremy Tonet\nGot it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that.\nAnd just one last quick one, if I could as far as '25 funding needs are concerned for equity content. Just wondering, is it makes sense for the ATM? Could we see a block? How much transferability, I guess, is in the mix here?\nScott Lauber\nSure. I'll let Xia take that one.\nXia Liu\nYeah, so we have -- remember we still have the employee benefit plans on, so that will be part of the equity rate for next year. So the ATM should handle the remaining piece fairly easily. So we don't plan to have a block sale right now.\nThe tax credits are already included in the FFO. So on average, we've been selling $100 million to $200 million so far. And as we continue to add renewable projects, that number could grow a little bit, but those are already assumed in the FFO.\nOperator\nNicholas Campanella, Barclays.\nNicholas Campanella\nSo just one for me, a lot of things have been answered, I guess just decomposing that 8.8% asset based growth figure, it does seem like a lot of the growth is coming from Wisconsin. So just what's rate-based growth outlook in Wisconsin as you see it today versus what you've been trending at or executing at the past few years?\nAnd that's it for me. Thanks.\nScott Lauber\nSo when you look at the 8 -- the rate base go through Wisconsin, it's got to be, oh, I don't know. I imagine between 14% and 15% pretty significant rate-based growth. But remember that's where all the economic growth is.\nAnd when you look at the economic growth and we usually look at the growth and try to break it into different components being whether it's growth from sales, growth from resiliency, and a lot of our growth. I would say, I don't know, $8 billion to $9 billion that is related to economic development and growth of the support of the economy.\nSo it's really driven that that sales are going to help grow into that, so that's significant. And then ATC has good growth. So we're also growing a lot in the American Transmission company which is Wisconsin-based also the FERC regulated. So a lot of growth in Wisconsin largely driven by economic development.\nXia Liu\nYeah, Nick, 40% of our -- for -- this is Xia. 40% of our total capital is we call the growth capital. So that comes with the large customers paying for their required demands and the related cost. So we feel good about the growth in Wisconsin and also the driver for it.\nOperator\nPaul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson\nJust to follow things up. Is there any change -- well, first of all, could you just remind me what your -- what the rate increase outlook is given the new CapEx program if it's changed at all and just what it is again.\nScott Lauber\nSure. And we're right now going through the rate case in Wisconsin. So if you go out and you're starting to look at '27 to 2030, you got to break it into this capital, as Xia said a lot of it's being supported by economic development. So I think rate increases will be in line with inflation. We do have some reliability projects that we're putting in place that we're doing some overhead to underground, to add more stability as we continue to see some stronger weather patterns and wind patterns across the state. So that may take it up maybe 1% above inflation. But for the most part, a lot of this capital is being driven by economic development, which will come with megawatt hours and megawatt sales.\nSo it's not like it's all on the back of our retail customers at any needs. And Microsoft has said, and they put in their testimony, they understand and they need to pay their fair share. They don't plan on subsidizing anyone else, but they also realize that they're not supposed to get subsidized either. So they have been perfect. And as we look at potentially other data centers coming in, that's the playbook to make sure everyone pays their fair share appropriate amount.\nPaul Patterson\nAnd then on the -- I apologize if I missed this but, but it looked like there was a big increase in gas normalized sales in commercial or something for Q3 when I looked at your (multiple speakers)--\nScott Lauber\nYeah, and we can -- when you look at Q3, commercial industrial. Yeah, it was up a little bit. Q3 is such a small volume quarter that any little change can affect it. So I would not read much into it. I would look more at the year to date where we are. Q3 that could have been just an anomaly with the meter issue is something that I mean there's so small of volumes in that quarter. You got to really look at the year to date.\nAll right, thanks, everyone. That concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for participating. If you have any more questions, please feel free to contact Beth Straka at (414) 221-4639.\nOperator\nCall has now ended. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in CrowdStrike Holdings implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\nInsiders have been selling lately\nEvery investor in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CrowdStrike Holdings.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CrowdStrike Holdings?\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nWe can see that CrowdStrike Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of CrowdStrike Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in CrowdStrike Holdings. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.6%. With 7.5% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO George Kurtz is the owner of 3.1% of the company's shares.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nStory Continues\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.. Insiders own US$3.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over CrowdStrike Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with CrowdStrike Holdings .\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

He said that firms depend heavily on big technology companies for computing power and the ability to deal with large data sets related to AI. If these major operators experience glitches, catastrophic results could radiate outward.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

He added that a lot of time and effort would be freed up when there is a set of regulator-approved control standards for the industry.\nYue said banks are required to conduct risk assessments of AI service providers to strengthen their operational resilience and must have in place contingency plans to address potential service disruptions caused by third parties.\nStory Continues\nThese \"basic, common sense\" moves are essential to better safeguard companies and other institutions, said James Elwes, HSBC's chief information officer for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"[Third-party risk management] starts with simply identifying where your concentration risk is and documenting that,\" he said. \"If you've not done that, you're not going to do any of the next steps that are important.\"\nVendor diversification could help to solve some issues, Elwes said, but he added that big tech companies are often the most well-equipped to be third-party service providers.\n\"There are benefits to concentration simply because of the nature of some of these organisations - the scale they can provide and the investment they can put in,\" he said.\n\"So a degree of concentration on vendors, especially within technology, is likely to remain.\"\nSarah Breeden, deputy governor at the Bank of England, said in a pre-recorded speech that financial institutions are expected to have a \"stronger and more rigorous\" grasp of AI as they increase their dependence on it for \"higher impact areas of their businesses.\" These areas include credit risk assessment, capital management and algorithmic trading.\nHong Kong's government unveiled its first guidelines on the responsible use of AI on Monday.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks on the list of crowded software short positions.\nWith the close of 2024 approaching fast, artificial intelligence continues to set the narrative on Wall Street. The tail end of October marks the start of another highly anticipated earnings season, which for the most part, will continue to be dominated by AI. On the hardware front, investors will be on the lookout for whether the demand for AI GPUs is sustaining and if the firm that is the market leader is also improving its margins and profitability. For software stocks, investors will pour over profitability data to determine whether the billions of dollars invested in training and testing AI as well as in business partnerships are yielding results.\nFor software stocks, their exposure to AI is so strong that it has divided the 2024 stock performance of some firms into neat halves determined by investor sentiment about their AI products. One such AI software stock ranked 5th on our recent list of AI stocks that insiders are selling. Looking at its year-to-date share price performance, it\u2019s rather neatly divided into two halves that converge on June 13th. Year to date on June 13th, the shares were down 19.8% even though the firm\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenue was a cool $19.4 billion and had grown by 10% annually. Before that eventful day, the firm\u2019s first quarter had seen it grow revenue by 11% annually but struggle to keep costs low and profit margins high.\nYet, the investor bearishness surrounding this well-known provider of productivity software tools such as Photoshop and Reader, would change in the blink of an eye. From June 13th to the third week of October, the shares have reversed course and gained 8.5%. In fact, between the 13th and September 12th, the stock had gained 27.9%. June 13th was the day that this firm reported its second-quarter earnings. The results led to its shares jumping by 13% in aftermarket trading, with investors impressed by the fact that the firm increased full-year guidance to range between $21.40 billion and $21.50 billion from an earlier $21.30 billion $21.50 billion.\nThe optimism was driven in part by the firm\u2019s Creative Cloud business which includes products such as Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, and Express. The AI addition to Creative Cloud was the firm\u2019s set of generative AI models dubbed Firefly. Management shared that Firefly was at the heart of the ARR guidance bump to $1.95 billion as they shared:\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the Digital Media business and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services and Express. We\u2019re pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half.\u201d\nWith AI profitability driving the second-quarter earnings season, investors were naturally ecstatic and sent the stock higher.\nHowever, the June respite would be short-lived as the shares tanked by 13.4% in September. As usual, AI was the culprit. The downward trend started in the form of a 9.2% drop in after-market following the firm\u2019s third-quarter report. It saw the company guide Q4 revenue at a midpoint of $5.525 billion which fell below the $5.61 billion analyst consensus.\nWhile this firm is a consumer and professional software stock, the broader software as a service (SaaS) industry hasn\u2019t been spared by the AI-driven Wall Street trends either. SaaS and software stocks are predominantly valued through two metrics: the Rule of 40 and EV/Sales (or variants such as EV/EBITDA or Price to Sales). These multiples are somewhat unique to the software and SaaS stock narrative as they evaluate the firms based on their ability to grow. This is key since one of the main reasons behind SaaS stock popularity is that they do not have to deal with inventory, logistics, or supply chain issues like other businesses.\nIn the AI era, SaaS valuation multiples and revenue growth estimates have been severely compressed. Data shows that the median price to forward sales SaaS multiple is 5.5x right now. The valuations are driven by lower growth expectations. After AI and the decimation ushered in by high interest rates, just 1% of SaaS and software companies have a 12-month future revenue growth rate higher than 30% as of June 2024. Digging deeper, investors have also placed a higher premium on growth as while firms with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 have a median EV/Sales multiple of 8.9x, those with a growth rate greater than 30% but a Rule of 40 score lesser than 40 have a median multiple of 11.6x.\nThese AI-driven software shifts, precipitated by worries of a reduction in SaaS demand due to businesses self-developing software using AI have also affected investor sentiment. According to Jefferies\u2019 latest Trading Positioning Survey, 19% of institutional investors were overweight on software stocks as of October 2024, a sharp drop over July\u2019s reading of 28% and January\u2019s 51%. Yet, investors have also tempered their short positions as Jefferies shows that 54 software stocks were shorted as of October compared to 73 in July.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software short positions, we ranked the top nine crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a well-known cybersecurity software provider that rose to fame earlier this year after its faulty software update led to an unbelievable 8.5 million computers going offline worldwide. The outage also flipped the firm\u2019s narrative, as the shares lost more than 42% of their value over the next two weeks. However, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has managed to control some of the damage from the outage as its shares are up 24.9% year to date and 41.6% since the post-outage bottom. Part of the recovery is based on easing investor worries of customer loss as CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) might be able to prevent fallout due to high switching costs. Investors will nevertheless be on the watchout for customers jumping ship, and they will also monitor CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s fiscal 2031 recurring revenue guidance of $10 billion and midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of crowded software shorts according to Jefferies. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $982.26 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25%. The $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +27.5% and +22.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) Rebounds Amid Post-Outage Challenges\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity software products provider that made headlines earlier this year due to a faulty software update that caused one of the biggest software outages in history. The outage affected an unbelievable 8.5 million computers worldwide, and it is now shaping CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s narrative as well. While the shares are up by 42% since the post-outage bottom, compared to the pre-outage peak, they are still down 20.8%. Investors are waiting to see whether the reputational impacts from the outage might lead businesses to not renew their contracts with CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s Falcon system. As for the firm, it is still targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by its fiscal year 2031 and a midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%. Consequently, investors will be combing CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s upcoming earnings with a fine-toothed comb to see if customer sentiment has weakened to make meeting these guidelines difficult.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 9th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.27%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.65%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.26%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the cloud-based security company had gained 5.16% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.21% and the S&P 500's gain of 2% in that time.\nThe upcoming earnings release of CrowdStrike Holdings will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.82, indicating constancy compared to the equivalent quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $982.26 million, reflecting a 24.97% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\nCRWD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

          "whole_article": "By David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said on Monday it sued Delta Air Lines in U.S. District Court in Georgia after a faulty software update prompted a global outage in July.\nThe July 19 incident led to worldwide flight cancellations and hit industries including banks, healthcare, media companies and hotel chains.\nCrowdStrike said it sued to make clear that CrowdStrike did not cause the harm that Delta claims, and that Delta repeatedly refused assistance from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. Delta did not immediately comment on CrowdStrike's suit.\nCrowdStrike is seeking a declaratory judgment plus legal fees.\nDelta's lawsuit filed on Friday in Fulton County Superior Court called the faulty software update from CrowdStrike \"catastrophic\" and said the company \"forced untested and faulty updates to its customers, causing more than 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to crash.\"\nDelta said the faulty update caused 7,000 flight cancellations, disrupted travel plans of 1.3 million customers and cost the carrier more than $500 million.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit, also filed on Friday, said Delta's own response and technology caused delays in the carrier's ability to resume normal operations.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit reiterated its contention that it has minimal liability, something Delta rejected.\nDelta said CrowdStrike is liable for over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses as well as for unspecified lost profits, expenditures - including legal fees - reputational harm and future revenue loss.\nThe incident prompted the U.S. Transportation Department to open an investigation.\n\"If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed,\" Delta's lawsuit says.\nDelta said it has invested billions of dollars in information technology licensing and infrastructure.\nLast month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologized before Congress for the faulty software update.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries.\nAs reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself.

Non-fuel expenses amounted to $170 million, while fuel costs were $50 million lower than they would have been had the flights not been cancelled. Third-quarter per-share profit was also dented by $0.45.\n\"Because the faulty update could not be removed remotely, CrowdStrike crippled Delta's business and created immense delays for Delta customers,\" the airline said in its lawsuit.\nAmid the fallout from the outage, Delta brought on David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner to seek damages from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft, including compensation for losses and litigation expenses related to the matter.\nIn a statement late on Friday cited by Reuters, CrowdStrike said Delta's claims were based on \"disproven misinformation\" and \"demostrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works.\" The lawsuit was a \"desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure,\" CrowdStrike added.\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\nRelated Articles\nCrowdStrike shares slightly lower premarket amid Delta lawsuit over summer outage\nMorgan Stanley explains why rates are rising\nEuropean shares gain as key data and US tech earnings loom\nView Comments"

The investment firm believes that the broader economy has been stronger than anticipated with GDP growth running at an annualized rate of 3.0% in Q2. The blue-chip benchmark, S&P 500 index, has surged ~22% on a YTD basis. Also, the US fixed-income markets saw strong returns. Overall, the financial markets were supported by the success of the US Fed in dealing with inflation.\nInterest rates have started to move lower, with credit markets reflecting the strength of the broader US corporate sector, per AXA Investment Managers. At the start of October 2024, the investment firm mentioned that a 50:50 allocation to the S&P 500 Growth equity index and the ICE US High Yield bond index might have resulted in a return of ~18% YTD.\nS&P 500 Index \u2013 The Road Ahead\nForbes believes that the prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. While the momentum in technology innovation, together with the environment of lower interest rates, should help the broader S&P 500 index, investors are required to be wary of certain risks. These include elevated valuations, global tensions, and uncertainty regarding the US presidential election.\nAccording to ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, which is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor (RIA), the ongoing innovation in AI and lower rates should help the\u00a0S&P 500 Index see growth in the range of 14.5% \u2013 19.6%. Another firm, Running Point Capital Advisors, expects the S&P 500 to see an increase of 7% \u2013 11% in 2025, with some volatility.

As per IDC, worldwide spending on AI, which includes AI-enabled applications, infrastructure, and associated IT and business services, should more than double by 2028 to reach $632 billion. The incorporation of AI, and generative AI (GenAI) in particular, in a range of products should result in a\u00a0CAGR of ~29.0% over 2024-2028, which should help the broader technology sector.\nStory Continues\nDefinitive Healthcare believes that investors should see more device makers and pharmaceutical companies jump on the D2C bandwagon in 2025. Also, ICRA, a Credit Rating Agency, expects a strong financial outlook for the broader hospital industry in FY 2025. The optimistic outlook stems from the increasing incidence of non-communicable lifestyle diseases, a rise in per capita healthcare spending, increased medical tourism, and penetration of health insurance.\nUS Energy Information Administration, in its short-term energy outlook report (October 2024), mentioned that the summer temperatures this year were warmer in the US as compared to last summer, mainly in the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which supported pushing up the US electricity demand. EIA expects 2% more U.S. sales of electricity to ultimate customers in 2024 as compared to 2023, followed by another 2% expected growth in 2025.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.\nWall Street analysts opine that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s long-term growth trajectory is expected to be aided by its competitive advantages, which stem from\u00a0intangible assets in chip design and switching costs for the software products.

As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

          "whole_article": "Another kitchen sink type of earnings day from chip giant Intel (INTC).\nIntel stock (INTC) rose slightly in premarket trading on Friday as the struggling US icon managed to serve up better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Shares had been up about 8% late Thursday, but a cautious earnings call subdued sentiment.\n\"This was a critical quarter for us, and I think [it] gives optimism for what is to come,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance moments after the company's earnings call ended (video above).\n\u2022 USD\n(INTC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe somewhat positive market reaction may be a tad overdone when digging into the quarterly results.\nIntel revealed $15.9 billion in total non-cash charges related to inventory write-downs and lower performance expectations for certain businesses, such as autonomous driving firm Mobileye (MBLY), where it owns a majority stake. The company reported a $5.8 billion operating loss at Intel Foundry \u2014 Intel's upstart chipmaking business \u2014 on $4.4 billion in sales.\nIntel took a cautious stance on the health of the foundry business and its artificial intelligence product roadmap in 2025.\n\"The bad news, in our view, is that Intel's AI strategy appears to have changed again, now with what seems to be a longer-term approach that centers on the traditional CPU+co-processor/accelerator approach to Enterprise class AI workloads,\" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note on Friday.\nOn the earnings call, management promised to continue executing a $10 billion cost-cutting plan and exploring alternative sources of funding to support chipmaking ambitions.\nGelsinger told Yahoo Finance that no deal is imminent in terms of external funding.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger holds a sample of a wafer during his keynote speech at Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images\nHe reiterated that Intel will push forward with opening chipmaking plants in states like Ohio and Arizona despite not receiving billions of dollars in funding yet from the CHIPS Act.\nThe Biden administration has earmarked $8.5 billion in direct funding to Intel for its projects, but the company is still awaiting the cash as government officials iron out milestones that it must hit.\n\"Overall, we are seeing the CHIPS Act as a critical thing that we've invested a lot of time and energy into, and as we said on our earnings call, we're disappointed by the time that it's taken to get done,\" Gelsinger said.\n\"It's well over two years since the CHIPS Act passed. And over that period, I've invested $30 billion in US manufacturing and we've seen $0 from the CHIPS Act. This has taken too long. We need to get it finished.\"\nTo be sure, Wall Street still sees a bumpy road ahead for Intel.\nStory Continues\nIntel faces an \"uphill battle\" to turn itself around and compete with the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Taiwan's TSMC (TSM), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari recently told Yahoo Finance.\nHe added the company will need some time to get its technology \u2014 notably AI chips \u2014 on par with its rivals, if they can do it at all.\nAnd BofA analyst Vivek Arya struck a cautious tone on Intel in a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast (listen here).\nGelsinger also clarified the company's relationship with TSMC to Yahoo Finance.\nReuters reported that Gelsinger made comments early on in his Intel tenure that strained the relationship with the semiconductor manufacturing giant. In turn, TSMC pulled a discount it was giving Intel on 3-nanometer wafers.\n\"They are an awesome company. They have just created the foundry model. They service customers extremely well, and they service us well. And, Lunar Lake, the AI PC that we spoke about, we couldn't do it without TSMC \u2014 they've been critical to that project's success,\" Gelsinger said.\n\"That said, we want to be a Western foundry at scale, and we think that's seminally important for the Western world. ... And finally, I supply them with some of our advanced equipment as well.

The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMicrosoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from \u201cthird parties\u201d weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software.\n\u201cMicrosoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can\u2019t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,\u201d wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\nPersistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft\u2019s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen.\nCEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark.

He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be \u201clikely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.\u201d\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u2019 quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company\u2019s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday.\nStory Continues\nTo be sure, Big Tech companies\u2019 AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google\u2019s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the BofA's List Of AI & Semiconductor Stocks That Fund Managers Love & Hate: 16 Stocks On The Manager Radar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate.\nThe initial wave of artificial intelligence investing has shaken up the stock market. Suddenly, technology stocks are divided between those that have exposure to AI and those that don't. The former category has soared to set records while the latter has been lackluster because of the state of sluggishness in the non-AI business world.\nWithin AI stocks that have outdone themselves, semiconductor stocks are a standout. Additionally, just as is the case with broader technology stocks, semiconductor stocks are also divided between those with AI and non-AI exposure. The best example of the former category is Wall Street's top AI stock pick. This stock is of a firm that designs and sells GPUs used to process AI workloads. Its shares are up 845% since the 2023 start and have set multiple records since OpenAI's Chat GPT became publicly available.\nOn the flip side, another semiconductor stock has floundered during the same period even though it's one of the oldest and largest semiconductor companies in the world. This stock belongs to a firm that is also one of the only three companies in the world that can manufacture high-end semiconductors and it is the only one which is headquartered in the US. While the GPU designer's shares have gained 845%, over the same time, this semiconductor stock is down 13.9%, and year to date the shares have bled an unbelievable 53.14%.\nTherein lies the bifurcation between semiconductor stocks that is fueled by the artificial intelligence wave. However, these returns might belong to the first stage of AI stocks only, implying that other semiconductor companies could also see gains provided robust AI software demand and the ability of firms to monetize their products.\u00a0 We covered a lot of such potential stocks as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks.\nIn this list, there were five semiconductor stocks. Four of these are semiconductor manufacturers while the remaining stock is the firm whose designs are the backbone of the modern-day smartphone industry. The stocks are ranked 19th, 16th, 14th, 8th, and 6th. Looking at their year-to-date performance, these stocks are up roughly 45%, 51.7%, 65.7%, 97.8%, and 122% year-to-date, respectively. Safe to say, the AI wave has been kind to these stocks. The next step in our brief analysis is to see what analysts believe the future holds for these firms. To do this, one particularly useful ratio is the forward price to earnings since it gauges the current price to analyst estimates of future earnings.\nStory Continues\nFor these five phase two AI semiconductor stocks, the forward P/E ratios in respective orders are roughly 31.25, 50.51, 29.41, 25.19, and 99 times. The forward P/E ratio for global and US semiconductor stocks is 45.77 so most of these stocks are fairly valued. Consequently, this implies that in case of an AI correction that sees investor sentiment evaporate for any reason, these stocks might not be hit as hard as those speculating about an 'AI bubble' might worry, but if Wall Street finds more reasons to add to its AI euphoria, then their valuation might further bloom for more gains.\nShifting gears, the average forward P/E ratio for the semiconductor industry also leads us to wonder which stocks are driving this average value higher. After all, the six AI chip stocks we've covered above include some of the biggest companies in the world. However, high P/E ratios commonly belong to smaller companies that earn small profits but have a much higher share price. Two stocks that we've identified that have at least 2x the average forward P/E ratio are both unprofitable right now. The one with the higher forward P/E ratio of 196.08 ranks 20th on our list of Piper Sandler\u2019s Top Technical Stock Picks: 20 Best Stocks while the second with a beefy ratio of 133.33 ranked 32nd on this list of AI stocks that were recently trending.\nSo, the next question to ask is, what makes these stocks so special that despite the fact that neither is currently profitable, investors have valued their shares more than 100 times over their projected earnings? Well, starting from the first stock with the higher P/E ratio, this firm is one of the few hardened integrated circuit manufacturers in the US. It makes radiation-resistant chips for the US military and its tools enable chip designs at various nodes. The second stock, which is up 49% year to date, is a specialty chip manufacturer that makes and sells silicon-based timing devices as an alternative to quartz-based products. These are used in applications such as edge computing and 5G networks - systems that are closer to end users and therefore must endure more strenuous working environments.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of semiconductor stocks that fund managers love and hate according to BofA, we used its recent list of semiconductor stocks that were popular or losing popularity with fund managers. The list was divided into two sections based on expansion or decline in ownership.\u00a0 Stocks within each category were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. For an interesting exercise, you can also compare these stocks with those on our lists of Goldman Sachs\u2019 List Of Stocks That Hedge & Mutual Funds Love & Hate: 28 Stocks On The Mutual and Hedge Funds Radar.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 130\nSection: Gaining Popularity\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a diversified technology company with a presence in the semiconductor and SaaS industries. It has exposure to the semiconductor industry via modems, network controllers, network processors, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These allow Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) products to operate in the smartphone, laptop, and data center industries. The firm also benefits from its ASIC business as it allows it to. work with companies interested in designing their custom AI chips. Consequently, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0 has a wide semiconductor moat which allows it to profit from several industries. Its cybersecurity business adds margin-heavy revenue to the income statement, making Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) one of the most well-rounded firms in the world. However, with Apple's propensity to shift to its in-house chips, the firm could see headwinds in the future if Apple decides to self-design and make chips such as MacBook WiFi modules.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

OpenAI has been planning a custom chip and working on such uses for the technology for around a year, the people said, but the discussions are still at an early stage.\nOpenAI declined to comment. A representative for Broadcom didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and a TSMC spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on rumors and speculation. Reuters reported on OpenAI\u2019s ongoing talks with Broadcom and TSMC on Tuesday. The Information reported in June that Broadcom had discussed making an AI chip for OpenAI.\nThe process for taking a chip from design to production is long and expensive. OpenAI is less focused on graphics processing units, chips that are used to train and build generative AI models \u2014 a market that has been cornered by Nvidia Corp. Instead, it\u2019s looking for a specialized chip that will run the software and respond to user requests, a process called inference. Investors and analysts expect the need for chips to support inference will only grow as more tech companies use AI models to field more complex tasks.\nOpenAI may continue to research setting up its own network of foundries, or chip factories, one of the people said, but the startup has realized that working with partners on custom chips is a quicker, attainable path for now. Reuters earlier reported that OpenAI was pulling back from the effort of establishing its own chip manufacturing capacity.\nBroadcom shares closed up 4.2% to $179.24 in New York trading on Tuesday. Even before the latest gain, they were up 54% this year. TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares closed more than 1% higher.\nBroadcom is the largest designer of application-specific integrated circuits \u2014 chips designed to fit a single purpose specified by the customer. The company\u2019s biggest customer in this area is Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Broadcom also works with Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\nStory Continues\nWhen asked last month whether he has new customers for the business, given the huge demand for AI training, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that he will only add to his short list of customers when projects hit volume shipments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy product to deploy for any customer, and so we do not consider proof of concepts as production volume,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call.\nOpenAI\u2019s services require massive amounts of computing power to develop and run \u2014 with much of that coming from Nvidia chips. To meet the demand, the industry has been scrambling to find alternatives to Nvidia. That\u2019s included embracing processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and developing in-house versions.\nOpenAI is also actively planning investments and partnerships in data centers, the eventual home for such AI chips. The startup\u2019s leadership has pitched the US government on the need for more massive data centers and CEO Sam Altman has sounded out global investors, including some in the Middle East, to finance the effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stretch,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told Bloomberg Television on Monday. \u201cStretch from a capital perspective but also my own learning.

Currently, OpenAI has assembled a team of roughly 20 chip engineers, including experts with experience designing Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Together, they hope to develop OpenAI's first custom chip by 2026\u2014though that timeline is flexible.\nThe news on Tuesday sent Broadcom Inc. shares up 4% and TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares gained more than 1%.\nThe move reflects OpenAI's ongoing strategy to secure consistent chip supply and manage escalating costs, a challenge that other tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft have also faced in their AI ventures. This effort includes OpenAI\u2019s recent decision to integrate AMD chips, along with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, which continue to dominate the market but are in limited supply. In fact, tech giants have been literally begging Nvidia for more chips.\nAt a meeting with analysts last month, billionaire\u00a0Oracle\u00a0cofounder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said he and world\u2019s-richest-man Elon Musk took Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang out to dinner at\u00a0Nobu\u00a0Palo Alto and \u201cbegged\u201d for more GPUs.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The market for ServiceNow, Inc.'s (NYSE:NOW) shares didn't move much after it posted weak earnings recently. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nSee our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-history\nZooming In On ServiceNow's Earnings\nOne key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.\nServiceNow has an accrual ratio of -0.40 for the year to September 2024. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$3.4b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$1.34b. ServiceNow shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On ServiceNow's Profit Performance\nAs we discussed above, ServiceNow's accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is a positive for the company. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that ServiceNow's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at an extremely impressive rate over the last three years. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing ServiceNow at this point in time. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for ServiceNow and you'll want to know about these.\nStory Continues\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of ServiceNow's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "Bill McDermott is very intense.\u00a0When he first joined ServiceNow as CEO in 2019\u2014he was previously CEO of SAP\u2014he met all 7,000 employees and shook hands with every single one of them.\n\u201cIn the first hundred days I was here, I travelled the whole world. The whole world. I met every single person that works for this company in person, and shook their hand.\u201d\nHandshake intensity is a thing, in McDermott's world.\nThe first handshake is incredibly important, he says. It\u2019s part of his mindset, especially for dealing with clients. He advises sales people, upon entering a room with a prospective client, to \u201cfind the decision-maker and shake his hand, but be the last one to let go.\u201d\nHe spoke to Fortune recently in a penthouse suite at the Four Seasons hotel in London, during a business trip to meet clients.\nQuestion 1: Does this handshake thing really work?\n\u201cYes, it does.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not a perfunctory exercise to greet somebody. It's not a perfunctory exercise to shake somebody's hand. They have to know you're in the room and you have to let them know that you care,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo just to shake hands as if it's just some standard thing to do is not enough.\u201d\n(So, was my handshake any good? \u201cYou were fine. I wasn't judging you.\u201d)\nMcDermott\u2019s stewardship of ServiceNow is certainly working. Five years later, ServiceNow has 26,000 employees, revenues of $2.8 billion per quarter and a market cap of more than $195 billion.\nThe AI-driven enterprise software company counts clients such as IBM, KPMG, and Deloitte, for whom it provides a vast range of back-end software that handles customer service, IT operations, security, and new employee on-boarding, among dozens of other services.\nThe handshake thing is a good example of McDermott\u2019s intense, driven style. This is a man who only sleeps for five hours a night. He wakes up at 5 a.m., reads three newspapers, drinks an espresso, does a light workout and walks his dog, Amber. He\u2019s in the office by 8 a.m. He usually continues working until 11 p.m. at night.\nQuestion 2: Can you really get by on just five hours\u2019 sleep?\n\u201cFive hours a night, you know, which is fine,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the week, you know, like it's \u2018go time.\u2019\u201d\nHe sleeps a bit more on weekends.\nQuestion 3: Does ServiceNow have supply issues with Nvidia?\nMost products offered by ServiceNow are driven by AI.\nSo is he getting what he needs from Nvidia, the AI chipmaker that has been accused of not being able to meet demand for all its customers?\n\u201cPerhaps we're fortunate because we have such a strategic relationship but Nvidia has fulfilled all of our requirements and done a great job,\u201d he says.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe started building models with Jensen [Huang, the CEO] several years ago, and we were the first mover in enterprise software building with Nvidia's GPU stack.\u201d\nQuestion 4: Will you cave to Robby Starbuck?\nMcDermott isn\u2019t afraid of the usual culture-war controversies that have come to bedevil leaders at large corporations. ServiceNow, for instance, has a well-developed, public facing DEI program, of the type that has lately become unfashionable.\nRobby Starbuck\u2014the conservative activist who organizes boycotts of companies that he believes are too \u201cwoke\u201d\u2014recently forced Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson, among others, to back away from their DEI initiatives.\nSo what will McDermott do if Starbuck comes calling?\n\u201cWell the good news about ServiceNow is we haven't played \u2018acronym bingo,\u2019\u201d McDermott says.\n\u201cIf you're not growing and you're managing and all you talk about is corporate acronyms, that could be a problem for that phone call. But when you're growing like we are, we have to source talent from every corner of the earth to keep up with the pace of our growth. So if we didn't believe in diversity, if we didn't have an equitable and an inclusive culture, there's no way we could be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. So I think that call would be pretty simple.\u201d\nQuestion 5: Is working remotely OK?\nMcDermott is not a fan of 100% remote working. He asked the company to return to the office about two years ago. ServiceNow currently has a flexible policy in which some employees come in two days a week unless they are designated remote workers.\n\u201cI believe strongly that people do their best work in person.\u201d\n\u201cWe need everybody in the company to cross-pollinate and innovate and work as teams. So, basically, when I asked the company to do it, I didn't have to mandate it. I just had to say, we need it now, we have to hit the accelerator, people came back.\u201d\nBut when the CEO says \u201cwe need it now,\u201d surely that's a mandate?\n\u201cIf they trust you, it's not a mandate. It's a desire. It is \u2018I need you. I trust you. I want you with me.\u2019 I'm not telling you I have to have you tied to a chair, and I'm not telling you I'm going to fire you if you don't do it. I'm telling you, I need you to do it and I don't ask for things that I don't need. And they responded next day, the parking lots are all full. There\u2019s a difference between leading and managing and I don't think it's healthy to actually have people that feel forced into things,\u201d he says. \u201cOne volunteer is worth 10 pressed people.\u201d\nQuestion 6: Are you a micromanager or do you prefer to delegate?\nThis question is important because McDermott has, in the past, insisted on riding along on sales calls with his staff.\n\u201cI hire people that are the best in the world at what they do and I trust them with my life. I think trust is the ultimate human currency and I think the best leaders hire people that are substantially better than them. In every area of domain expertise. So, if you have a CFO, they have to be better than you at finance. If you have a CHRO, they have to know more about the people equation than you do. If you hire a head of engineering, they have to be an extraordinary exemplar of an engineering manager and they should know a lot more than you do. In other words, when I look around the table of my leadership team, I'm humbled, that's how good they are.\u201d\n\u201cI also believe strongly that we have to go into the details and we have to be with our customers and we have to be shoulder to shoulder with the customer so you understand the pain that they deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cI become obsessed with their problems. And I want 26,000 people to be obsessed with their problems, so we come up with new solutions to make them better.\u201d\nQuestion 7: What is the most difficult thing you have tackled as CEO?\nGrowing the company from 7,000 people to 26,000 must have involved some difficulties. But McDermott won't admit it.\n\u201cI love scale. I came here from a company that had a hundred thousand people. So my whole life has been spent scaling companies, so the things that people might find difficult, we find great joy in, we bring new people into the culture, we get new people to buy into the\u00a0purpose.\u201d\nThat sounds like PR spin. Surely there must have been pain points while growing ServiceNow?\n\u201cI've encountered thousands of challenges, but is that a difficulty? Or is that a challenge? Is that A setback? Or is that an opportunity,\u201d he says.\nAnd then, just in case you needed a reminder of the level of intensity he is working at, he adds:\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what is pain? Your pain might be my pleasure.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Top findings include a group of AI Pacesetters\u2014government organizations relatively more advanced in using AI and other emerging technologies\u2014that are driving efficiency and achieving better outcomes than organizations that have been slower to adopt AI-powered workflows and automation. Key insights illuminate the unique ways Pacesetters use AI to improve citizen and employee experiences, strengthen compliance, and scale business processes.\nAccording to the research, many government organizations have yet to reap the full benefits of digital technology and relatively few are leveraging innovation to advance their diverse missions. The report outlines best practices implemented by Pacesetters that can be replicated in other government organizations to improve outcomes.\n\"In today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, governments need AI-driven solutions to meet the evolving expectations of citizens and employees,\" said Jonathan Alboum, Federal CTO at ServiceNow. \"This report reinforces that leading governments are already reaping the benefits of AI through accelerated service delivery, citizen experience, and employee productivity. Whether you\u2019re a Pacesetter or still in the beginning stages of a digital journey, these findings show that the future is promising for those willing to embrace AI.\"\nKey findings from The State of AI-Powered Transformation in Government include:\nImproving Speed of Mission\nPacesetters significantly improve their speed and agility by integrating automation into their organizations\u2019 processes. This profoundly impacts both government employees and the citizens they serve.\nFaster time to value with more benefits. Most Pacesetters (61%) achieve a 1.5X faster return on digital investments and report greater outcomes from those investments \u2013 including higher asset utilization and return (50%), improved compliance and risk management (49%), and faster public services (41%).\nAutomating workflows with end-to-end platforms. Pacesetters are making greater progress in implementing end-to-end platforms, with 67% expecting to make advanced progress within the next three years. Currently, 59% have invented new cross-functional workflows that leverage human and AI collaboration.\nAccelerating productivity and ability to scale transformation. Pacesetters boost productivity via specific digital solutions, such as mobile apps (64%), performance management systems (43%), and AI-enabled tools (38%). Those investments are paying off for Pacesetters, measured by improved staff retention (49%), employee upskilling and reskilling (44%), and productivity (41%).\nStory Continues\nAI-Powered Citizen Service Delivery\nPacesetters are finding new momentum within their Citizen Experience (CX) efforts through unique uses of AI and other digital solutions. This is not only improving citizen service delivery but also helping build trust.\nReshaping government services with AI. Governments are using AI in various ways to accelerate citizen service delivery. The top uses for AI among Pacesetters include personalization of citizen communication and engagement, continuous service improvement with feedback loops, and citizen queries and recommendations.\nTechnology improves citizen experience and builds trust. Pacesetters are making greater use of apps and automation to reach citizens. Compared to the general population of government agencies in our survey, Pacesetters are more likely to deploy mobile apps that citizens can use to access government services (47%), digital identities for easy and secure access to public services (46%), and automated responses to citizen problems or requests (44%).\nTech investments are beginning to drive CX improvements. Those embracing AI are starting to see the tangible CX benefits from their digital solutions investments, reporting higher increases in self-service success (47%) and higher citizen satisfaction (45%).\nTo view the full research report and uncover how governments across the globe can improve their AI-driven transformation, please visit: https://www.servicenow.com/lpwhp/state-of-ai-powered-transformation-in-government.html.\nMethodology\nServiceNow and ThoughtLab surveyed 1,248 leaders from around the globe and across agency types to determine how much progress government organizations have made in driving AI-powered business transformation across local, state/provincial, and national government organizations.\nAbout ServiceNow:\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the UBS' Top Tech Based Disruptive Stocks For 2030: Top 29 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software as a service (SaaS) firm that provides business process management products and services. This means that the stock and the firm's revenue are dependent on business activity which is influenced by economic health. Consequently, as the economy has continued to chug along in 2024, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s stock is up 38% year to date. Over its four latest quarters, the firm has raked in $1.3 billion in trailing twelve month net income on the back of continued deal diversification. Through this, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) grew its customers with recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% in Q2, and it added six new customers with annual contract value greater than $10 million in Q3. These metrics are key for SaaS companies like ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) as they help broaden the revenue base and add margin heavy revenue to the income statement.\nDuring the Q3 2024 earnings call, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s management shared key details about its deals:\n\"From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was very strong, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Retail and Hospitality also had a fantastic quarter, growing over 80% year-over-year. Health care and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date, U.S. Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution, further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and two over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nOverall NOW ranks 8th on our list of UBS' top tech based disruptive stocks for 2030. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) Thrives with Strong Growth and Profitability\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 1.88%\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the biggest SaaS companies in the world. The firm provides products that enable users to automate their business processes and manage human resource operations, IT operations, and others. The firm has raked in $1.1 billion in trailing twelve-month net income and its shares are up 33.5% year to date. Since it\u2019s a SaaS stock, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u2019s narrative depends on its ability to sustain revenue levels, maintain profitability, grow its customer base, and increase the portion of larger deals within the overall mix. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) appears to be executing well on these fronts. During the second quarter, the firm grew customers with annual recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% and its committed remaining performance obligations by 31% to a whopping $18.6 billion. The latter is a particularly important metric since it measures the money that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is nearly guaranteed to receive in the future. This helps evaluate the firm\u2019s future cash flows.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in\u00a0Adobe\u00a0and\u00a0ServiceNow\u00a0earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 6th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ServiceNow, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NOW a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $13.83.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.3%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.36 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for NOW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Good afternoon, everyone, I really appreciate you joining today. Because a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report, I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow is growth trajectory. First is elite level execution, with our Q3 results we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution.\nWe outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand. The defense logistics agency works with ServiceNow assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project. Bangkok de Brazil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation.\nThe Veterans Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the Veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI powered solutions to improve its colleague experience.\nAfter rolling out now assist globally, EY works with ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks to deliver faster resolutions for enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life saving mission.\nMercedes Benz work to its ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"
