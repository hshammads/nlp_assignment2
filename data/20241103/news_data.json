          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors had hoped earnings from five of the world\u2019s biggest companies would shake the stocks out of a malaise and provide a fresh jolt for the S&P 500.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIstanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers\nThe Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards\nIs Denver\u2019s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off?\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nChicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow\nInstead, in many cases they were left wanting.\nWhile Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all topped analyst expectations for sales and profits last week, the results weren\u2019t strong enough to justify their lofty multiples relative to the broader market.\nWith few reasons to bid up the group, technology investors hit the sell button, resulting in a 1.8% drop in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, with only Alphabet and Amazon ending the week in the green. The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, weighed down by the big-tech group.\n\u201cInvestors had higher numbers in mind,\u201d said Michael Casper, equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThey\u2019re expecting more from AI and these AI projects than what they\u2019ve gotten so far.\u201d\nThe issue isn\u2019t the current quarter per se: the group of seven companies is on track to deliver profit growth of 30% in three-month period through September, which would beat the estimate of 18% at the start of earnings season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\nThe trouble is next year\u2019s profit outlook remains murky with the tech giants continuing to spend heavily on infrastructure to support more AI computing power. Analysts have been cutting their 2025 profit-growth projections for the Magnificent Seven cohort since earnings season began more than two weeks ago.\nHigher spending on artificial intelligence dominated Magnificent Seven earnings this season. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta pumped a record $59 billion into capital expenditures in the third quarter while pledging to spend significantly more next year.\n\u201cRight now you have a little bit of Silicon Valley arrogance that says, we just are going to spend, because we know better than you do,\u201d said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W Baird & Co.\nWhile there were signs that revenue from AI-related demand is picking up steam, the message from management teams was that investors will need to wait longer for the big payoffs to show up.\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI business is on track to exceed an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which would make it the fastest business in the company\u2019s history to reach that milestone, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said on the earnings call.\nStory Continues\nSignificant Costs\nHowever, those sales come with significant costs. Microsoft\u2019s commercial cloud margin will narrow in the current quarter as capital expenditures continue to ramp up, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said.\nThat didn\u2019t sit well with many investors when coupled with a forecast for slower quarterly cloud revenue growth. Microsoft shares tumbled 6.1% the day after its earnings, the biggest drop in two years. Combined with a disappointing revenue forecast from Meta Platforms, traders headed for the exits.\nAll told, technology, media and telecom stocks collectively saw the largest net selling in five weeks, according to Goldman Sachs prime brokerage report.\nRead: Big Tech Stocks Lose Some of Their Aura as Earnings Growth Slows\n\u201cAs long as these companies are going to keep spending like this, they have to back it up on the revenue side and the revenue bar is very high,\u201d BI\u2019s Casper said. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern for the next few quarters.\u201d\nThere were bright spots, of course. Amazon, which has been dogged by concerns about pressure on margins from big spending, soothed nerves when its forecast for operating profit for the current quarter exceeded expectations.\nSean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, came away from this week encouraged that AI-related sales growth is sufficient to justify the higher spending.\n\u201cFor many of these companies, growth is accelerating and margins are improving and that\u2019s what you want to see,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe AI winners will continue to perform.\u201d\nHowever, other questions hanging over the tech giants heading into earnings went unanswered.\nApple, whose shares have soared on optimism that new AI features will reinvigorate sluggish revenue growth, gave a sales forecast for the current quarter that fell short of the average analyst estimate.\nTo BI\u2019s Casper, this week\u2019s earnings did little to tarnish the relative attraction of cheaper S&P 500 sectors that have outperformed big-tech stocks since July.\n\u201cThe story is still that the rest of the S&P 500\u2019s growth rates are starting to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad story for tech by any stretch, but maybe some other groups get to have some fun now.\u201d\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nTrump\u2019s Immigration Policy Would Make Food Inflation Even Worse\nHow to End the Backlog of Asylum Cases?

          "whole_article": "The quarterly results this week of Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) provided an AI-era playbook for making investors patiently wait for results on massive infrastructure spending.\nAlphabet dazzled Wall Street on Tuesday with earnings that beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong growth in its cloud business. The company posted profit and sales increases of 37% and 15%, respectively, compared to the year prior.\nEven as investors in recent months have expressed some impatience with the tech industry's enormous investments in AI technology, Google showed that a dominant performance of its core business can alleviate those concerns.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAmazon, too, offered a resounding earnings beat. The company posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. The stellar report helped offset lingering concerns about mounting capital expenditures.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call Thursday that \"as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and Jassy said the company plans to spend \"more than that\" in 2025.\nThe e-commerce giant's approach to selling AI spending was also helped by claims that new revenue has already arrived. While Amazon has not disclosed exact figures for AI-related sales, Jassy has said the AI business inside of its cloud unit has generated several billion dollars. And on Thursday he added that the business is growing at a \"triple-digit year-over-year percentage.\u201d\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy expects to spend even more money in 2025 on capital expenditures, driven by the development of AI technology. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut investors have not given all the big-spending tech companies the same leeway when it comes to ballooning capital expenditures.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) were met with a more unforgiving investor response this week, even as both tech giants beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue. Investors sent both stocks lower after their respective reports. Wall Street recoiled after executives of both companies said they expect capex to continue increasing in the quarters to come.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth next year and revised its expectation upward for 2024 capex. The uneasiness among investors harkens back to Facebook's prior spending spree, when Reality Labs lost more than $13 billion and shares in the company tanked 60% in 2022. Zuckerberg has since improved the company's financials and its standing on Wall Street, but he's also prompted a fresh round of jitters.\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's boosted AI spending came with its own troublesome news: The company said it expects slower growth in its cloud business, highlighting the risks of dedicating major resources to AI development without the returns to offset them.\nBoth Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have framed their spending on AI as worthwhile endeavors, helping to massage the worries of investing in a new technology with uncertain returns. Earlier this year Pichai addressed Wall Street's fears head on: \"The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.\u201d In his view, spending too much on AI is a small price to pay for claiming a leadership position in a future AI-dominated landscape.\nJassy offered a similar argument on Thursday, describing generative AI as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\nGoogle and Amazon investors appear to be taking them at their word.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

          "whole_article": "As smartphone companies fight to be the first to launch the latest generative AI features in their iPhones, Apple is taking its time. The company is facing weak iPhone sales and seems to be behind in the AI race. But all that could change once the first Apple Intelligence device hits the market.\nApple Inc. (AAPL) is a multinational technology powerhouse that designs, develops, and markets electronic devices, software, and services. The core product offerings include iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. With a firm emphasis on visual aesthetics, user interaction, and smooth unification of hardware and software, the company has set itself apart from the competition.\nApple has built a strong ecosystem that cultivates brand loyalty through integrated product portfolios, including iCloud and App Store. The leading products of the tech giant include iPhone, iPad, Mac, wearables such as Apple Watch and AirPods, and services, particularly App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, and other subscription services.\n10 Smartphones with the Best Cameras and Battery Life\nApple's leading clientele includes consumers across varied demographics who acquire Apple products online or directly from retail stores. The end market comprises a diverse tech-savvy customer base desiring cutting-edge technology and premium design for personal use, business solutions, and creative sectors.\nThe main sources of revenue are sales of hardware products, such as iPhones, iPads, and Macs, sustained income from services and subscriptions, and digital content sales via platforms like the AppStore. iPhone continues to be the biggest moneymaker for the company, accounting for more than 50% of the revenue.\nWith such a dominant role to play in Apple's success, the iPhone attracts a lot of attention from analysts. Many analysts try to estimate the iPhone sales number by tracking the supply chain. And they aren't impressed by the current situation. Apple has been late in launching AI features in its iPhones when its competition has already offered the latest generative AI features to its users.\nApple's China sales took a hit in the previous quarter for this reason. Even when Apple did announce AI features in smartphones, they weren't available in China's local languages, giving people no incentive to upgrade their iPhones.\nAll of this has happened before as well. Apple isn't known for being the first to offer innovative features. It usually lets other companies do that before entering the market itself. It can do that because of its unique ecosystem. People aren't willing to switch to another phone simply because one feature isn't there.\nStory Continues\nThis means Apple's AI features could be more mature than what other companies are offering. Once they hit the market, they could drive the need to upgrade phones from previous versions.\nApple has already announced its new Mac Mini, a 5-inch by 5-inch device that will contain Apple Intelligence features. The Mac Mini starts at $599 and can already be pre-ordered. As investors wait eagerly for the Q4 earnings report, it may be a better idea to keep an eye on Mac Mini sales rather than the devices that were sold last quarter.\nIf Apple Intelligence is well received, we could be at the beginning of the next bull run that could inch the company toward the $5 trillion mark.\nApple ranks 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 184 hedge fund portfolios held AAPL at the end of the second quarter which was 150 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

Courtyards\nIs Denver\u2019s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off?\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nChicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow\nBerkshire once again cut its holdings in Apple Inc., the Omaha, Nebraska-based company said Saturday in a statement. Its stake in the iPhone maker was valued at $69.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $84.2 billion in the second quarter, indicating that Berkshire cut its stake by about 25%.\nBerkshire first disclosed its Apple stake in 2016 and had spent $31.1 billion for the 908 million Apple shares it held through the end of 2021.\nBuffett said in May that Apple would likely remain Berkshire\u2019s top holding, indicating that tax issues had motivated the sale. \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position,\u201d he said at the annual shareholder meeting.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Warren Buffett\u2019s ever really been super comfortable with technology,\u201d said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones.\nCathy Seifert, a research analyst at CFRA, said Berkshire\u2019s Apple stake was \u201cstarting to become an outsized percentage\u201d of its overall portfolio. \u201cI think it made sense to sort of lighten that exposure a little bit,\u201d she said.\nNet Seller\nBerkshire reported $34.6 billion of net share sales in the three months through September.\nThe company has struggled to find ways to deploy its cash pile, as Buffett has found market prices too high to find attractive deals. At the annual meeting, Buffett said Berkshire wasn\u2019t in a rush to spend \u201cunless we think we\u2019re doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money.\u201d\nHigher yields on cash holdings set \u201cthe bar a little bit higher for other opportunities,\u201d Shanahan said.\nInterest and other investment income has more than doubled at the conglomerate\u2019s insurance business, reaching $3.5 billion in the three months through September.\nBuffett, 94, has used some of the cash hoard to repurchase some of its own stock, though even that had become costlier recently. Shares of Berkshire have gained 25% this year, boosting its market value to $974.3 billion. Its market capitalization eclipsed $1 trillion for the first time on Aug. 28.\nStory Continues\nThis past quarter, Berkshire declined to buy back its own stock for the first time since it changed its policy in 2018.\n\u201cI think investors are going to be disappointed by that,\u201d Seifert said.\nOperating Earnings\nBerkshire\u2019s operating earnings fell 6% from a year earlier, to $10.09 billion, as insurance underwriting earnings slumped. The company also recorded a $1.1 billion foreign-currency-exchange loss during the quarter.\nEarnings from underwriting at the firm\u2019s collection of insurance businesses plunged 69%, to $750 million, versus $2.4 billion a year earlier, driven by higher losses at Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group.\nBerkshire estimated that the impact of hurricane Helene on its earnings this quarter came to $565 million. Hurricane Milton is expected to result in a pretax hit of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter.\nWhile earned premiums grew at car insurer GEICO, they declined about 5.6% across Berkshire\u2019s reinsurance businesses. Seifert said this could signal that Berkshire is embracing a \u201crisk-off\u201d strategy this quarter.\n(Updates details throughout starting in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nTrump\u2019s Immigration Policy Would Make Food Inflation Even Worse\nHow to End the Backlog of Asylum Cases?

          "whole_article": "Last week, you might have seen that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its annual result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 3.7% to US$223 in the past week. Apple reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$391b and statutory earnings per share of US$6.08, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Apple's 32 analysts is for revenues of US$414.8b in 2025. This would reflect a reasonable 6.1% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to step up 19% to US$7.40. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$420.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.40 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\nThere were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$242, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Apple, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$300 and the most bearish at US$184 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Apple shareholders.\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Apple's past performance and to peers in the same industry. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Apple's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 6.1% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 8.3% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.6% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Apple is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Apple's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$242, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Apple going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here..\nHowever, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Apple that you should be aware of.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "Apple Inc's robust product ecosystem and brand strength continue to be core pillars of its market dominance.\nDespite a slight decline in net sales and net income, Apple maintains a strong financial position with significant gross margins.\nOpportunities in new technology adoption and services expansion present potential growth avenues.\nGlobal economic conditions and aggressive competition pose persistent threats to Apple's market share and profitability.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 12 Warning Signs with DLR.\nOn November 1, 2024, Apple Inc, a titan in the technology industry, filed its annual 10-K report, revealing a comprehensive view of its financial performance and strategic direction. Apple, known for its innovative hardware and expansive software ecosystem, reported total net sales of $391,035 million for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, a slight decrease from the previous year's $383,285 million. Despite this, the company's gross margin improved to $180,683 million, indicating efficient cost management and a strong pricing strategy. However, net income saw a marginal decline to $93,736 million from $96,995 million in the previous year. With a robust balance sheet and a commitment to R&D, Apple stands poised to navigate the dynamic tech landscape.\nDecoding Apple Inc (AAPL): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nBrand Equity and Product Ecosystem: Apple Inc's unparalleled brand equity, built on a foundation of innovative design and user-centric experiences, continues to be a formidable strength. The company's integrated product ecosystem, centered around the iPhone, creates a seamless user experience that fosters customer loyalty and drives repeat purchases. This ecosystem, complemented by a growing services portfolio, including streaming video and subscription bundles, has enabled Apple to maintain a competitive edge and attract a premium customer base.\nFinancial Resilience: Apple's financial health remains robust, with a strong balance sheet characterized by significant gross margins and a consistent track record of profitability. Despite a slight dip in net sales and net income, the company's financial resilience is evident in its ability to generate substantial cash flows, allowing for strategic investments in R&D and potential market expansions. Apple's financial stability provides a solid foundation for enduring market fluctuations and investing in future growth opportunities.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Flagship Products: Apple's heavy reliance on its flagship product, the iPhone, which accounts for a majority of its sales, represents a vulnerability. This dependence on a single product line exposes the company to risks associated with market saturation, consumer preference shifts, and technological disruptions. Diversifying its revenue streams beyond the iPhone is crucial for Apple to mitigate this risk and ensure long-term stability.\nStory Continues\nSupply Chain Concentration: Apple's supply chain is highly concentrated with key subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC, which introduces potential risks related to supply disruptions. Geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, or other unforeseen events could significantly impact Apple's ability to manufacture and deliver products, necessitating a more diversified and resilient supply chain strategy.\nOpportunities\nTechnological Innovation: The technology sector is rapidly evolving, with new opportunities emerging in areas such as augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and health technology. Apple's strong R&D capabilities position it well to capitalize on these trends and introduce next-generation products and services that can open up new revenue streams and reinforce its market leadership.\nServices Expansion: Apple's services segment has shown promising growth, with a notable increase in net sales. Expanding its services offerings, such as Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and the potential introduction of new subscription models, presents a significant opportunity for Apple to diversify its revenue and deepen customer engagement.\nThreats\nIntense Competition: Apple operates in highly competitive markets where aggressive pricing, rapid technological advancements, and low-cost alternatives from rivals pose constant threats. Competitors with broader product lines or lower cost structures can challenge Apple's market share and profitability, necessitating continuous innovation and strategic marketing to maintain its competitive position.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainty: Macroeconomic factors, including trade tensions, currency fluctuations, and economic downturns, can adversely affect consumer spending and demand for Apple's premium products. The company must navigate these uncertainties by adapting its pricing strategies, exploring new markets, and managing costs effectively to sustain its financial performance.\nIn conclusion, Apple Inc's SWOT analysis reveals a company with formidable strengths, including a strong brand and a loyal customer base, which are balanced by vulnerabilities such as reliance on flagship products and supply chain risks. Opportunities in technological innovation and services expansion offer pathways for growth, while threats from intense competition and global economic uncertainty require vigilant management. Apple's strategic focus on leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, while capitalizing on opportunities and mitigating threats, will be critical in sustaining its leadership in the ever-evolving technology landscape.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

          "whole_article": "Of the six members of \u2018The Magnificent 7\u2019 group of stocks that have reported September-quarter results already, the market didn\u2019t like three \u2013 Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta META \u2013 but loved the Tesla TSLA report and liked what it saw from Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\nThe group ceded its market leadership role a few months back, and these mixed results can be interpreted to mean that the trend is now here to stay. In other words, the group\u2019s unambiguous market leadership of last year and early this year is now firmly behind us.\nI want to push back on part of this narrative, as most Mag 7 stocks provide some of the most sustainable growth performances in the entire market.\nAside from Apple, which is likely no longer a growth company, the other Mag 7 companies are not only generating impressive top- and bottom-line growth today, but the trend is expected to remain in place at least through next year, if not beyond.\nTake the case of Apple, which beat consensus estimates and whose Q3 earnings increased +8.8% from the year-earlier level to almost $25 billion on +6.1% higher revenues of nearly $95 billion. Apple may no longer command the growth pace of its peers like Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta, but it enjoys a degree of market dominance that is hard to dislodge by its competitors, let alone start-ups.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +10.7% on +16% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings increased +35.4% on +18.9% revenue growth. Both companies beat top- and bottom-line consensus estimates.\nIf one was nitpicking the results from these two companies, then signs of deceleration in Microsoft\u2019s cloud revenues and Meta\u2019s advertising revenues would be the only operating issues here. Is that the issue in the Microsoft and Meta reports, or is there something else at play?\nThe answer to that question lies in what Microsoft and Meta are doing to prepare for the artificial intelligence (AI) world. Each of them is heavily investing in building AI infrastructure, and the amounts involved are massive and bigger than\u00a0many in the markets had been expecting.\nIn fact, Microsoft and Meta are hardly alone in this boat, as Alphabet and Amazon are spending as heavily on AI infrastructure as these two.\nIn fact, Apple is the lone laggard in this regard, though it has started talking more about the AI capabilities embedded in its coming software upgrades that will require users to have the newest iPhones. However, we should remember\u00a0that unlike Apple, which is solely a consumer-facing operator whose AI functionalities will be targeted at consumers, the other Mag 7 players primarily target businesses with their AI offerings.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet and Amazon have been able to explain and show\u00a0the impact and contribution of AI spending level on its current and coming growth trajectory this earnings season. Microsoft and Meta didn\u2019t do a good job on that front.\nWe have no reason to think that these otherwise very well-run companies are throwing good money on questionable projects. As such, we like these companies investing in their future that will ensure their primacy and leadership status in the AI-centric future world. In other words, we think the market\u2019s capex fixation is overdone.\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period. The +30.5% earnings growth comprises actual results from the six group members that have reported and estimates for Nvidia (which reports on November 20th).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q3 earnings for the Technology sector are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +11.4% higher revenues. Please note that had it not been for the big hit that Intel took in Q3, earnings growth for the sector would be +30.5%.\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s growth picture on an annual basis.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks in the fore front of the rising estimates trend.\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nThrough Friday, November 1st, we have seen Q3 results from 350 S&P 500 members, or 70% of the index\u2019s total membership. With 104 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week, we will have seen Q3 results from more than 90% of the index\u2019s membership.\nTotal earnings for these 350 companies that have reported are up +8.8% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues, with 74.9% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 60.6% beating revenue estimates.\nThe proportion of these 350 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 50.3%.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. The first set of comparison charts show the earnings and revenue growth rates.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe second set of comparison charts compare the Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below spotlight the revenue performance and the blended beats percentage for this group of 350 index members.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the growth trend appears to be stable and positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter average for this group of companies, with the Q3 revenue beats percentage just a hair above the low point for the preceding 20-quarter period.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +6.8% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\nThe chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.\nHad it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +9.2% instead of +6.8%. Excluding the Tech sector\u2019s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be only +2% instead of +6.8%.\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +1.3% instead of +6.8%.\nFor the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues.\nUnlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better, as the chart below shows.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with the +7.5% earnings growth this year followed by double-digit gains in 2025 and 2026.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +7.5% earnings growth improves to +9.5% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Tech Flexes Earnings Power: A Closer Look\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the global leader in online retail and cloud computing services, has released its 10-Q filing on November 1, 2024, offering a detailed glimpse into its financial performance and operational strategies. The company continues to dominate with a diverse portfolio that includes retail sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and international operations. The financial overview from the recent filing indicates a robust increase in net income, from $9.879 billion in Q3 2023 to $15.328 billion in Q3 2024, and a significant rise in total net sales from $143.083 billion to $158.877 billion for the same period. This financial strength underpins Amazon's strategic initiatives and investments in technology and infrastructure, positioning it well for sustained growth and innovation.\nDecoding Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Brand Value: Amazon's brand is synonymous with online retail, boasting a vast customer base and unparalleled market reach. The company's net sales have shown a consistent upward trajectory, with a notable increase from $143.083 billion in Q3 2023 to $158.877 billion in Q3 2024. This growth is a testament to Amazon's strong brand equity and its ability to attract and retain customers. The brand's value is further reinforced by its diversified business model, which includes retail, AWS, and advertising services, each contributing to a robust revenue stream and providing a hedge against market volatility.\nTechnological Innovation: Amazon's commitment to innovation is evident in its strategic investments in technology and infrastructure, which are crucial for maintaining its competitive edge. The company's technology and infrastructure costs reflect significant investments in AWS and other Amazon businesses, ensuring a wide variety of products and services for customers. These investments are not only geared towards current needs but also lay the groundwork for future growth areas such as global broadband services and autonomous vehicles.\nFinancial Health: Amazon's financial health remains strong, with a substantial increase in net income from $9.879 billion in Q3 2023 to $15.328 billion in Q3 2024. The company's ability to generate higher earnings and maintain a solid balance sheet provides it with the financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, invest in new technologies, and navigate economic uncertainties.\nStory Continues\nWeaknesses\nInternational Tax Challenges: Amazon faces ongoing tax disputes in multiple jurisdictions, including the U.S., China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. These disputes could lead to significant tax liabilities and impact the company's financial results. For instance, the Luxembourg tax authority's denial of the tax basis for certain intangible assets could result in substantial tax payments, although Amazon intends to defend its position vigorously.\nDependency on North American Markets: While Amazon has a global presence, its financials reveal a heavy reliance on North American markets, which could expose the company to regional economic downturns or market saturation. Diversifying its revenue streams and reducing dependency on any single market is crucial for long-term stability and growth.\nCompetitive Pressures: Amazon operates in highly competitive markets, facing challenges from established retailers, emerging e-commerce platforms, and other tech giants. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market position, which requires significant investments and may pressure profit margins.\nOpportunities\nExpansion of AWS and Cloud Services: AWS continues to be a significant growth driver for Amazon, with increasing demand for cloud services across various industries. The company's ongoing investments in infrastructure and technology position AWS to capture a larger market share in the rapidly expanding cloud computing sector.\nGrowth in Emerging Markets: Amazon has the opportunity to expand its retail and AWS operations in emerging markets, where e-commerce and cloud adoption are growing. By tailoring its offerings to local needs and navigating regulatory environments, Amazon can tap into new customer segments and drive international growth.\nAdvancements in AI and Machine Learning: Amazon's expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning presents opportunities for product innovation and service enhancement. These technologies can improve customer experiences, streamline operations, and create new revenue streams through advanced analytics and automation.\nThreats\nRegulatory and Legal Risks: Amazon faces regulatory scrutiny in various markets, which could result in restrictions, fines, or changes to its business practices. The evolving regulatory landscape, particularly concerning data privacy, antitrust, and labor laws, poses a threat to Amazon's operational freedom and profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rate changes, and geopolitical developments can impact consumer spending and Amazon's cost structure. The company must navigate these uncertainties while maintaining its growth trajectory and managing expenses.\nSupply Chain Disruptions: Amazon's vast logistics network is susceptible to disruptions from global events, such as pandemics or trade conflicts. Ensuring supply chain resilience is critical to avoid interruptions in service and maintain customer satisfaction.\nIn conclusion, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) exhibits formidable strengths, including market leadership, technological prowess, and financial robustness, which are foundational to its success. However, it must address weaknesses such as\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) stock is up 79% over the past 12 months and trading at a premium valuation. Does the streaming giant have another leg higher, or is the rally running out of steam? With the stock up significantly and shares trading at 38 times analysts\u2019 December 2024 earnings estimates, it might seem that shares are running out of juice. However, the company has a secret weapon that it is ready to launch this month and expand as we head into 2025 \u2013 a new in-house ad server.\nI\u2019m bullish on Netflix because of its new in-house ad server, which should allow the company to capitalize on its growing ad-supported tier and make it a more valuable partner for advertisers, unlocking the next phase of the company\u2019s growth.\nAd-Supported Memberships Are Growing\nThings are going well for Netflix. The $324.6 billion company reported strong third-quarter results, growing revenue 15% year-over-year. Meanwhile, it increased operating income by a scorching 52% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, and its operating margin was 30%, up from 22% last year. In addition, ad-supported memberships are becoming a bigger part of the company\u2019s business, as they grew a remarkable 35% quarter-over-quarter.\nAnd Netflix\u2019s new secret weapon is poised to make this ad-supported tier even more lucrative for the company in the months ahead. Netflix\u2019s new ad server will launch in Canada this month and then in additional markets in 2025. Netflix previously relied on Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) ad server, but its new ad server will take advantage of partnerships with Google Live and Trade Desk (TTD).\nWhat Is an Ad Server?\nWhat is an ad server, and why is this important for Netflix? According to Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS), ad servers are \u201cthe technology engines that allow advertisers and publishers to optimize, manage, and distribute ads across a multitude of paid channels,\u201d such as Netflix and YouTube. Netflix\u2019s ad server will allow it to sell advertising slots to potential advertisers who want to advertise to viewers watching Netflix content.\nDigital ads like these are quite valuable to advertisers because they are more targeted and tailored to the specific viewer than traditional broadcast ads. Netflix is very close to the end user and their data, so based on the user\u2019s viewing habits and other data, Netflix\u2019s server may know that they like golf and can serve them ads for new golf clubs or golf apparel, which are more relevant to them than a broader ad for something they are not interested in.\nAs you can imagine, these narrowly-targeted, data-driven ads are also more valuable to the advertisers themselves.\nStory Continues\n\u201cEpisodic\u201d Ads that Tell a Story\nNetflix has also talked about the idea of serving customers \u201cepisodic\u201d ads that tell a story within themselves, which could help to attract attention and maintain interest from viewers. Co-CEO and President Ted Sarandos says that the ad server is a \u201ckey server in unlocking value\u201d in the ad-supported market and that \u201cwhile we\u2019ve got lots of work to do, we are very confident in our ability to execute and grow our ad business much like we did with the paid sharing initiative.\u201d\nUltimately, the proprietary ad server will empower Netflix to deliver more targeted, more valuable ads to its growing number of ad-tier subscribers around the world, powering the next leg up in the company\u2019s growth.\nNetflix\u2019s Valuation\nAs discussed above, Netflix trades at a premium valuation of 38.1 times earnings, but with analysts projecting earnings per share to grow to $23.79 for Fiscal 2025, the company trades at a slightly more inviting valuation of 31.8 times forward earnings, getting a bit closer to the S&P 500\u2019s (SPX) average valuation of 25 times earnings.\nAs the company continues to grow its ad-supported tier and better monetize this segment thanks to its in-house ad server, earnings should continue to grow over time and make this valuation more palatable.\nIs NFLX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nTurning to Wall Street, NFLX earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, 10 Holds, and two Sells assigned in the past three months. The average NFLX stock price target of $786.34 implies 4% upside potential from current levels.\nSee more NFLX analyst ratings\nSmart Score\nWhile Wall Street analysts view Netflix as a Moderate Buy, TipRanks\u2019 proprietary Smart Score system is decidedly bullish. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Netflix boasts an impressive Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 9 out of 10.\nLooking Ahead\nNetflix has been a great growth story for a long time and has gained nearly 80% over the past 12 months. However, the company could still have ample room for growth ahead as it debuts its new ad server in Canada this month and then rolls it out to a larger number of markets in 2025. I\u2019m bullish on Netflix based on the development and rollout of this valuable tool that Sarandos called the \u201ckey to unlocking value\u201d in the ad market.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "It's no secret the overall media and entertainment industry has struggled in recent years, burdened by labor strikes, profitability challenges, and a transition to streaming that's upended some of the most well-known corporate behemoths.\nOne company, though, has thrived amid the various changes: Netflix (NFLX).\nThe streaming platform beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs. The stock is up more than 50% since the start of the year.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCompared to other players, Netflix's subscriber count and profitability stand out.\nThe streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%.\nAnd in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close.\nDisney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks.\n\"Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,\" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance.\nOther analysts have piled onto that thinking, declaring the infamous streaming wars officially over.\n\"Netflix won the streaming wars,\" MoffettNathanson, one of the leading equity research firms for the tech and media sector, said in a note penned by analyst Robert Fishman last week. \"The media space right now is defined by a dichotomy in which Netflix stands as a lone exception.\"\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan agreed, recently telling Yahoo Finance's Market Domination that the company has \"undoubtedly\" secured its No. 1 position.\nHow we got here\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and, most importantly, subscribers.\nThe goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\nStory Continues\nAt the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. \"Bridgerton\" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.\nOthers soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for \"The Office\" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time.\nNetflix CEO Ted Sarandos (C) poses with cast and crew as they arrive for Netflix's \"Bridgerton Season 3\" premiere at Alice Tully Hall on May 13, 2024, in New York City. (ANDREA RENAULT / AFP) \u00b7 ANDREA RENAULT via Getty Images\nBut investors quickly realized that streaming is a tough business. It's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. Case in point: the profit struggles at Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount, among others.\nNetflix, viewed by even its competitors as \"the gold standard\" in streaming, has consistently had the upper hand due to its first-mover advantage as a pure-play streaming company. Its innovative approach to monetization, which includes controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, has also helped boost its positioning.\nAs the market stands today, Netflix's total enterprise value is now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined. It's viewed as a growth stock on Wall Street with full-year revenue expected to climb over 15% year over year.\nAnd as the chart below shows, Netflix's estimated enterprise multiple, which is a ratio used to determine the value of a company after taking into account debt and cash levels, in addition to stock price and cash profitability, comes second only to tech giant Apple. Not too shabby for a pure-play streaming player.\nCatching up to Netflix\nFishman argued in his note that a handful of key assets will be needed for streaming players to not only catch up to Netflix but to survive the industry's massive transition.\nThis includes a scaled streaming service (both in the US and globally), a free advertising video-on-demand (AVOD) platform, top-tier sports rights, a US broadcast network, and film and television studios.\nNot every company will need each one of these assets. But having any can boost a company's respective position within the industry.\nTake Disney (DIS), for example. The media conglomerate checks off every box except a free AVOD platform. But having a scaled streaming service in the US and abroad, like Netflix has, appears to be the formula to success \u2014 at least in the current moment.\n\"That really is, it seems, the end goal,\" Fishman said. \"Whether a company wants that for its own sake (all the traditional players) or to augment sales of toilet paper or cellphones [like Amazon], that is the goal.\"\nThat means joint ventures and other deals like acquisitions will be likely outcomes heading into the back half of the decade.\nParamount (PARA) has already agreed to merge with Skydance Media in a deal that's set to mark an end to the Redstone family's control of the company. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025.\nRegulatory challenges could be an overhang, however. A judge temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), citing antitrust concerns.\nThe Big Tech giants would face similar dealmaking hurdles given their size, while media companies combining with each other would pose their own risk, as nearly all of the top players carry heavy debt loads.\nIn his report, Fishman said Fox and WBD have the most complementary assets for a possible combination, especially since WBD lacks the NFL and most recently lost the NBA. The company is currently tied up in litigation after suing the NBA over the loss of those media rights.\nNetflix has won the streaming wars, but where does that leave everyone else? (Getty Images) \u00b7 SimpleImages via Getty Images\nTo that point, sports has emerged as the final frontier of streaming amid a dying cable TV business. But professional leagues have also been hesitant to fully abandon traditional television.\nThat gives the upper hand to companies with a broadcast network like Fox, Comcast and Disney, in Fishman's view.\n\"While leagues are also increasingly comfortable partnering with streamers, as the NFL Thursday Night Football transition from Fox to Amazon showed, doing so still presents a tradeoff in viewership,\" Fishman pointed out. \"Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners.\"\nAnd as new data shows, companies with exposure to both traditional television and streaming typically capture the most eyeballs.\nDisney's traditional broadcast and streaming properties accounted for a combined 11.3% of overall TV viewing time during the month of September, according to the latest Gauge report from Nielsen.\nGoogle's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Netflix rounded out the top five at 10.6%, 9.3%, 8.2%, and 7.9%, respectively.\nLooking ahead, \"Disney has the right asset mix to establish a true second global streaming service after Netflix,\" Fishman predicted. Disney, which is in the midst of finding its next CEO with Bob Iger's contract set to expire at the end of 2026, will report quarterly earnings on Nov. 14.\nBut he warned the rest of traditional media companies like Comcast, Paramount, and Warner Bros. \"still need to quickly determine which path to take in order to better position themselves within the great streaming game\" \u2014 whether that means a merger, asset sale, acquisition, partnership, or something else altogether.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this internet video service have returned +7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has gained 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nNetflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +99.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.2%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has changed +3.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Roku (ROKU) stock fell more than 17% on Thursday after the company's fourth quarter guidance disappointed, despite the media player reporting its first quarter of $1 billion in revenue.\nFor the current quarter, the company estimated gross profit to hit $465 million, with adjusted EBITDA expected at $30 million. Both metrics fell below Wall Street expectations of $477 million in gross profit and $36.2 million in adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022 USD\n(ROKU)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe company also said it will stop reporting streaming households as a key performance metric, echoing a similar move from streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), which will no longer report subscriber figures at the start of next year.\nInstead, Roku said it will focus on streaming hours, platform revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n\"Since our IPO in 2017, the streaming industry has evolved meaningfully, with Americans now spending significantly more TV time streaming than watching cable,\" Roku said in its earnings release. \"Our business has also grown and evolved, and we are now primarily focused on growing platform revenue and profitability.\"\nPrior to Wednesday's release, shares had rallied more than 30% over the past three months on expectations of a strong ad market and upside to platform revenue growth.\nIt's a critical shift for the company, which underwent a number of cost-cutting measures last year in an effort to bring down operating expenses and improve profits. Roku has recently committed to various monetization initiatives, which have included a deeper integration with programmatic advertising giant the Trade Desk (TTD).\nRoku said those efforts, along with tailwinds from political ad spend, will \"continue in Q4.\"\nA Roku logo is seen on a screen with a silhouette of a hand holding a tv remote. (Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) \u00b7 SOPA Images via Getty Images\nIn the third quarter, Roku reported net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 16% year over year, with a net loss of $65 million, or $0.06 a share. That quarterly net loss was significantly narrower than the $0.33 loss Wall Street expected, as well as the prior-year period's $2.33 quarterly loss.\nPlatform revenue, which includes ad sales, revenue from distribution deals, and the over-the-top streaming service, the Roku Channel, came in at $908 million, up 15% on the year.\nThe boom was driven by strength in advertising sales, content distribution, and expansion into international markets.\n\"In Q3, the year-over-year growth of advertising activities across the Roku platform \u2014 excluding media and entertainment \u2014 outperformed both the overall ad market and the over-the-top (OTT) ad market in the US,\" Roku said, highlighting strength in political, retail, and consumer packaged goods ad verticals.\nStory Continues\nThe company reported 85.5 million streaming households, a sequential increase of 2 million and up 13% year over year. Streaming hours also increased 5.3 billion year over year to reach 32 billion in the quarter.\nOverall, the company has been facing more competition in the connected TV and streaming ads business.\nAmazon (AMZN) rolled out ads on its Prime Video streaming service earlier this year in the US. Wall Street has noted the massive disruption the tech giant has already caused in the space as companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) are also in the running for ad buyers.\nOn Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne reiterated his Underweight rating on shares, categorizing recent optimism as \"premature\" and rising competition \"as an under-appreciated risk.\"\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

AOUT, Crocs, Inc. CROX, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Mattel, Inc. MAT.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n5 Discretionary Stocks to Buy as Consumer Confidence Hits 9-Month High\nU.S. consumers are much more confident now than they were last month. A jumbo rate cut announced last month by the Federal Reserve, coupled with optimism surrounding more interest rate cuts in the coming months, have made consumers confident about the economy's health.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in discretionary stocks such as American Outdoor Brands, Inc., Crocs, Inc., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Netflix, Inc. and Mattel, Inc.. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nConsumer Confidence Soars\nThe Conference Board said on Tuesday that the consumer confidence index surged to 108.7 in October, from 99.2 in the previous month, to hit its highest level in nine months.\nThe Present Situation Index, a measure of consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, jumped 14.2 points to reach 138. The Expectations Index, a measure of consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market situation, rose 6.3 points to 89.1. This was comfortably above the threshold of 80. Any reading below 80 indicates impending recession.\nThe jump in consumer confidence comes after ebbing drastically in September on fears of a slowing economy. Interestingly, consumer confidence remained high in October despite data suggesting a cooling job market.\nThe Labor Department said on Tuesday that job openings fell to a three-and-a-half-year low in September. Despite the decline, the Conference Board's survey showed that consumers' perceptions of the jobs market improved in October, which boosted their confidence.\nMore Rate Cut Hopes Boost Consumer Confidence\nFears gripped markets earlier this month after fresh data showed a slight uptick in monthly inflation in September. This raised concerns over the economy's health, turning markets volatile.\nHowever, consumers are hoping that inflation will still be on track to reach the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first rate cut since March 2020.\nStory Continues\nThe Federal Reserve has also hinted that more rate cuts are on the horizon if inflation continues to ease substantially. The CME FedWatch tool presently shows a 98.9% possibility of a 25-basis point cut in November and a 76.6% probability of a 20-basis point cut in December.

If that holds in trading Thursday, it will be the biggest one-day loss since a 24% decline on Feb. 16, when the company issued a lower-than-expected forecast.\nThe decision to withhold the data follows a similar one by Netflix Inc. in April, when the company announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers.\n\u201cBeginning with our Q1 2025 earnings results, we will no longer report quarterly updates on streaming households,\u201d the company said in a statement.

          "whole_article": "Back in 2002, Martha Stewart made headlines for aggressively chopping a cabbage in an effort to avoid speaking of insider-trading allegations. \u201cI want to focus on my salad,\u201d she said through tight lips. Fast-forward more than a decade later and Stewart is still trying to change the focus to more flattering aspects of her life. Or in other words, focus on her salad.\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Stewart apparently spent around 30 minutes complaining about Martha, the Netflix documentary made about her. Calling the second part of the movie \u201ca bit lazy,\u201d Stewart took issue with the way director R.J. Cutler portrayed her.\n\u201cThose last scenes with me looking like a lonely old lady walking hunched over in the garden? Boy, I told him to get rid of those. And he refused. I hate those last scenes. Hate them,\u201d she told the Times, adding that she was limping because she had just had an operation on her Achilles tendon, a detail that the director omitted to her chagrin.\nIndeed, Stewart might have the titular role in said Martha, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s finding herself in all that flattering of a biopic. She said that despite her having three cameras on her, the director would choose \u201cto use the ugliest angle\u201d and ignore her protests to use other ones.\nThe soundtrack was not spared criticism, as Stewart called out the usage of \u201csome lousy classical score,\u201d instead of using mostly rap, which she had deemed an \u201cessential part of the film.\u201d She had suggested that her friend Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre score the film.\nExpressing dismay that some of her more exciting stories were cut, her grandchildren weren\u2019t mentioned, and the allure of her magazines wasn\u2019t touched upon, Stewart expressed her annoyance that her prison sentence got so much attention.\nStewart spent five months, from October 2004 to March 2005, in a minimum-security prison for charges related to insider trading. \u201cI had to go through that to be a trophy for these idiots in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office,\u201d she said in the Netflix documentary, claiming that she was a target because of her title as the first self-made billionaire woman in America.\nShe said of prison that it was \u201cnot a good experience and it doesn't make you stronger\u201d to Katie Couric in 2017. Stewart has since made her comeback, and it appears she doesn\u2019t want to linger on that dip too much.\n\u201cIt was not that important,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cThe trial and the actual incarceration was less than two years out of an 83-year life. I considered it a vacation, to tell you the truth,\u201d she said, adding that the trial was so dull that the judge fell asleep.\nStory Continues\nIndeed, it seems as if over time, Stewart has changed her take on her sentence a bit. In Martha, she calls her daytime show a venture that \u201cmissed the point of Martha Stewart. A live audience, crummy music, that was more like prison than being at Alderson.\"\nThat being said, Stewart praised the first part of the documentary to the Times. She noted that young women have told her that watching the film \u201cgave them a strength they didn\u2019t know they had.\u201d And that was the point of the project.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted the documentary to be. It shouldn\u2019t be me boasting about inner strength and any of that crap. It should be about showing that you can get through life and still be yourself,\u201d she concluded.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

However, cost is not the biggest factor for consumers while they stream. As of today, the price of streaming services doesn\u2019t affect loyalty to an entertainment provider as it did in the past. Amdocs\u2019 \u201cThe New Streamer 2024\u201d report revealed that consumers are expecting improved experiences with rising costs. According to consumers, original content is the top feature that makes a subscription worthy. Other leading factors include access to older titles, new content every few weeks, and being able to watch anywhere.\nTrends Shaping the Streaming Industry\nForbes reported that streamers have been victims of long-term challenges related to profitability and subscriber growth. To counter these issues while catering to evolving consumer demands, streamers are opting for ad-supported plans. With almost half of the younger generation open to seeing more ads, this is a potential way to boost revenue.\nStreamers are also trying to score exclusive agreements and partnerships with sports leagues as live sports has become a hot commodity in streaming. Simultaneously, the cost of original content comes at reduced profitability. Against this, the potential solution is a consolidation of streaming platforms to allow access to deeper libraries of content for consumers without compromising on their priority of having original content on their plate. Additionally, cloud gaming is being integrated into streaming services considering 70% of Gen Z appears to be interested in it.\nOn October 18, Ben Silverman, Propagate Content Chairman & Co-CEO, appeared on CNBC giving examples of the aforementioned streaming industry trends. Commenting on the robust Q3 earnings for streaming giant Netflix, he said that its success would lead to more consolidation among the traditional media players in the smaller streamer space. The company is increasingly investing in original content, sports content, and gaming, something that will continue to reward the company as it expands its profits as well as businesses. While it has the money from its streaming business to make those investments back into streaming, many players in the streaming space do not have the same capabilities. Comcast also has the ability to sell a lot of WiFi and has many other businesses that can drive investment in the content business. He mentioned the telecommunications and media firm\u2019s acquisition of NBCUniversal becoming an engine for the whole company. In the views of Silverman, more troubled are the companies that are pure-play so they need to either consolidate to get to scale or be acquired by the bigger players in the future.\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, Silverman emphasized how sports acquisitions are the key drivers to advertising and not just the drivers in the ability to scale an audience at once. For instance, The streaming giant will be live-streaming two of the 2024 season\u2019s NFL games on Christmas Day. Previously in July, NBCUniversal and the NBA announced an 11-year agreement for NBC, Peacock, USA Network, Sky Sports, and Telemundo to present NBA and WNBA regular-season and playoff games starting in the 2025-26 season.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in, we sifted through ETFs, the Yahoo Finance stock screener, the Finviz stock screener, and online rankings to create an initial list of stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 7 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNetflix, Inc. (NFLX)'s Financial Growth and Future Advertising Ventures\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNumber of Hedge Fun Holders:\u00a0103\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming entertainment service with 283 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries enjoying TV series, films, and games across various genres and languages. Netflix started its journey in 1997 as a DVD-rental-by-mail firm and began streaming in the US in 2007 and internationally in 2010 while it became global in 2016.\nWith streaming entertainment replacing the linear TV experience potentially for an enduring period, Netflix expects to be one of the leading firms of the streaming entertainment era. The firm has been at a scale where it can economically create original content for Netflix since 2013 thereby reaping the benefits of originals. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a major advantage over its linear competitors as its shows don\u2019t compete for scarce prime-time slots like on linear TV. Furthermore, the reach is vast with Netflix being virtually everywhere except for Russia and China.\nIn the third quarter, revenue grew 15% year-over-year. The firm delivered multiple hits in the quarter including The Perfect Couple, Nobody Wants This, Emily in Paris, and CobraKai. Engagement remains strong with view hours per member amongst owner households increasing year-over-year through the first three quarters of 2024. Netflix is simultaneously improving its advertising business, with ads membership up 35% quarter-on-quarter and ad-tech platform set to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025.\nNetflix is well-positioned to bring engaging stories from many cultures to people globally with its global distribution. The firm is all set to benefit from the universal appeal for high-quality storytelling that transcends borders amidst the growing ubiquity of the internet. The firm remains excited about its Q4 slate including Squid Game S2, the Jake Paul/Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. With a steady drumbeat of hit titles from countries globally, healthy member engagement, and a large strong core business, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is poised for growth.\nOverall, NFLX ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of best streaming and TV stocks to invest in.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

Last week, the Tesla stock jumped about 23% primarily due to margin improvement and an upbeat outlook (read: Tesla Records its Best Day in 11 Years: 5 ETF Winners).\nDespite this surge, Wall Street remains divided over Tesla's place in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d \u2014 a group of market-dominating tech giants, including NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Microsoft MSFT and Tesla (read: Is Tesla's Stock Pop Sustainable? TSLA ETFs in Focus).\nAs the third-quarter earnings season kicks off, the Magnificent Seven is anticipated to record 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth, with NVIDIA, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta among the top contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, per FactSet, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nTesla\u2019s Earnings Rebound Yet Leave Analysts Skeptical\nTesla\u2019s third-quarter profits showed a 17% jump, a meaningful rebound after two quarters of decline. However, analysts remain cautious about Tesla\u2019s long-term position among Big Tech, citing concerns that its fundamentals may be overhyped.\nWe would like to note that Tesla\u2019s delivery numbers fell short of estimates in the past. Tesla has been losing market share to its rivals in both China and the United States, resulting in a notable slowdown in growth. This month itself we have seen Tesla\u2019s unimpressive robotaxi event, which failed to meet expectations, raising concerns among ridesharing investors.\nValuation Concerns Add to Tesla\u2019s Strained Standing\nTesla\u2019s pricey valuation further complicates its status within the Magnificent Seven. Although higher growth tends to demand a higher valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 115.54, Tesla\u2019s valuation far exceeds its tech peers.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalyst sentiment reflects this caution. Tesla currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.96 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 2.89 a month ago based on 38 recommendations.\nOf the 39 recommendations deriving the current ABR, Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 23.08% and 5.13%. It is the lowest approval rate within the Magnificent Seven.\nTesla\u2019s Stock Price Target\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 35 analysts, the average price target for Tesla comes to $206.22. The forecasts range from a low of $24.86 to a high of $310.00. The average price target represents a decline of 23.4% from the last closing price of $269.19 as on Oct. 25.\nStory Continues\nCould Netflix be a More Suitable Candidate?\nAs Tesla\u2019s standing falters, streaming giant Netflix NFLX has emerged as a possible replacement, thanks to its strong earnings, subscriber growth, improving free cash flow and solid guidance. Year to date, Netflix stock has surged by 55%, trailing only NVIDIA and Meta among the Magnificent Seven.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWealth Enhancement Group\u2019s Ayako Yoshioka believes Netflix is an appealing alternative due to its strong earnings and solid guidance. Bank of America loves its free cash flow strength, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Same is the view of Portfolio Wealth Advisors\u2019 Jesus Alvarado-Martinez.\nWith free cash flow reaching $2.19 billion in Q3, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier, Netflix\u2019s cash flow has been rising steadily since the pandemic. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich projects Netflix\u2019s free cash flow to hit $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026.\nBroker Rating on Netflix Stock\nOf the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR of Netflix shares, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.5% and 5% of all recommendations. The Netflix stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has an upbeat VGM Score of B. Netflix shares trade at a forward P/E of 37.88X versus 105.6X forward P/E possessed by the underlying Broadcast Radio and Television.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNetflix-Heavy ETFs in Focus\nInvestors who believe that Netflix shares deserve a spot in the tech elite club may play the stock in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) form, too. Netflix-heavy ETFs includesingle-stock funds like T-Rex 2X Long NFLX Daily Target ETF NFLU and Direxion Daily NFLX Bull 2X Shares NFXL.\nOther Netflix-heavy ETFs include MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS (Netflix has a 9.18% weight), Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF GGME (NFLX stock has an 8.35% weight) and First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN (NFLX shares have an 8.32% weight).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks to buy before they split next.\nS&P 500: Targeting 6,000 Amid Market Optimism\nThere\u2019s been a notable sense of fear among investors despite the market\u2019s current strong performance. The upcoming weeks are expected to be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and an impending election, alongside uncertainty regarding the Fed\u2019s next moves. But the fact remains that the market has shown resilience, with numerous new highs for major indices this year, although investors remain skeptical. Historically, volatility tends to increase after elections as political changes take effect. Currently, volatility is relatively low but is anticipated to rise as January approaches and clarity about potential policy impacts emerges.\nDespite prevailing uncertainties, there remains cautious optimism about the market\u2019s ability to maintain its upward trajectory. In mid-October, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC to the skepticism displayed by investors. We covered his sentiment in our article about the\u00a08 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now:\n\u201cKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents\u2019 experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\nAround the same time, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss the market trends as well. On October 14, Mary Ann Bartels highlighted that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, she acknowledged that while this target is achievable, the journey may not be smooth.\nStory Continues\nBartels noted that there could be volatility ahead, as evidenced by increased hedging activity in the market. However, she remains optimistic due to the Fed\u2019s shift towards an easier monetary policy and the ongoing economic growth, which is supported by full employment, albeit with a slight slowdown in job creation. Importantly, she highlighted that corporate profits are on the rise, with earnings currently beating expectations by about 5%. This positive trend across fundamental and technical indicators leads her to believe that the market can continue its rally into November and December.\nAs the S&P 500 recently closed above 5,800 for the first time at 5,815, Bartels discussed how this milestone brings the 6,000 target closer. She echoed sentiments from Tom Lee, who suggested that market behavior could improve significantly if there is clarity regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Bartels agreed that once a winner is declared, it could trigger a relief rally as both domestic and foreign investors gain confidence in the stability of US leadership.\nTurning to the Fed\u2019s actions, Bartels addressed concerns about recent CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected. She described potential short-term volatility as a bucking bull, indicating that while fluctuations might occur, the overall trend remains upward. Her year-ahead thesis suggests both fixed-income and equity markets are poised for positive returns, albeit with some bumps along the way.\nBartels also advocated for buying opportunities in the current market environment. She specifically pointed to technology stocks and the NASDAQ, which has yet to hit a new record high. She believes technology will continue to lead the market, particularly emphasizing semiconductors as key drivers of growth. For investors looking to enter the tech sector, she sees this as an opportune moment.\nHer perspective underscores a belief in the resilience of corporate profits and economic fundamentals amid changing monetary policies and external uncertainties. At the same time, it should be noted that the optimistic outlook for the S&P 500 targeting 6,000 is significant for stock splits as it reflects positive market sentiment, encouraging companies to make their shares more accessible to retail investors. When share prices rise, splits can attract more buyers by lowering the price per share. However, it\u2019s important to note that a stock split does not change anything about a business\u2019s fundamentals. A poor company will stay a poor company post-split and a good company will stay a good company.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of stocks that are likely to split. We then selected the 20 stocks that have experienced the highest gains in their share prices over the past 5 years and have a history of spitting their stock. From that, we picked the top 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Netflix Inc. (NFLX) a Top Stock to Buy Before the Next Split?\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nShare Price as of October 18: $689.66\nSurge in Share Price in 5 Years: 150.51%\nStock Split Confirmed: no\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming service provider that offers TV shows, movies, documentaries, and original content. Founded in 1997 as a DVD rental service, it transitioned to a streaming platform in 2007. It has revolutionized the way people consume entertainment and is considered a pioneer in the streaming industry.\nThe company has introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier powered by AI in late 2022 to enhance user experience and deliver more effective ads. As a pioneer in online streaming, it\u2019s a top-performing stock. Its massive and growing subscriber base drives significant revenue growth. In 2023, it achieved record UK revenues, primarily due to increased subscriber numbers following its crackdown on password sharing.\nRevenue was up by 15.02% year-over-year in Q3 2024. Despite challenges in membership growth and ad monetization, it added over 5 million new subscribers and improved its operating margin to 29.6%. International markets drove subscriber growth, and the ad-supported tier saw a 35% quarter-on-quarter increase in memberships. The company\u2019s strategic shift towards advertising has solidified its position as a strong investment.\nManagement announced that the company\u2019s first-party ad server is launching in Canada this quarter and will expand to other markets in 2025. Partnerships with Trade Desk and Google Live are progressing well. There are plans for more ad formats, features, and measurement tools.\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) projects a 14.7% increase in revenue year-over-year for Q4, with a target operating margin of 21.6%. Looking ahead to 2025, it anticipates annual revenue between $43 billion and $44 billion, driven by continued subscriber growth and higher average revenue per subscriber. The international expansion and ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences position it for continued growth.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFinally, we trimmed\u00a0Netflix, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:NFLX) mostly due to valuation but also as a source of funds to add to the new position in Shopify. As a reminder, we added to our position in August 2022 amid broad concerns about the company\u2019s ability to grow and monetize shared passwords. We expected Netflix to show progress in monetizing shared passwords, leading to robust free cash flow generation. This is now playing out and is appreciated by the market. Hence, given the balance of growth and valuation, we felt it was appropriate to reduce our exposure to a more normal weight.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 2nd on our list of stocks to buy before they split next. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NFLX, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Research has found this method of analysis is more predictive than looking at earnings per share.\nAn economic profit analysis assembled at Fortune\u2019s request by Institutional Shareholder Services\u2019 ISS EVA shows that Nvidia is every bit the superstar it appears to be. You don\u2019t have to be a finance wonk to understand these numbers: Nvidia\u2019s return on capital over the past four quarters is 140%, while its cost of capital is 9.3%. \u201cStaggering,\u201d says Bennett Stewart, one of the pioneers of economic profit analysis. \u201cIt's hard to fathom how they could get a return on capital much higher than that.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how astoundingly Nvidia makes money. ISS calculates EVA data for 21,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, and it reports that Nvidia is in the 100th percentile for profitability. That doesn\u2019t mean Nvidia is in the top percentile (which would be the 99th percentile). It means Nvidia ranks above every one of those other 21,000 companies, or possibly ties with some of them.\nBut those remarkable numbers reflect the past, and stock prices are based on the future. Thus the critical question for investors: What are the chances that Nvidia will perform well enough in future years to justify the stock\u2019s price, recently about $136? EVA can help answer that question.\nWe asked ISS EVA to calculate how fast Nvidia would have to increase its economic profit annually over the next 20 years in order to justify its recent share price. The answer: 21.4%. Nvidia must increase its economic profit by 21.4% every year for 20 years. If it can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s recent stock price is too high.\nStory Continues\nSo can it do that? No one knows for sure, but here are some numbers for context.\n\u00b7 Nvidia\u2019s economic profit over the past four quarters was $46.2 billion. Its economic profit would have to have grown to $2.2 trillion for the 20th year alone to justify its recent stock price.\n\u00b7 The highest economic profit ever earned by any company in 12 months is $202.7 billion, achieved by Saudi Arabian Oil Co. in 2022.\n\u00b7 The highest economic profit ever earned by a tech company is Apple\u2019s $92.8 billion.\nAnd then there\u2019s a fact based not on math but on real-world experience: When numbers get really big, increasing them by large percentages every year becomes difficult and eventually impossible.\nThis isn\u2019t just theory. EVA analyses of this type\u2014showing a massive gap between a company\u2019s stock price and the operating performance necessary to achieve it\u2014have proved prescient.\nA Fortune analysis in 2023 found that Tesla stock was overpriced at $210. It declined to $138, though because the stock is highly volatile, we warned that it might jump above $210, which it has done (recently $247). Most Wall Street analysts expect it to decline, dropping further from its $414 peak.\nFortune in 2021 published an EVA analysis of Amazon\u2019s stock price showing that it was unreasonably high. Investors who bought at that price have regretted it. As we write this, the stock is exactly where it was\u2014$186\u2014when the analysis appeared more than three years ago.\nJust before the infamous AOL-Time Warner merger was announced in 2000, Fortune published an EVA analysis showing (correctly) that AOL stock was impossibly overvalued. The stock was the currency with which AOL bought Time Warner, and a following article concluded the deal had to be doomed\u2014as it proved to be.\nNvidia doesn\u2019t have a problem. It\u2019s performing spectacularly. But the recent buyers of the stock are taking a far greater risk than they may realize. They\u2019re betting Nvidia will continue performing spectacularly for 20 years. In theory, it\u2019s possible. In reality, betting that Taylor Swift and Shohei Ohtani will perform at the top of their game for the next 20 years might offer better odds.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Alphabet achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 27% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nearnings-per-share-growth\nWe know that Alphabet has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

Courtyards\nIs Denver\u2019s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off?\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nChicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow\nInstead, in many cases they were left wanting.\nWhile Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all topped analyst expectations for sales and profits last week, the results weren\u2019t strong enough to justify their lofty multiples relative to the broader market.\nWith few reasons to bid up the group, technology investors hit the sell button, resulting in a 1.8% drop in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, with only Alphabet and Amazon ending the week in the green. The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, weighed down by the big-tech group.\n\u201cInvestors had higher numbers in mind,\u201d said Michael Casper, equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThey\u2019re expecting more from AI and these AI projects than what they\u2019ve gotten so far.\u201d\nThe issue isn\u2019t the current quarter per se: the group of seven companies is on track to deliver profit growth of 30% in three-month period through September, which would beat the estimate of 18% at the start of earnings season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\nThe trouble is next year\u2019s profit outlook remains murky with the tech giants continuing to spend heavily on infrastructure to support more AI computing power. Analysts have been cutting their 2025 profit-growth projections for the Magnificent Seven cohort since earnings season began more than two weeks ago.\nHigher spending on artificial intelligence dominated Magnificent Seven earnings this season. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta pumped a record $59 billion into capital expenditures in the third quarter while pledging to spend significantly more next year.\n\u201cRight now you have a little bit of Silicon Valley arrogance that says, we just are going to spend, because we know better than you do,\u201d said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W Baird & Co.\nWhile there were signs that revenue from AI-related demand is picking up steam, the message from management teams was that investors will need to wait longer for the big payoffs to show up.\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI business is on track to exceed an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which would make it the fastest business in the company\u2019s history to reach that milestone, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said on the earnings call.\nStory Continues\nSignificant Costs\nHowever, those sales come with significant costs. Microsoft\u2019s commercial cloud margin will narrow in the current quarter as capital expenditures continue to ramp up, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said.\nThat didn\u2019t sit well with many investors when coupled with a forecast for slower quarterly cloud revenue growth. Microsoft shares tumbled 6.1% the day after its earnings, the biggest drop in two years. Combined with a disappointing revenue forecast from Meta Platforms, traders headed for the exits.\nAll told, technology, media and telecom stocks collectively saw the largest net selling in five weeks, according to Goldman Sachs prime brokerage report.\nRead: Big Tech Stocks Lose Some of Their Aura as Earnings Growth Slows\n\u201cAs long as these companies are going to keep spending like this, they have to back it up on the revenue side and the revenue bar is very high,\u201d BI\u2019s Casper said. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern for the next few quarters.\u201d\nThere were bright spots, of course. Amazon, which has been dogged by concerns about pressure on margins from big spending, soothed nerves when its forecast for operating profit for the current quarter exceeded expectations.\nSean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, came away from this week encouraged that AI-related sales growth is sufficient to justify the higher spending.\n\u201cFor many of these companies, growth is accelerating and margins are improving and that\u2019s what you want to see,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe AI winners will continue to perform.\u201d\nHowever, other questions hanging over the tech giants heading into earnings went unanswered.\nApple, whose shares have soared on optimism that new AI features will reinvigorate sluggish revenue growth, gave a sales forecast for the current quarter that fell short of the average analyst estimate.\nTo BI\u2019s Casper, this week\u2019s earnings did little to tarnish the relative attraction of cheaper S&P 500 sectors that have outperformed big-tech stocks since July.\n\u201cThe story is still that the rest of the S&P 500\u2019s growth rates are starting to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad story for tech by any stretch, but maybe some other groups get to have some fun now.\u201d\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nTrump\u2019s Immigration Policy Would Make Food Inflation Even Worse\nHow to End the Backlog of Asylum Cases?

          "whole_article": "ChatGPT has launched a search engine, breaking into the market that for decades has been dominated by\u2014and synonymous with\u2014Google.\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced \u201cChatGPT Search\u201d on Thursday. This version of the popular chatbot will let users get the latest information available on the internet.\nMany of the results to queries appear like those one would find on a standard Google search. For example, looking up \u201cChinese food\u201d yields a list of reviews for nearby restaurants, while a search for advice about a vacation to Costa Rica produces travel blogs and hotel listings. In addition, much of the focus is on the tool\u2019s ability to provide real-time information, just as a search engine does, for queries users want to know right away and which can change at a moment's notice\u2014sports scores, stock prices, and the weather.\nThe tool then summarizes that information and cites where it came from. To prepare for the launch, OpenAI secured several agreements with media companies like The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal, and Vox to allow for their content to be included in its search results.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1GvhS8fp94\nDuring a public Q&A on Reddit for the launch of ChatGPT Search, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman hailed it as an improvement on current search formats.\n\u201cFor many queries, I find it to be a way faster/easier way to get the information I'm looking for,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI think we'll see this especially for queries that require more complex research. I also look forward to a future where a search query can dynamically render a custom web page in response!\u201d\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said ChatGPT Search aims to simplify the process of searching for information online by using ChatGPT\u2019s natural language processing skills and providing users with access to reputable sources. Google did not respond to a request for comment.\nChatGPT Search uses other search engines on the backend to power its search results. One of those is Bing, the search engine run by Microsoft, which is one of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investors, OpenAI vice president of engineering Srinivas Narayanan said in a comment during the Reddit Q&A. OpenAI has not released the names of the other search engines it works with. The OpenAI spokesperson said ChatGPT Search will use a mix of search technologies to deliver its results.\nChatGPT is not the only company to try and rival Google with an AI-powered search engine. The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Perplexity bills itself as an AI search engine. (Fortune and Perplexity have a revenue-sharing agreement for revenue generated from search results that feature the publication\u2019s articles.) Google also uses its Gemini large language model for its own search results, to summarize content that would have ordinarily appeared within the links it lists as search results.\nStory Continues\nChatGPT has made some very marginal progress in chipping away at Google\u2019s roughly 91% market share of the search engine market. A survey of 1,300 people conducted in September by investment firm Evercore found that 8% of respondents chose ChatGPT over Google as their search engine of choice, an increase from 1% in June.\nWhile progress may be slow, and a single survey is not reflective of the entirety of the market trends shaping Google\u2019s $175 billion search advertising business, it is a rather notable development given that Google\u2019s position was dominant it became a verb. Google is such an immovable force that even an effort last February by Microsoft to use ChatGPT to enhance Bing\u2019s search results\u2014considered a major differentiating factor then\u2014resulted in less than one percentage point of market share gain. It now appears that Microsoft and OpenAI have reversed their strategy, using Bing to power ChatGPT rather than the reverse.\nDespite those tortoise-paced gains, Google still dwarfs its competitors. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, doesn\u2019t release exact numbers for its search queries but they are in the billions per month. Even without the specific figures, they are significantly higher than the amount of users ChatGPT and Perplexity have. In August, ChatGPT said it had 200 million weekly users, roughly 800 million a month. While Perplexity had 10 million monthly active users as of February, according to the New York Times, a number that is rather impressive for a startup but pales in comparison to Google\u2019s stature.\nNonetheless, the industry-wide sentiment in Silicon Valley is that AI will change the nature of search engines. How exactly that happens though remains to be seen, even by some of AI\u2019s major players like ChatGPT. When a Reddit user asked OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil about differences between AI-powered search and the old-school version, he said it was still early days.\n\u201cThe product just launched today so there's a lot to figure out still about where search will be similar and where it will be different in an AI world. Would love any feedback you have!,\u201d Weil wrote on Reddit.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Business communications software company 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT) will be reporting earnings tomorrow afternoon. Here\u2019s what to look for.\n8x8 met analysts\u2019 revenue expectations last quarter, reporting revenues of $178.1 million, down 2.8% year on year. It was a softer quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a miss of analysts\u2019 billings estimates.\nIs 8x8 a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting 8x8\u2019s revenue to decline 3.6% year on year to $178.3 million, a further deceleration from the 1.3% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.08 per share.\n8x8 Total Revenue\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. 8x8 has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates five times over the last two years.\nLooking at 8x8\u2019s peers in the productivity software segment, some have already reported their Q3 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Microsoft delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 16%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.6%, and ServiceNow reported revenues up 22.2%, topping estimates by 1.9%. Microsoft traded down 6.3% following the results while ServiceNow was up 5.4%.\nRead our full analysis of Microsoft\u2019s results here and ServiceNow\u2019s results here.\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the productivity software segment, with share prices up 6.4% on average over the last month. 8x8 is up 11.1% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $2.98 (compared to the current share price of $2.20).\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\nView Comments"

Courtyards\nIs Denver\u2019s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off?\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nChicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow\nInstead, in many cases they were left wanting.\nWhile Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all topped analyst expectations for sales and profits last week, the results weren\u2019t strong enough to justify their lofty multiples relative to the broader market.\nWith few reasons to bid up the group, technology investors hit the sell button, resulting in a 1.8% drop in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, with only Alphabet and Amazon ending the week in the green. The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, weighed down by the big-tech group.\n\u201cInvestors had higher numbers in mind,\u201d said Michael Casper, equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThey\u2019re expecting more from AI and these AI projects than what they\u2019ve gotten so far.\u201d\nThe issue isn\u2019t the current quarter per se: the group of seven companies is on track to deliver profit growth of 30% in three-month period through September, which would beat the estimate of 18% at the start of earnings season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\nThe trouble is next year\u2019s profit outlook remains murky with the tech giants continuing to spend heavily on infrastructure to support more AI computing power. Analysts have been cutting their 2025 profit-growth projections for the Magnificent Seven cohort since earnings season began more than two weeks ago.\nHigher spending on artificial intelligence dominated Magnificent Seven earnings this season. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta pumped a record $59 billion into capital expenditures in the third quarter while pledging to spend significantly more next year.\n\u201cRight now you have a little bit of Silicon Valley arrogance that says, we just are going to spend, because we know better than you do,\u201d said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W Baird & Co.\nWhile there were signs that revenue from AI-related demand is picking up steam, the message from management teams was that investors will need to wait longer for the big payoffs to show up.\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI business is on track to exceed an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which would make it the fastest business in the company\u2019s history to reach that milestone, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said on the earnings call.\nStory Continues\nSignificant Costs\nHowever, those sales come with significant costs. Microsoft\u2019s commercial cloud margin will narrow in the current quarter as capital expenditures continue to ramp up, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said.\nThat didn\u2019t sit well with many investors when coupled with a forecast for slower quarterly cloud revenue growth. Microsoft shares tumbled 6.1% the day after its earnings, the biggest drop in two years. Combined with a disappointing revenue forecast from Meta Platforms, traders headed for the exits.\nAll told, technology, media and telecom stocks collectively saw the largest net selling in five weeks, according to Goldman Sachs prime brokerage report.\nRead: Big Tech Stocks Lose Some of Their Aura as Earnings Growth Slows\n\u201cAs long as these companies are going to keep spending like this, they have to back it up on the revenue side and the revenue bar is very high,\u201d BI\u2019s Casper said. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern for the next few quarters.\u201d\nThere were bright spots, of course. Amazon, which has been dogged by concerns about pressure on margins from big spending, soothed nerves when its forecast for operating profit for the current quarter exceeded expectations.\nSean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, came away from this week encouraged that AI-related sales growth is sufficient to justify the higher spending.\n\u201cFor many of these companies, growth is accelerating and margins are improving and that\u2019s what you want to see,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe AI winners will continue to perform.\u201d\nHowever, other questions hanging over the tech giants heading into earnings went unanswered.\nApple, whose shares have soared on optimism that new AI features will reinvigorate sluggish revenue growth, gave a sales forecast for the current quarter that fell short of the average analyst estimate.\nTo BI\u2019s Casper, this week\u2019s earnings did little to tarnish the relative attraction of cheaper S&P 500 sectors that have outperformed big-tech stocks since July.\n\u201cThe story is still that the rest of the S&P 500\u2019s growth rates are starting to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad story for tech by any stretch, but maybe some other groups get to have some fun now.\u201d\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nTrump\u2019s Immigration Policy Would Make Food Inflation Even Worse\nHow to End the Backlog of Asylum Cases?

          "whole_article": "Of the six members of \u2018The Magnificent 7\u2019 group of stocks that have reported September-quarter results already, the market didn\u2019t like three \u2013 Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta META \u2013 but loved the Tesla TSLA report and liked what it saw from Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\nThe group ceded its market leadership role a few months back, and these mixed results can be interpreted to mean that the trend is now here to stay. In other words, the group\u2019s unambiguous market leadership of last year and early this year is now firmly behind us.\nI want to push back on part of this narrative, as most Mag 7 stocks provide some of the most sustainable growth performances in the entire market.\nAside from Apple, which is likely no longer a growth company, the other Mag 7 companies are not only generating impressive top- and bottom-line growth today, but the trend is expected to remain in place at least through next year, if not beyond.\nTake the case of Apple, which beat consensus estimates and whose Q3 earnings increased +8.8% from the year-earlier level to almost $25 billion on +6.1% higher revenues of nearly $95 billion. Apple may no longer command the growth pace of its peers like Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta, but it enjoys a degree of market dominance that is hard to dislodge by its competitors, let alone start-ups.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +10.7% on +16% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings increased +35.4% on +18.9% revenue growth. Both companies beat top- and bottom-line consensus estimates.\nIf one was nitpicking the results from these two companies, then signs of deceleration in Microsoft\u2019s cloud revenues and Meta\u2019s advertising revenues would be the only operating issues here. Is that the issue in the Microsoft and Meta reports, or is there something else at play?\nThe answer to that question lies in what Microsoft and Meta are doing to prepare for the artificial intelligence (AI) world. Each of them is heavily investing in building AI infrastructure, and the amounts involved are massive and bigger than\u00a0many in the markets had been expecting.\nIn fact, Microsoft and Meta are hardly alone in this boat, as Alphabet and Amazon are spending as heavily on AI infrastructure as these two.\nIn fact, Apple is the lone laggard in this regard, though it has started talking more about the AI capabilities embedded in its coming software upgrades that will require users to have the newest iPhones. However, we should remember\u00a0that unlike Apple, which is solely a consumer-facing operator whose AI functionalities will be targeted at consumers, the other Mag 7 players primarily target businesses with their AI offerings.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet and Amazon have been able to explain and show\u00a0the impact and contribution of AI spending level on its current and coming growth trajectory this earnings season. Microsoft and Meta didn\u2019t do a good job on that front.\nWe have no reason to think that these otherwise very well-run companies are throwing good money on questionable projects. As such, we like these companies investing in their future that will ensure their primacy and leadership status in the AI-centric future world. In other words, we think the market\u2019s capex fixation is overdone.\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period. The +30.5% earnings growth comprises actual results from the six group members that have reported and estimates for Nvidia (which reports on November 20th).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q3 earnings for the Technology sector are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +11.4% higher revenues. Please note that had it not been for the big hit that Intel took in Q3, earnings growth for the sector would be +30.5%.\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s growth picture on an annual basis.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks in the fore front of the rising estimates trend.\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nThrough Friday, November 1st, we have seen Q3 results from 350 S&P 500 members, or 70% of the index\u2019s total membership. With 104 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week, we will have seen Q3 results from more than 90% of the index\u2019s membership.\nTotal earnings for these 350 companies that have reported are up +8.8% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues, with 74.9% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 60.6% beating revenue estimates.\nThe proportion of these 350 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 50.3%.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. The first set of comparison charts show the earnings and revenue growth rates.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe second set of comparison charts compare the Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below spotlight the revenue performance and the blended beats percentage for this group of 350 index members.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the growth trend appears to be stable and positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter average for this group of companies, with the Q3 revenue beats percentage just a hair above the low point for the preceding 20-quarter period.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +6.8% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\nThe chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.\nHad it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +9.2% instead of +6.8%. Excluding the Tech sector\u2019s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be only +2% instead of +6.8%.\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +1.3% instead of +6.8%.\nFor the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues.\nUnlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better, as the chart below shows.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with the +7.5% earnings growth this year followed by double-digit gains in 2025 and 2026.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +7.5% earnings growth improves to +9.5% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Tech Flexes Earnings Power: A Closer Look\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN) stock closed 6% higher on Friday after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected.\nThe company said on Thursday that it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecast $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said operating income is expected to be between $16 billion and $20 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall Street had projected $17.49 billion.\nIn the third quarter, Amazon posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon's closely tracked Amazon Web Services unit tallied revenue of $27.45 billion in the quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street's projections.\n\"You've got the ingredients you needed for the stock to go up,\" Arun Sundaram, CFRA senior equity research analyst, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nSundaram pointed to Amazon's 11% operating margin, which came in above Wall Street's expectations of 9.34%, as another key driver of the stock's move higher after hours. Arun noted that Amazon is able to pull on other levers in its business, like its e-commerce unit or advertising, to help grow margins while it spends on AI.\nAmazon's earnings follow a volatile few trading sessions for Big Tech companies amid other earnings reports as artificial intelligence spending and how each company is managing it has been in particular focus. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines and posted impressive gains in its cloud and advertising segments, business lines that compete with Amazon.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft and Meta (META) had a tougher going. The stocks of both tech giants fell after their earnings Thursday, as investors were spooked by an increase in AI spending, despite both companies beating expectations after the bell on Wednesday.\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth in 2025. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend \"more than that\" in 2025. In 2023, Amazon's capital expenditures were $48.4 billion. Jassy said the increased spending is driven by generative AI, which he described as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\n\"The faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware,\" Jassy said on the earnings call when explaining why spending continues to grow. \"And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all that up front, in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources.\"\nStory Continues\nJassy added, \"I think, as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon's lucrative cloud business is expected to generate close to $28 billion in the third quarter as the company attracts more clients with new AI services.

Courtyards\nIs Denver\u2019s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off?\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nChicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow\nWillie Phillips, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said artificial intelligence and related technologies hold \u201cgenerational significance\u201d and belong in the US.\n\u201cWe have that opportunity today with regard to data centers, and we should not surrender it,\u201d Phillips said Friday at a highly anticipated FERC technical conference about building data centers next to power plants. \u201cData centers moving overseas due to a lack of power supply and infrastructure or regulatory barriers could cause lost opportunities for economic growth and raise national security concerns for our nation.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s meeting launches the first big discussion at FERC about how to serve data centers, which are poised to drive unprecedented growth in electricity demand. AI is evolving quickly, and the data centers being planned to support it use as much power as entire towns. But building new power plants and transmission lines takes years, and US grids are already under increasing stress from aging infrastructure, the rise of renewable resources and extreme storms.\nThe conference focused on the merits and pitfalls of building data centers next to power plants, often described as \u201cco-location.\u201d In March, Amazon Web Services paid Talen Energy Corp. $650 million for a data center campus adjacent to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. FERC is currently reviewing a complaint from utilities that the deal could lead to higher rates for their customers.\nCritics fear co-location will strain electricity supplies on the power grid and allow deep-pocketed tech giants to avoid paying for infrastructure upgrades, shunting those costs onto consumers. FERC Commissioner Mark Christie pointed to the threat of shortages by 2030 on the largest US grid \u2014 operated by PJM Interconnection \u2014 which covers such data center hot spots as Virginia and Ohio.\n\u201cWe want to serve data centers, absolutely, but we want to be fair to all the other consumers,\u201d Christie said.\nBut co-location would allow companies such as Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to open data centers at a faster pace. Executives from power generators Talen, Vistra Corp. and Constellation Energy Corp. told the conference that data centers can support existing plants and bring on new electricity supplies, noting Microsoft\u2019s recent deal to revive the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Dominion Energy Inc., said its Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut could conceivably be an option for co-location in the future, according to a statement filed to FERC.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have until 2030 to figure this out,\u201d Cole Muller, executive vice president of strategic ventures at Talen, said during the meeting. The rise in electricity demand is coming, and long-term contracts \u201censure the longevity of our power plants,\u201d he said.\n(Updates with more details and comments starting in paragraph five.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nTrump\u2019s Immigration Policy Would Make Food Inflation Even Worse\nHow to End the Backlog of Asylum Cases?

          "whole_article": "The quarterly results this week of Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) provided an AI-era playbook for making investors patiently wait for results on massive infrastructure spending.\nAlphabet dazzled Wall Street on Tuesday with earnings that beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong growth in its cloud business. The company posted profit and sales increases of 37% and 15%, respectively, compared to the year prior.\nEven as investors in recent months have expressed some impatience with the tech industry's enormous investments in AI technology, Google showed that a dominant performance of its core business can alleviate those concerns.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAmazon, too, offered a resounding earnings beat. The company posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. The stellar report helped offset lingering concerns about mounting capital expenditures.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call Thursday that \"as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\"\nAmazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and Jassy said the company plans to spend \"more than that\" in 2025.\nThe e-commerce giant's approach to selling AI spending was also helped by claims that new revenue has already arrived. While Amazon has not disclosed exact figures for AI-related sales, Jassy has said the AI business inside of its cloud unit has generated several billion dollars. And on Thursday he added that the business is growing at a \"triple-digit year-over-year percentage.\u201d\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy expects to spend even more money in 2025 on capital expenditures, driven by the development of AI technology. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut investors have not given all the big-spending tech companies the same leeway when it comes to ballooning capital expenditures.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) were met with a more unforgiving investor response this week, even as both tech giants beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings and revenue. Investors sent both stocks lower after their respective reports. Wall Street recoiled after executives of both companies said they expect capex to continue increasing in the quarters to come.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMeta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth next year and revised its expectation upward for 2024 capex. The uneasiness among investors harkens back to Facebook's prior spending spree, when Reality Labs lost more than $13 billion and shares in the company tanked 60% in 2022. Zuckerberg has since improved the company's financials and its standing on Wall Street, but he's also prompted a fresh round of jitters.\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's boosted AI spending came with its own troublesome news: The company said it expects slower growth in its cloud business, highlighting the risks of dedicating major resources to AI development without the returns to offset them.\nBoth Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have framed their spending on AI as worthwhile endeavors, helping to massage the worries of investing in a new technology with uncertain returns. Earlier this year Pichai addressed Wall Street's fears head on: \"The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.\u201d In his view, spending too much on AI is a small price to pay for claiming a leadership position in a future AI-dominated landscape.\nJassy offered a similar argument on Thursday, describing generative AI as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\nGoogle and Amazon investors appear to be taking them at their word.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Each company has invested heavily in AI, data storage, and innovative technologies to attract business clients and capture greater market share. Today, Amazon leads the group in cloud market share with 31% of the market, then Microsoft with 20% followed by Alphabet with 12%.\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, in the third quarter of 2024, spending on global cloud infrastructure services surged by $15.7 billion, or 23%, over the same period in 2023, reaching over $84 billion for the quarter ending September 30. Over the last year, revenue from cloud infrastructure services hit $313 billion, underscoring the intense competition in this sector. Despite its massive scale, the cloud market continues to expand rapidly, with year-over-year (YoY) growth accelerating for the fourth straight quarter.\nAll three of these stocks reported earnings this week, with the results of their cloud services segments under the microscope. Amazon and Alphabet had positive reactions to their earnings results, while Microsoft saw some selling following its meeting. All companies had very positive results though, beating sales and earnings estimates. Also notable, Amazon stock has outperformed the market year-to-date (YTD), while Alphabet is about in line with market performance and Microsoft below.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMZN, GOOGL and MSFT Earnings Revisions\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have each made significant strides in cloud computing, but their earnings revision trends and growth forecasts tell slightly different stories. Both Amazon and Microsoft currently hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a relatively flat earnings revision trend. On the other hand, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting a more favorable outlook driven by recent upward revisions to its earnings estimates.\nLooking at long-term earnings growth projections, Amazon stands out with an anticipated annual growth rate of 27.2% over the next three to five years led by AWS. Alphabet\u2019s expected growth rate of 17.6% per year reflects its continued growth in cloud services, YouTube and now self-driving with Waymo, while Microsoft, expected to grow at 14.7% annually, showcases steady gains in both its cloud and software offerings, including Azure and Office 365.\nTheir valuation also offers valuable insight into what investors can expect going forward. Today, Alphabet is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.4x which is below its 10-year median of 25.8x, Amazon at 38.4x is also below its 10-year median of 92.4x and Microsoft at 31.2x is above its 10-year median of 26.5x.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMZN, GOOGL or MSFT: Which Shares Should Investors Buy?\nFor investors seeking the best mix of growth potential and value, GOOGL and AMZN stand out as the most attractive choices among the cloud giants. Both companies not only boast strong earnings growth projections\u2014with Amazon leading the group\u2014but also offer relatively appealing valuations compared to Microsoft discounting for growth forecasts and historical valuations.\nAlphabet\u2019s recent performance in the cloud segment and ongoing investments in AI and self-driving cars show huge promise, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio remains appealing given its growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s growth prospects are bolstered by its dominant position in e-commerce and the ever-expanding AWS, which remains a leader in the cloud infrastructure market. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s valuation is more favorable relative to its growth rate and historical average, making it an attractive option for those focused on long-term potential.\nIn contrast, Microsoft\u2019s substantial capital expenditures on AI and other tech advancements\u2014though expected to drive future growth\u2014have been flagged as a point of concern for now. While Microsoft remains a cloud and AI powerhouse, these elevated costs could temper near-term returns, making it comparatively less compelling at current valuations.\nOverall, Alphabet and Amazon\u2019s mix of robust growth forecasts and favorable valuations make them top picks in the cloud landscape for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in CrowdStrike Holdings implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\nInsiders have been selling lately\nEvery investor in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CrowdStrike Holdings.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CrowdStrike Holdings?\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nWe can see that CrowdStrike Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of CrowdStrike Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in CrowdStrike Holdings. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.6%. With 7.5% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO George Kurtz is the owner of 3.1% of the company's shares.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nStory Continues\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.. Insiders own US$3.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over CrowdStrike Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with CrowdStrike Holdings .\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

          "whole_article": "Incidents like the mass computer outage caused by Microsoft's third-party provider, CrowdStrike, have prompted a rethink about the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing in the financial world, central bankers and executives said at a conference in Hong Kong.\nSuch grand-scale outages have served as a wake-up call to the financial services industry, which needs to pay greater attention to operational resilience and risk management, these people said at the joint conference by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Bank for International Settlements on Thursday.\nEddie Yue Wai-man, the HKMA's CEO, said a major risk that has been identified is the use of third-party service providers. He said that firms depend heavily on big technology companies for computing power and the ability to deal with large data sets related to AI. If these major operators experience glitches, catastrophic results could radiate outward.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"If any of these few service providers suffer from IT failures or cyberattacks, the outcome could be very difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It's like CrowdStrike 10 times bigger.\"\nIn July, a botched software update by US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affected 8.5 million Windows-based devices worldwide, creating a major disruption for the airports, banks and healthcare providers that relied on its cloud computing services.\n\"CrowdStrike is a wake-up call to say, all these security software and network monitoring tools that have a high level of privilege and access across our estate and to some extent, automatic software updates - how comfortable are we with that,\" said Balbir Bakhshi, chief risk officer at the London Stock Exchange Group.\n\"There is an opportunity to do something different in this space through a more collaborative approach.\"\nGreater regulation of third parties and increasing public-private partnerships would be helpful, he said. He added that a lot of time and effort would be freed up when there is a set of regulator-approved control standards for the industry.\nYue said banks are required to conduct risk assessments of AI service providers to strengthen their operational resilience and must have in place contingency plans to address potential service disruptions caused by third parties.\nStory Continues\nThese \"basic, common sense\" moves are essential to better safeguard companies and other institutions, said James Elwes, HSBC's chief information officer for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"[Third-party risk management] starts with simply identifying where your concentration risk is and documenting that,\" he said. \"If you've not done that, you're not going to do any of the next steps that are important.\"\nVendor diversification could help to solve some issues, Elwes said, but he added that big tech companies are often the most well-equipped to be third-party service providers.\n\"There are benefits to concentration simply because of the nature of some of these organisations - the scale they can provide and the investment they can put in,\" he said.\n\"So a degree of concentration on vendors, especially within technology, is likely to remain.\"\nSarah Breeden, deputy governor at the Bank of England, said in a pre-recorded speech that financial institutions are expected to have a \"stronger and more rigorous\" grasp of AI as they increase their dependence on it for \"higher impact areas of their businesses.\" These areas include credit risk assessment, capital management and algorithmic trading.\nHong Kong's government unveiled its first guidelines on the responsible use of AI on Monday. They said any financial institution that wants to use AI must have a strategy on how the systems should be implemented and used, as well as offer advisory and training services for on-premise deployment.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

          "whole_article": "We recently made a list of Jefferies\u2019 Top Crowded Software Short Positions: Top 9 Stocks. In this piece, we will take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks on the list of crowded software short positions.\nWith the close of 2024 approaching fast, artificial intelligence continues to set the narrative on Wall Street. The tail end of October marks the start of another highly anticipated earnings season, which for the most part, will continue to be dominated by AI. On the hardware front, investors will be on the lookout for whether the demand for AI GPUs is sustaining and if the firm that is the market leader is also improving its margins and profitability. For software stocks, investors will pour over profitability data to determine whether the billions of dollars invested in training and testing AI as well as in business partnerships are yielding results.\nFor software stocks, their exposure to AI is so strong that it has divided the 2024 stock performance of some firms into neat halves determined by investor sentiment about their AI products. One such AI software stock ranked 5th on our recent list of AI stocks that insiders are selling. Looking at its year-to-date share price performance, it\u2019s rather neatly divided into two halves that converge on June 13th. Year to date on June 13th, the shares were down 19.8% even though the firm\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenue was a cool $19.4 billion and had grown by 10% annually. Before that eventful day, the firm\u2019s first quarter had seen it grow revenue by 11% annually but struggle to keep costs low and profit margins high.\nYet, the investor bearishness surrounding this well-known provider of productivity software tools such as Photoshop and Reader, would change in the blink of an eye. From June 13th to the third week of October, the shares have reversed course and gained 8.5%. In fact, between the 13th and September 12th, the stock had gained 27.9%. June 13th was the day that this firm reported its second-quarter earnings. The results led to its shares jumping by 13% in aftermarket trading, with investors impressed by the fact that the firm increased full-year guidance to range between $21.40 billion and $21.50 billion from an earlier $21.30 billion $21.50 billion.\nThe optimism was driven in part by the firm\u2019s Creative Cloud business which includes products such as Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, and Express. The AI addition to Creative Cloud was the firm\u2019s set of generative AI models dubbed Firefly. Management shared that Firefly was at the heart of the ARR guidance bump to $1.95 billion as they shared:\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the Digital Media business and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services and Express. We\u2019re pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half.\u201d\nWith AI profitability driving the second-quarter earnings season, investors were naturally ecstatic and sent the stock higher.\nHowever, the June respite would be short-lived as the shares tanked by 13.4% in September. As usual, AI was the culprit. The downward trend started in the form of a 9.2% drop in after-market following the firm\u2019s third-quarter report. It saw the company guide Q4 revenue at a midpoint of $5.525 billion which fell below the $5.61 billion analyst consensus.\nWhile this firm is a consumer and professional software stock, the broader software as a service (SaaS) industry hasn\u2019t been spared by the AI-driven Wall Street trends either. SaaS and software stocks are predominantly valued through two metrics: the Rule of 40 and EV/Sales (or variants such as EV/EBITDA or Price to Sales). These multiples are somewhat unique to the software and SaaS stock narrative as they evaluate the firms based on their ability to grow. This is key since one of the main reasons behind SaaS stock popularity is that they do not have to deal with inventory, logistics, or supply chain issues like other businesses.\nIn the AI era, SaaS valuation multiples and revenue growth estimates have been severely compressed. Data shows that the median price to forward sales SaaS multiple is 5.5x right now. The valuations are driven by lower growth expectations. After AI and the decimation ushered in by high interest rates, just 1% of SaaS and software companies have a 12-month future revenue growth rate higher than 30% as of June 2024. Digging deeper, investors have also placed a higher premium on growth as while firms with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 have a median EV/Sales multiple of 8.9x, those with a growth rate greater than 30% but a Rule of 40 score lesser than 40 have a median multiple of 11.6x.\nThese AI-driven software shifts, precipitated by worries of a reduction in SaaS demand due to businesses self-developing software using AI have also affected investor sentiment. According to Jefferies\u2019 latest Trading Positioning Survey, 19% of institutional investors were overweight on software stocks as of October 2024, a sharp drop over July\u2019s reading of 28% and January\u2019s 51%. Yet, investors have also tempered their short positions as Jefferies shows that 54 software stocks were shorted as of October compared to 73 in July.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software short positions, we ranked the top nine crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nAn international stock trader intently watching the markets on a floor of monitors.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a well-known cybersecurity software provider that rose to fame earlier this year after its faulty software update led to an unbelievable 8.5 million computers going offline worldwide. The outage also flipped the firm\u2019s narrative, as the shares lost more than 42% of their value over the next two weeks. However, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has managed to control some of the damage from the outage as its shares are up 24.9% year to date and 41.6% since the post-outage bottom. Part of the recovery is based on easing investor worries of customer loss as CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) might be able to prevent fallout due to high switching costs. Investors will nevertheless be on the watchout for customers jumping ship, and they will also monitor CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s fiscal 2031 recurring revenue guidance of $10 billion and midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of crowded software shorts according to Jefferies. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $982.26 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25%. The $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +27.5% and +22.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) Rebounds Amid Post-Outage Challenges\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity software products provider that made headlines earlier this year due to a faulty software update that caused one of the biggest software outages in history. The outage affected an unbelievable 8.5 million computers worldwide, and it is now shaping CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s narrative as well. While the shares are up by 42% since the post-outage bottom, compared to the pre-outage peak, they are still down 20.8%. Investors are waiting to see whether the reputational impacts from the outage might lead businesses to not renew their contracts with CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s Falcon system. As for the firm, it is still targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by its fiscal year 2031 and a midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%. Consequently, investors will be combing CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s upcoming earnings with a fine-toothed comb to see if customer sentiment has weakened to make meeting these guidelines difficult.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 9th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn\u2019t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits.\nREAD ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4\nAs we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it\u2019s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries.\nAs reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself.

          "whole_article": "Many Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nBroadcom Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Hock Tan, for US$26m worth of shares, at about US$173 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$169. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).\nBroadcom insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\ninsider-trading-volume\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nBroadcom Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Broadcom. Specifically, insiders ditched US$60m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of Broadcom\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Broadcom insiders own 1.3% of the company, worth about US$10b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Broadcom Tell Us?\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Broadcom. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.\nStory Continues\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other S&P 500 stocks.\nAs per AXA Investment Managers, the US dominated financial markets this year. The investment firm believes that the broader economy has been stronger than anticipated with GDP growth running at an annualized rate of 3.0% in Q2. The blue-chip benchmark, S&P 500 index, has surged ~22% on a YTD basis. Also, the US fixed-income markets saw strong returns. Overall, the financial markets were supported by the success of the US Fed in dealing with inflation.\nInterest rates have started to move lower, with credit markets reflecting the strength of the broader US corporate sector, per AXA Investment Managers. At the start of October 2024, the investment firm mentioned that a 50:50 allocation to the S&P 500 Growth equity index and the ICE US High Yield bond index might have resulted in a return of ~18% YTD.\nS&P 500 Index \u2013 The Road Ahead\nForbes believes that the prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. While the momentum in technology innovation, together with the environment of lower interest rates, should help the broader S&P 500 index, investors are required to be wary of certain risks. These include elevated valuations, global tensions, and uncertainty regarding the US presidential election.\nAccording to ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, which is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor (RIA), the ongoing innovation in AI and lower rates should help the\u00a0S&P 500 Index see growth in the range of 14.5% \u2013 19.6%. Another firm, Running Point Capital Advisors, expects the S&P 500 to see an increase of 7% \u2013 11% in 2025, with some volatility. As per the company, the influencing factors include economic growth, expansion in earnings, higher mergers and acquisitions activity, and a\u00a0favorable interest rate environment.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\nSectors To Keep on Radar\nForbes highlighted that investors are required to keep certain sectors, like technology, healthcare, and energy, on the\u00a0radar in 2025. As per IDC, worldwide spending on AI, which includes AI-enabled applications, infrastructure, and associated IT and business services, should more than double by 2028 to reach $632 billion. The incorporation of AI, and generative AI (GenAI) in particular, in a range of products should result in a\u00a0CAGR of ~29.0% over 2024-2028, which should help the broader technology sector.\nStory Continues\nDefinitive Healthcare believes that investors should see more device makers and pharmaceutical companies jump on the D2C bandwagon in 2025. Also, ICRA, a Credit Rating Agency, expects a strong financial outlook for the broader hospital industry in FY 2025. The optimistic outlook stems from the increasing incidence of non-communicable lifestyle diseases, a rise in per capita healthcare spending, increased medical tourism, and penetration of health insurance.\nUS Energy Information Administration, in its short-term energy outlook report (October 2024), mentioned that the summer temperatures this year were warmer in the US as compared to last summer, mainly in the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which supported pushing up the US electricity demand. EIA expects 2% more U.S. sales of electricity to ultimate customers in 2024 as compared to 2023, followed by another 2% expected growth in 2025. Overall, it expects electricity sales to increase throughout economic sectors. It projects that commercial electricity sales will rise by 3% this year followed by a 1% growth in 2025.\nBroadcom Inc.

After getting the list, stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds were chosen. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holdings: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.\nWall Street analysts opine that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s long-term growth trajectory is expected to be aided by its competitive advantages, which stem from\u00a0intangible assets in chip design and switching costs for the software products. The company plans to continue its focus on hyperscalers, cloud, and digital natives for AI products. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) anticipates a recovery in non-AI markets and robust AI revenue growth in fiscal 2025.\nIts strategic financial management, which includes debt restructuring and dividend payouts, demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a\u00a0healthy balance sheet while, at the same time, delivering value to shareholders. Its focus on AI and collaboration with Seagate reflect its emphasis on innovation and market trends. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been positioning itself for strong growth in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.\nThe company is a critical player in the AI revolution, leveraging expertise in custom silicon and networking solutions in a bid to tap a\u00a0substantial share of the expanding market. The robust demand for its AI accelerators and Ethernet solutions should continue to aid its topline. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s strong position in custom AI silicon and high-speed networking solutions position it as the leader in the\u00a0AI revolution.\nAnalysts at Mizuho increased their price objective on shares of Broadcom Inc.

As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Another kitchen sink type of earnings day from chip giant Intel (INTC).\nIntel stock (INTC) rose slightly in premarket trading on Friday as the struggling US icon managed to serve up better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Shares had been up about 8% late Thursday, but a cautious earnings call subdued sentiment.\n\"This was a critical quarter for us, and I think [it] gives optimism for what is to come,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance moments after the company's earnings call ended (video above).\n\u2022 USD\n(INTC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe somewhat positive market reaction may be a tad overdone when digging into the quarterly results.\nIntel revealed $15.9 billion in total non-cash charges related to inventory write-downs and lower performance expectations for certain businesses, such as autonomous driving firm Mobileye (MBLY), where it owns a majority stake. The company reported a $5.8 billion operating loss at Intel Foundry \u2014 Intel's upstart chipmaking business \u2014 on $4.4 billion in sales.\nIntel took a cautious stance on the health of the foundry business and its artificial intelligence product roadmap in 2025.\n\"The bad news, in our view, is that Intel's AI strategy appears to have changed again, now with what seems to be a longer-term approach that centers on the traditional CPU+co-processor/accelerator approach to Enterprise class AI workloads,\" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note on Friday.\nOn the earnings call, management promised to continue executing a $10 billion cost-cutting plan and exploring alternative sources of funding to support chipmaking ambitions.\nGelsinger told Yahoo Finance that no deal is imminent in terms of external funding.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger holds a sample of a wafer during his keynote speech at Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images\nHe reiterated that Intel will push forward with opening chipmaking plants in states like Ohio and Arizona despite not receiving billions of dollars in funding yet from the CHIPS Act.\nThe Biden administration has earmarked $8.5 billion in direct funding to Intel for its projects, but the company is still awaiting the cash as government officials iron out milestones that it must hit.\n\"Overall, we are seeing the CHIPS Act as a critical thing that we've invested a lot of time and energy into, and as we said on our earnings call, we're disappointed by the time that it's taken to get done,\" Gelsinger said.\n\"It's well over two years since the CHIPS Act passed. And over that period, I've invested $30 billion in US manufacturing and we've seen $0 from the CHIPS Act. This has taken too long. We need to get it finished.\"\nTo be sure, Wall Street still sees a bumpy road ahead for Intel.\nStory Continues\nIntel faces an \"uphill battle\" to turn itself around and compete with the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Taiwan's TSMC (TSM), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari recently told Yahoo Finance.\nHe added the company will need some time to get its technology \u2014 notably AI chips \u2014 on par with its rivals, if they can do it at all.\nAnd BofA analyst Vivek Arya struck a cautious tone on Intel in a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast (listen here).\nGelsinger also clarified the company's relationship with TSMC to Yahoo Finance.\nReuters reported that Gelsinger made comments early on in his Intel tenure that strained the relationship with the semiconductor manufacturing giant. In turn, TSMC pulled a discount it was giving Intel on 3-nanometer wafers.\n\"They are an awesome company. They have just created the foundry model. They service customers extremely well, and they service us well. And, Lunar Lake, the AI PC that we spoke about, we couldn't do it without TSMC \u2014 they've been critical to that project's success,\" Gelsinger said.\n\"That said, we want to be a Western foundry at scale, and we think that's seminally important for the Western world. ... And finally, I supply them with some of our advanced equipment as well. So it's a complex relationship but critically important for Intel, for TSMC, for the industry,\" added Gelsinger, who called TSMC a customer and a competitor that they have a great partnership with.\nIntel shares are down 55% year to date.\n\u2022 USD\n(INTC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe earnings rundown\nNet Sales: -6% year over year to $13.3 billion vs. estimate of $13.02 billion\nClient Computing Sales: $7.3 billion vs. estimate of $7.46 billion\nData Center & AI Sales: $3.3 billion vs. $3.15 billion\nNetwork & Edge Sales: $1.5 billion vs. $1.39 billion\nMobileye Sales: $485 million vs. $485.5 million\nIntel Foundry Sales: $4.4 billion vs. $4.44 billion\nAdjusted Gross Margin: 18% vs. 38% estimate\nAdjusted EPS: -$0.46 (+$0.41 a year ago) vs. estimate for -$0.03\nWhat else caught our attention: Fourth quarter guidance\nNet Sales: $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion vs. estimate of $13.63 billion\nAdjusted EPS: $0.12 vs. $0.06 estimate\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMicrosoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from \u201cthird parties\u201d weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software.\n\u201cMicrosoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can\u2019t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,\u201d wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\nPersistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft\u2019s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen.\nCEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark. (MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN via Getty Images\n\u201cAs long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow \u2026 the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.\u201d\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. \u201cAs we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,\u201d said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company\u2019s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be \u201clikely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.\u201d\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u2019 quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company\u2019s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday.\nStory Continues\nTo be sure, Big Tech companies\u2019 AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google\u2019s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the BofA's List Of AI & Semiconductor Stocks That Fund Managers Love & Hate: 16 Stocks On The Manager Radar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate.\nThe initial wave of artificial intelligence investing has shaken up the stock market. Suddenly, technology stocks are divided between those that have exposure to AI and those that don't. The former category has soared to set records while the latter has been lackluster because of the state of sluggishness in the non-AI business world.\nWithin AI stocks that have outdone themselves, semiconductor stocks are a standout. Additionally, just as is the case with broader technology stocks, semiconductor stocks are also divided between those with AI and non-AI exposure. The best example of the former category is Wall Street's top AI stock pick. This stock is of a firm that designs and sells GPUs used to process AI workloads. Its shares are up 845% since the 2023 start and have set multiple records since OpenAI's Chat GPT became publicly available.\nOn the flip side, another semiconductor stock has floundered during the same period even though it's one of the oldest and largest semiconductor companies in the world. This stock belongs to a firm that is also one of the only three companies in the world that can manufacture high-end semiconductors and it is the only one which is headquartered in the US. While the GPU designer's shares have gained 845%, over the same time, this semiconductor stock is down 13.9%, and year to date the shares have bled an unbelievable 53.14%.\nTherein lies the bifurcation between semiconductor stocks that is fueled by the artificial intelligence wave. However, these returns might belong to the first stage of AI stocks only, implying that other semiconductor companies could also see gains provided robust AI software demand and the ability of firms to monetize their products.\u00a0 We covered a lot of such potential stocks as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks.\nIn this list, there were five semiconductor stocks. Four of these are semiconductor manufacturers while the remaining stock is the firm whose designs are the backbone of the modern-day smartphone industry. The stocks are ranked 19th, 16th, 14th, 8th, and 6th. Looking at their year-to-date performance, these stocks are up roughly 45%, 51.7%, 65.7%, 97.8%, and 122% year-to-date, respectively. Safe to say, the AI wave has been kind to these stocks. The next step in our brief analysis is to see what analysts believe the future holds for these firms. To do this, one particularly useful ratio is the forward price to earnings since it gauges the current price to analyst estimates of future earnings.\nStory Continues\nFor these five phase two AI semiconductor stocks, the forward P/E ratios in respective orders are roughly 31.25, 50.51, 29.41, 25.19, and 99 times. The forward P/E ratio for global and US semiconductor stocks is 45.77 so most of these stocks are fairly valued. Consequently, this implies that in case of an AI correction that sees investor sentiment evaporate for any reason, these stocks might not be hit as hard as those speculating about an 'AI bubble' might worry, but if Wall Street finds more reasons to add to its AI euphoria, then their valuation might further bloom for more gains.\nShifting gears, the average forward P/E ratio for the semiconductor industry also leads us to wonder which stocks are driving this average value higher. After all, the six AI chip stocks we've covered above include some of the biggest companies in the world. However, high P/E ratios commonly belong to smaller companies that earn small profits but have a much higher share price. Two stocks that we've identified that have at least 2x the average forward P/E ratio are both unprofitable right now. The one with the higher forward P/E ratio of 196.08 ranks 20th on our list of Piper Sandler\u2019s Top Technical Stock Picks: 20 Best Stocks while the second with a beefy ratio of 133.33 ranked 32nd on this list of AI stocks that were recently trending.\nSo, the next question to ask is, what makes these stocks so special that despite the fact that neither is currently profitable, investors have valued their shares more than 100 times over their projected earnings? Well, starting from the first stock with the higher P/E ratio, this firm is one of the few hardened integrated circuit manufacturers in the US. It makes radiation-resistant chips for the US military and its tools enable chip designs at various nodes. The second stock, which is up 49% year to date, is a specialty chip manufacturer that makes and sells silicon-based timing devices as an alternative to quartz-based products. These are used in applications such as edge computing and 5G networks - systems that are closer to end users and therefore must endure more strenuous working environments.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of semiconductor stocks that fund managers love and hate according to BofA, we used its recent list of semiconductor stocks that were popular or losing popularity with fund managers. The list was divided into two sections based on expansion or decline in ownership.\u00a0 Stocks within each category were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. For an interesting exercise, you can also compare these stocks with those on our lists of Goldman Sachs\u2019 List Of Stocks That Hedge & Mutual Funds Love & Hate: 28 Stocks On The Mutual and Hedge Funds Radar.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 130\nSection: Gaining Popularity\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a diversified technology company with a presence in the semiconductor and SaaS industries. It has exposure to the semiconductor industry via modems, network controllers, network processors, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These allow Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) products to operate in the smartphone, laptop, and data center industries. The firm also benefits from its ASIC business as it allows it to. work with companies interested in designing their custom AI chips. Consequently, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0 has a wide semiconductor moat which allows it to profit from several industries. Its cybersecurity business adds margin-heavy revenue to the income statement, making Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) one of the most well-rounded firms in the world. However, with Apple's propensity to shift to its in-house chips, the firm could see headwinds in the future if Apple decides to self-design and make chips such as MacBook WiFi modules.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the UBS' Top Tech Based Disruptive Stocks For 2030: Top 29 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

OpenAI has been planning a custom chip and working on such uses for the technology for around a year, the people said, but the discussions are still at an early stage.\nOpenAI declined to comment. A representative for Broadcom didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and a TSMC spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on rumors and speculation. Reuters reported on OpenAI\u2019s ongoing talks with Broadcom and TSMC on Tuesday. The Information reported in June that Broadcom had discussed making an AI chip for OpenAI.\nThe process for taking a chip from design to production is long and expensive. OpenAI is less focused on graphics processing units, chips that are used to train and build generative AI models \u2014 a market that has been cornered by Nvidia Corp. Instead, it\u2019s looking for a specialized chip that will run the software and respond to user requests, a process called inference. Investors and analysts expect the need for chips to support inference will only grow as more tech companies use AI models to field more complex tasks.\nOpenAI may continue to research setting up its own network of foundries, or chip factories, one of the people said, but the startup has realized that working with partners on custom chips is a quicker, attainable path for now. Reuters earlier reported that OpenAI was pulling back from the effort of establishing its own chip manufacturing capacity.\nBroadcom shares closed up 4.2% to $179.24 in New York trading on Tuesday. Even before the latest gain, they were up 54% this year. TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares closed more than 1% higher.\nBroadcom is the largest designer of application-specific integrated circuits \u2014 chips designed to fit a single purpose specified by the customer. The company\u2019s biggest customer in this area is Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Broadcom also works with Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\nStory Continues\nWhen asked last month whether he has new customers for the business, given the huge demand for AI training, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that he will only add to his short list of customers when projects hit volume shipments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy product to deploy for any customer, and so we do not consider proof of concepts as production volume,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call.\nOpenAI\u2019s services require massive amounts of computing power to develop and run \u2014 with much of that coming from Nvidia chips. To meet the demand, the industry has been scrambling to find alternatives to Nvidia. That\u2019s included embracing processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and developing in-house versions.\nOpenAI is also actively planning investments and partnerships in data centers, the eventual home for such AI chips. The startup\u2019s leadership has pitched the US government on the need for more massive data centers and CEO Sam Altman has sounded out global investors, including some in the Middle East, to finance the effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stretch,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told Bloomberg Television on Monday. \u201cStretch from a capital perspective but also my own learning.

          "whole_article": "OpenAI is reportedly embarking on a new chapter in its artificial intelligence development journey\u2014it's building its own in-house chip.\nAccording to Reuters, which cited exclusive sources close to the company, OpenAI is collaborating with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to diversify its supply chain and control infrastructure costs as it seeks to keep up with the immense computational needs of AI.\nWhile OpenAI had previously considered building its own chip manufacturing foundries, the high costs and lengthy timeline led the company to prioritize in-house chip design. Currently, OpenAI has assembled a team of roughly 20 chip engineers, including experts with experience designing Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Together, they hope to develop OpenAI's first custom chip by 2026\u2014though that timeline is flexible.\nThe news on Tuesday sent Broadcom Inc. shares up 4% and TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares gained more than 1%.\nThe move reflects OpenAI's ongoing strategy to secure consistent chip supply and manage escalating costs, a challenge that other tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft have also faced in their AI ventures. This effort includes OpenAI\u2019s recent decision to integrate AMD chips, along with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, which continue to dominate the market but are in limited supply. In fact, tech giants have been literally begging Nvidia for more chips.\nAt a meeting with analysts last month, billionaire\u00a0Oracle\u00a0cofounder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said he and world\u2019s-richest-man Elon Musk took Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang out to dinner at\u00a0Nobu\u00a0Palo Alto and \u201cbegged\u201d for more GPUs.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The market for ServiceNow, Inc.'s (NYSE:NOW) shares didn't move much after it posted weak earnings recently. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nSee our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-history\nZooming In On ServiceNow's Earnings\nOne key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.\nServiceNow has an accrual ratio of -0.40 for the year to September 2024. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$3.4b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$1.34b. ServiceNow shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On ServiceNow's Profit Performance\nAs we discussed above, ServiceNow's accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is a positive for the company. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that ServiceNow's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at an extremely impressive rate over the last three years. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing ServiceNow at this point in time. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for ServiceNow and you'll want to know about these.\nStory Continues\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of ServiceNow's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "Bill McDermott is very intense.\u00a0When he first joined ServiceNow as CEO in 2019\u2014he was previously CEO of SAP\u2014he met all 7,000 employees and shook hands with every single one of them.\n\u201cIn the first hundred days I was here, I travelled the whole world. The whole world. I met every single person that works for this company in person, and shook their hand.\u201d\nHandshake intensity is a thing, in McDermott's world.\nThe first handshake is incredibly important, he says. It\u2019s part of his mindset, especially for dealing with clients. He advises sales people, upon entering a room with a prospective client, to \u201cfind the decision-maker and shake his hand, but be the last one to let go.\u201d\nHe spoke to Fortune recently in a penthouse suite at the Four Seasons hotel in London, during a business trip to meet clients.\nQuestion 1: Does this handshake thing really work?\n\u201cYes, it does.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not a perfunctory exercise to greet somebody. It's not a perfunctory exercise to shake somebody's hand. They have to know you're in the room and you have to let them know that you care,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo just to shake hands as if it's just some standard thing to do is not enough.\u201d\n(So, was my handshake any good? \u201cYou were fine. I wasn't judging you.\u201d)\nMcDermott\u2019s stewardship of ServiceNow is certainly working. Five years later, ServiceNow has 26,000 employees, revenues of $2.8 billion per quarter and a market cap of more than $195 billion.\nThe AI-driven enterprise software company counts clients such as IBM, KPMG, and Deloitte, for whom it provides a vast range of back-end software that handles customer service, IT operations, security, and new employee on-boarding, among dozens of other services.\nThe handshake thing is a good example of McDermott\u2019s intense, driven style. This is a man who only sleeps for five hours a night. He wakes up at 5 a.m., reads three newspapers, drinks an espresso, does a light workout and walks his dog, Amber. He\u2019s in the office by 8 a.m. He usually continues working until 11 p.m. at night.\nQuestion 2: Can you really get by on just five hours\u2019 sleep?\n\u201cFive hours a night, you know, which is fine,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the week, you know, like it's \u2018go time.\u2019\u201d\nHe sleeps a bit more on weekends.\nQuestion 3: Does ServiceNow have supply issues with Nvidia?\nMost products offered by ServiceNow are driven by AI.\nSo is he getting what he needs from Nvidia, the AI chipmaker that has been accused of not being able to meet demand for all its customers?\n\u201cPerhaps we're fortunate because we have such a strategic relationship but Nvidia has fulfilled all of our requirements and done a great job,\u201d he says.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe started building models with Jensen [Huang, the CEO] several years ago, and we were the first mover in enterprise software building with Nvidia's GPU stack.\u201d\nQuestion 4: Will you cave to Robby Starbuck?\nMcDermott isn\u2019t afraid of the usual culture-war controversies that have come to bedevil leaders at large corporations. ServiceNow, for instance, has a well-developed, public facing DEI program, of the type that has lately become unfashionable.\nRobby Starbuck\u2014the conservative activist who organizes boycotts of companies that he believes are too \u201cwoke\u201d\u2014recently forced Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson, among others, to back away from their DEI initiatives.\nSo what will McDermott do if Starbuck comes calling?\n\u201cWell the good news about ServiceNow is we haven't played \u2018acronym bingo,\u2019\u201d McDermott says.\n\u201cIf you're not growing and you're managing and all you talk about is corporate acronyms, that could be a problem for that phone call. But when you're growing like we are, we have to source talent from every corner of the earth to keep up with the pace of our growth. So if we didn't believe in diversity, if we didn't have an equitable and an inclusive culture, there's no way we could be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. So I think that call would be pretty simple.\u201d\nQuestion 5: Is working remotely OK?\nMcDermott is not a fan of 100% remote working. He asked the company to return to the office about two years ago. ServiceNow currently has a flexible policy in which some employees come in two days a week unless they are designated remote workers.\n\u201cI believe strongly that people do their best work in person.\u201d\n\u201cWe need everybody in the company to cross-pollinate and innovate and work as teams. So, basically, when I asked the company to do it, I didn't have to mandate it. I just had to say, we need it now, we have to hit the accelerator, people came back.\u201d\nBut when the CEO says \u201cwe need it now,\u201d surely that's a mandate?\n\u201cIf they trust you, it's not a mandate. It's a desire. It is \u2018I need you. I trust you. I want you with me.\u2019 I'm not telling you I have to have you tied to a chair, and I'm not telling you I'm going to fire you if you don't do it. I'm telling you, I need you to do it and I don't ask for things that I don't need. And they responded next day, the parking lots are all full. There\u2019s a difference between leading and managing and I don't think it's healthy to actually have people that feel forced into things,\u201d he says. \u201cOne volunteer is worth 10 pressed people.\u201d\nQuestion 6: Are you a micromanager or do you prefer to delegate?\nThis question is important because McDermott has, in the past, insisted on riding along on sales calls with his staff.\n\u201cI hire people that are the best in the world at what they do and I trust them with my life. I think trust is the ultimate human currency and I think the best leaders hire people that are substantially better than them. In every area of domain expertise. So, if you have a CFO, they have to be better than you at finance. If you have a CHRO, they have to know more about the people equation than you do. If you hire a head of engineering, they have to be an extraordinary exemplar of an engineering manager and they should know a lot more than you do. In other words, when I look around the table of my leadership team, I'm humbled, that's how good they are.\u201d\n\u201cI also believe strongly that we have to go into the details and we have to be with our customers and we have to be shoulder to shoulder with the customer so you understand the pain that they deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cI become obsessed with their problems. And I want 26,000 people to be obsessed with their problems, so we come up with new solutions to make them better.\u201d\nQuestion 7: What is the most difficult thing you have tackled as CEO?\nGrowing the company from 7,000 people to 26,000 must have involved some difficulties. But McDermott won't admit it.\n\u201cI love scale. I came here from a company that had a hundred thousand people. So my whole life has been spent scaling companies, so the things that people might find difficult, we find great joy in, we bring new people into the culture, we get new people to buy into the\u00a0purpose.\u201d\nThat sounds like PR spin. Surely there must have been pain points while growing ServiceNow?\n\u201cI've encountered thousands of challenges, but is that a difficulty? Or is that a challenge? Is that A setback? Or is that an opportunity,\u201d he says.\nAnd then, just in case you needed a reminder of the level of intensity he is working at, he adds:\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what is pain? Your pain might be my pleasure.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Whether you\u2019re a Pacesetter or still in the beginning stages of a digital journey, these findings show that the future is promising for those willing to embrace AI.\"\nKey findings from The State of AI-Powered Transformation in Government include:\nImproving Speed of Mission\nPacesetters significantly improve their speed and agility by integrating automation into their organizations\u2019 processes. This profoundly impacts both government employees and the citizens they serve.\nFaster time to value with more benefits. Most Pacesetters (61%) achieve a 1.5X faster return on digital investments and report greater outcomes from those investments \u2013 including higher asset utilization and return (50%), improved compliance and risk management (49%), and faster public services (41%).\nAutomating workflows with end-to-end platforms. Pacesetters are making greater progress in implementing end-to-end platforms, with 67% expecting to make advanced progress within the next three years. Currently, 59% have invented new cross-functional workflows that leverage human and AI collaboration.\nAccelerating productivity and ability to scale transformation. Pacesetters boost productivity via specific digital solutions, such as mobile apps (64%), performance management systems (43%), and AI-enabled tools (38%). Those investments are paying off for Pacesetters, measured by improved staff retention (49%), employee upskilling and reskilling (44%), and productivity (41%).\nStory Continues\nAI-Powered Citizen Service Delivery\nPacesetters are finding new momentum within their Citizen Experience (CX) efforts through unique uses of AI and other digital solutions. This is not only improving citizen service delivery but also helping build trust.\nReshaping government services with AI. Governments are using AI in various ways to accelerate citizen service delivery. The top uses for AI among Pacesetters include personalization of citizen communication and engagement, continuous service improvement with feedback loops, and citizen queries and recommendations.\nTechnology improves citizen experience and builds trust. Pacesetters are making greater use of apps and automation to reach citizens. Compared to the general population of government agencies in our survey, Pacesetters are more likely to deploy mobile apps that citizens can use to access government services (47%), digital identities for easy and secure access to public services (46%), and automated responses to citizen problems or requests (44%).\nTech investments are beginning to drive CX improvements. Those embracing AI are starting to see the tangible CX benefits from their digital solutions investments, reporting higher increases in self-service success (47%) and higher citizen satisfaction (45%).\nTo view the full research report and uncover how governments across the globe can improve their AI-driven transformation, please visit: https://www.servicenow.com/lpwhp/state-of-ai-powered-transformation-in-government.html.\nMethodology\nServiceNow and ThoughtLab surveyed 1,248 leaders from around the globe and across agency types to determine how much progress government organizations have made in driving AI-powered business transformation across local, state/provincial, and national government organizations.\nAbout ServiceNow:\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the UBS' Top Tech Based Disruptive Stocks For 2030: Top 29 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software as a service (SaaS) firm that provides business process management products and services. This means that the stock and the firm's revenue are dependent on business activity which is influenced by economic health. Consequently, as the economy has continued to chug along in 2024, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s stock is up 38% year to date. Over its four latest quarters, the firm has raked in $1.3 billion in trailing twelve month net income on the back of continued deal diversification. Through this, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) grew its customers with recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% in Q2, and it added six new customers with annual contract value greater than $10 million in Q3. These metrics are key for SaaS companies like ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) as they help broaden the revenue base and add margin heavy revenue to the income statement.\nDuring the Q3 2024 earnings call, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s management shared key details about its deals:\n\"From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was very strong, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Retail and Hospitality also had a fantastic quarter, growing over 80% year-over-year. Health care and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date, U.S. Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution, further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and two over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nOverall NOW ranks 8th on our list of UBS' top tech based disruptive stocks for 2030. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 1.88%\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the biggest SaaS companies in the world. The firm provides products that enable users to automate their business processes and manage human resource operations, IT operations, and others. The firm has raked in $1.1 billion in trailing twelve-month net income and its shares are up 33.5% year to date. Since it\u2019s a SaaS stock, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u2019s narrative depends on its ability to sustain revenue levels, maintain profitability, grow its customer base, and increase the portion of larger deals within the overall mix. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) appears to be executing well on these fronts. During the second quarter, the firm grew customers with annual recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% and its committed remaining performance obligations by 31% to a whopping $18.6 billion. The latter is a particularly important metric since it measures the money that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is nearly guaranteed to receive in the future. This helps evaluate the firm\u2019s future cash flows.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in\u00a0Adobe\u00a0and\u00a0ServiceNow\u00a0earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 6th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

It is now indicated in the United States and the EU to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost. The positive recommendation in the EU for approval of Wegovy for heart failure is also encouraging.\n\nHowever, the CRL for insulin icodec in the United States is a setback for the company. Intense competition in the obesity sector also threatens Novo Nordisk\u2019s market share. Patent expiry, pricing pressures across the diabetes market and the pipeline setbacks remain concerning. Estimates have declined ahead of third-quarter earnings results.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\n\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+62.2% vs. +5.0%).

Apple expects the September quarter\u2019s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s shares have gained +9.2% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry\u2019s gain of +19.7%. The company\u2019s diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy are performing well, fueled by increasing demand. Label expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.\n\nNovo Nordisk has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by making serious investments in increasing its manufacturing capabilities. It is now indicated in the United States and the EU to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost. The positive recommendation in the EU for approval of Wegovy for heart failure is also encouraging.\n\nHowever, the CRL for insulin icodec in the United States is a setback for the company. Intense competition in the obesity sector also threatens Novo Nordisk\u2019s market share. Patent expiry, pricing pressures across the diabetes market and the pipeline setbacks remain concerning. Estimates have declined ahead of third-quarter earnings results.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\n\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+62.2% vs. +5.0%). The company ended Q3 2024 on a solid note, with both its earnings and sales having surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It continues to receive ample orders for its wide range of combat-proven defense products from the Pentagon and our foreign allies.\n\nImproving commercial air traffic has been bolstering the company\u2019s operating results. RTX holds a solid financial position, which enables it to make successful share repurchases. The company\u2019s shares have outperformed its industry in the past year.\n\nHowever, potentially rising crude prices tens to put cost pressures on airlines that may affect the operating results of commercial OEM producers like RTX. The company may also be affected if China enforces its announced sanctions against its missile and defense unit. Supply-chain challenges also pose a threat to RTX.\n\n(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)\n\nFONAR\u2019s shares have gained +15.9% over the past year versus the Zacks Medical - Products industry\u2019s gain of +33.8%. This microcap company, with a market capitalization of $97.4 million, demonstrated stable growth, with fiscal 2024 revenues up 4.3% to $102.9 million, driven by its subsidiary HMCA\u2019s 4.6% growth in diagnostic imaging. Managing 42 MRI scanners, FONAR expands its market with a unique Upright MRI, enhancing diagnostic options.\n\nOperational efficiency improved, with a 16.3% rise in net income to $14.1 million. A cash position of $56.3 million enables growth initiatives, while Upright MRI differentiates FONAR via unique scan capabilities. MRI scan volume grew 11%, reflecting strong demand, supported by tech upgrades like SwiftMR.\n\nYet, risks include vulnerability to reimbursement cuts, inflationary costs, competition from larger players, and reliance on the Upright MRI and regulatory pressures, particularly in core markets New York and Florida. Value-based care trends add further risk to its long-term stability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on FONAR here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ServiceNow, Inc.

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ServiceNow, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NOW a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $13.83.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.3%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.36 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for NOW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) showcases robust revenue growth and solid subscription-based earnings.\nStrategic expansion into non-IT workflows presents significant growth opportunities.\nGlobal economic uncertainties and competitive pressures pose potential threats.\nServiceNow's strong R&D investments fuel innovation but also reflect in increased costs.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Darren. Good afternoon, everyone, I really appreciate you joining today. Because a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report, I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow is growth trajectory. First is elite level execution, with our Q3 results we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution.\nWe outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than 1 million and net new ACV.\nWe landed our second largest new logo deal ever, and our second customer crossed the 100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals, with double digit deals over 1 million.\nIt's also worth noting that it asset management was in all of our top 20 deals, and Q3 was another strong performance for security and risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over 1 million.\nAs we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over 1 million and create a workflow is strong again and 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over 1 million, here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution.\nThe second tailwind behind ServiceNow success is our growing strategic relevance. Three years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess so they can modernize for the AI world. ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platform, and we integrate with all those other systems orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here.\nWhen public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control of cost, security, and integration, and ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI.\nLeaders see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With now assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million.\nAnd this continues to be our fastest growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest GenAI release to date Xanadu.\nThis included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged now assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft co-pilot integration and more.\nXanadu expanded industry vertical AI powered automation, the telco, tech, public sector, banking insurance, and manufacturing we released now assist for security procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers.\nXanadu showcased ServiceNow leadership with Agentic AI and until now, Agentic AI and the enterprise requires human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow, single architecture platform and cross enterprise data ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond prompt based activity to deep contextual comprehension.\nThis is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across the enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy.\nThis is why IDC also forecasts businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once in a generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result.\nThe fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a present identity for our brand. The defense logistics agency works with ServiceNow assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project. Bangkok de Brazil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation.\nThe Veterans Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the Veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI powered solutions to improve its colleague experience.\nAfter rolling out now assist globally, EY works with ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks to deliver faster resolutions for enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life saving mission.\nMercedes Benz work to its ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cyber security, driving the integration of gen AI into shop floor operations. Bell Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC technologies a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace.\nWe announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out of the box use cases for AI agents on the now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints.\nCustomers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise, the small single issue resolutions all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard a knowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB our new ultra fast database built for AI first enterprises which processes transactions 12 times faster analytics 27 times faster customers including Amadeus are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems.\nOur data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we could do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real time secure access to data from any source.\nWorkflow data fabric also includes Zero Copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake. So customers can turn data into instant AI powered action all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services companies, Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market.\nThese innovations, open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow. Nearly doubling our TAM to a $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth, and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business, this is why we created ServiceNow university encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences.\nServiceNow university represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands.\nEven more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors.\nWe also rank on list for best places to work in technology in Europe and Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind, the best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO.\nAmit joins from Alphabet where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $41 billion. Before joining Google Cloud Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle where he presided over their growth and platform as a service and data analytics.\nWith sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world class engineer and engineering leader. From a commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nAnd I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Beatty, our Chief Customer Officer who did a great job in filling in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that, we as a company also did a great job.\nIn closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company, it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our World Forum events are over subscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year over year.\nBy definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge or security by virtue of our team, our technology, and our strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go, that not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond.\nI couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth -ear anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nStory Continues\nGina Mastantuono\nThank you, Bill Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow, with substantial out performances across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites. The now platform and now assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions, driving incredible business outcomes in every corner of the enterprise.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion representing 33% year-over-year in constant currency growth accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO with $9.36 billion representing 23.5% year-over-year, constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology media and telecom was very strong growing net new ACV over 100% year over year, retail and hospitality also had a fantastic quarter growing over 80% year over year.\nHealthcare and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date us, Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and $2 million over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nThe importance of the now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year by year, Powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter including six with new logos.\nAmong them 15 deals were over [5 million] and six deals were over [10 million]. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products.\nOur GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million and now assist including $6 million over $5 million and $2 million over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our plus SKU continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over [pro] in Q3.\nWith more proof points from real world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence and now it's its ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and [HRSD] Enterprise plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work.\nAnother large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self service by 30%, while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI ideas were sold direct. So we're starting to see our partner enablement produce results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners. We closed in HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency.\nIn fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter tripling net new ACV year over year led by financial services and [TMC] which both quadrupled.\nTurning to profitability non-GAAP operating margin was over 31% more than 150 basis points above our guidance driven by the timing of spend our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our cash margin was 17% up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution.\nAs of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability, and shareholder value.\nMoving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.66 billion. Representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5% operating margin of 29.5% free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis.\nWe expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser focused on delivering a complete end to end platform experience. With the Xanadu release, marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations, yet we're empowering enterprises to quickly seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence. And we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks.\nI'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally with that.\nI'll open it up for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. I will now open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first, and then a quick follow up on product. Bill -- I mean, Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year.\nBut maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months given all the tailwinds that you're seeing just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nBill McDermott\nWell, Alex, thank you very much for the question. You know, I I think the overall macro is not dissimilar, it's still a value based market out there, but it's been a value based market for some time. And so the question then becomes, who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer.\nAnd obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter. And companies especially at the C-suite are building their future plans with real partnership. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win and we want -- we work for the customer and the customer feels it. And I think culture is something that gets under reported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin\nWell, just by our calculations, just under $90 million in pro and now assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe, maybe just to follow up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what, what the incremental opportunity is with within your existing customers, with this new data platform product. And how you expect, how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and P&L?\nBill McDermott\nWell, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an up sell opportunity across the entire install base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in and by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours.\nSo it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating.\nAnd by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process, and this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record and we've been doing this for some time now.\nSo I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is the data, and so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to with independent research firms, they said, Bill ServiceNow pulls this off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here and I am too.\nAlex Zukin\nExcellent. Congratulations guys.\nBill McDermott\nThanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful uptick in head count additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch up for what had been more modest, sub 20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nGreat question, Brad. So, we told you in the past that we presented uptake our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota bearing reps. And so, absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We're planning to continue to accelerate our head count growth, but remember, we do it prudently, we do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different.\nAnd so you can expect similar levels of head count growth in the next few quarters as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with every with now assist with the Agentic AI with the workflow data fabric, all the innovation that the team is driving not only is sales and marketing head count up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick\nThanks for that, Gina. If I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask him. Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think, for some go in one year and out the other, but that's elite level execution, you're clearly out executing others. Can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is, and what you might say to skeptics concerned that?\nWe're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay the piper moment where you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies? Thank you so much, and congrats.\nBill McDermott\nWell, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you going to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders and I have the best leadership team in the industry, hard stop. And we just made that even stronger with Amit, and I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they would total collapse and this was done in a highly transparent, wonderful way.\nAnd that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud platform and ServiceNow, I feel like that's a necessary thing and I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class. Set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people.\nWe actually participate in building our plans together and then we over communicate everything and then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything in their professional careers, you can build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.\nNow, we're not even close to hitting our peak, we're not even near it. So as you think about lapping, ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the Board and get more results, but all those things are in flight and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch.\nAnd I do want to thank my partners out there. They know all word is good and they want to be part of ServiceNow . And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise, and by being that we integrate with everybody, we're open to all the LLMs that are out there you can even bring your own model and at the same time.\nWe've integrated with all the system in terms of record and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across a magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results, not just on a productivity take cost out but also on a growth level.\nAnd I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions, we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, constant planning, over communicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick\nAwesome Bill. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Brad.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our field work was showing a big ramp up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could explode heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the now assist numbers that you gave. They're just so big, and I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CORE.\nWe've investing billions into the UK and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service provide just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nBill McDermott\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm, speaking well of our company. Thank you very much.\nI do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipelines, I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things and it was great, Mark you get a kick at us. We just did a Board Meeting and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do.\nAnd he said to him, well, let's just assume, somebody's going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that soul crush people just know that now assist is automatically updating your healthcare, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most and you didn't have to touch a single thing.\nYou just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company, and everybody there said, oh man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we can fix it and that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we're looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything. And I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy\nThank you so much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n(Operator Instructions)\nKash Rangan\nOkay, great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly. The one congrats Bill. First of all. Secondly, that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously? Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long term contracts. What's driving that? nd finally, congratulations on hiring. I think is going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono\nSo I'll start first on the strength of our RPO what it, repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only are our the portfolio of products getting larger and the deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer and that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth.\nWe have really strong cRPO but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter after quarter. And that's test to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers and so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the Board. And that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO but our RPO number, which is a really strong long term measure of the health of our business.\nBill McDermott\nAnd I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it RaptorDB the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster and think about bringing next generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers.\nSo the performance, the speed, the scale as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts the platform buying his is you know, quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations, and speed of execution.\nSo all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks. And we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an up sell opportunity for every existing installation across the world, the ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that people will invest in. But it will be well worth it for the benefits that they're going to get from it.\nAnd this will be an ongoing story as we continue to to build it out. But remember one thing, it's it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that in a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass, no other company in the world could do that.\nAnd we believe that that will give us a very exciting position for future growth and we're super excited and we're rolling it out now in Q4. And we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan\nThank you so much. It sounds really truely.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks Kash.\nOperator\nKeith Weiss, Morgan Stanley\nKeith Weiss\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. One question for Gina. One question for Bill. Gina last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwinds that came from the strong federal business last year given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year, I'm assuming those duration bene or headwinds don't exist in Q3.\nSo is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill, agents kind of came onto the scene in, in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents.\nDoes that change like the sales cycle at all about for like now assist and the pro plus KW. Now that there's this new sort of technology, people are talking about in terms of agents or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does if you're not yet a ServiceNow, customer or you're thinking about now, is just it further your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future.\nSo not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another up sell opportunity. And we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve and almost any task you could possibly think of.\nAnd these partnerships that we've established, with great companies like NVIDIA and building market making solutions. For example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out of the box type solution, I think is really pretty breathtaking and at an architectural level we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model.\nSo this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster but also integrate better. As I said, many times 85% of Digital Transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now, everything integrates into one platform and you turbo charge it with now assist in Agentic A I and, and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono\nAnd then Keith on your question on duration for cRPO from fed the mix, we, we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as fed kind of re-ups. But then you will see continued headwind quarter over quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss\nYeah, so like on the duration adjusted basis, it Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono\nThat's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss\nOkay, perfect.\nGina Mastantuono\nThanks, Keith.\nOperator\nBrad Sills, Bank of America.\nBrad Sills\nOh, great. Thank you so much. A question on head count here as well. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount out pace sales and marketing historically, that was the opposite. And and it looks pretty pretty significant here by almost, you know, 2 to 1 ratio there.\nSo I guess the question is, what does that say about the business is the gating factor to growth here really? Just about your ability to get out more product and categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono\nYeah, I, I say it, it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quarter bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter bearing sales at a really strong way.\nThere's lots of marketing and sales operations head count that we were building up as we were scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear and I have, I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing head count was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things with respect to R&D head count, it's been pretty consistent.\nIt's always been an area of huge focus for us and certainly in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that has consistently been a place where we have invested and will continue to invest. And so from our perspective, head count growth is always first and foremost allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent, as well as feet on the street quarter bearing sales hitting the road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest fraught problems. And you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills\nWonderful. Thanks, Gina.\nBill McDermott\nThanks, Brad.\nOperator\nMichael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin\nHey, great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Know the numbers can bounce around a bit, but we've seen and heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV. Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks.\nSo I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us and maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong and we grew net new ACV, over 50% -- 50%. And it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued traction in the front office has been going on for some time now. But we're getting known for it and we're winning, we're winning a lot.\nSo it's a healthy adoption of our Pro plus offering the industry SKUs the driving things, financial services was out in front for sure. Technology and media, absolutely, public sector, technology and media was over 300%, public sector grew over 60%.\nAnd in the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at. It's really amazing from managed service providers to manufacturing semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies, it's extremely, extremely exciting.\nAnd I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity just think about reduced time to quote a higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero touch, provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin\nSo very clear. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott\nThank you.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the, the Federal Business partly because of the issues that you and Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft.\nI'm wondering if you could hit that, hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good fed bookings over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, sure, Karl, we didn't see any impact in Q3 and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the US Federal Business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And you know, as I look at the business and fed it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic.\nWe have five deals, greater than $5 million, a couple of deals over $20 million and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. And that's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind.\nI know because I've been there with the US federal government agencies. They're looking for efficiency gains and they know our software platform does it, they also know the implementations of stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our calling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive.\nIt's all working for us and I'm very, very excited about our GenAI SKUs for our government community cloud as you know, that went generally available recently was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal and we partnered with Accenture as a matter of fact to kick off a 60 day pilot with one agency and they ended it early to get into the GenAI race because it works so well. So everything is a thumbs up here, Karl and I, I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nAll right. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the growth for analysis and Pro-plus has obviously been highly impressive, but we've also been hearing about a real uptick in customers choosing to upgrade from standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards adoption and obviously that drives in our uplift as well.\nSo, you know, Bill when you look across your install base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with the set of customers going forward?\nBill McDermott\nAbsolutely, I do Greg. I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you, when you can now add the now assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink because the returns to them is so much greater than any pricing and we're very fair company in the way we do things and it's highly transparent.\nI see a plus up with that, I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally. Because it's such a sensation, people see the clock speed of how the system runs on it. They all want it and Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic, great engineering built into it, amazing. We really hit it with our database and our -- I would say first round draft choice team that built this it's really something to behold.\nSo I am feeling extremely good and the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door. CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow. And they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoints, it's real products, doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited Greg.\nGregg Moskowitz\nFantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nDerek Lessard, TD Cowen.\nDerek Lessard\nThanks. Bill. Really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents. Just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these agentic networks. It sounds like it's technology from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, Zero Copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LLMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming in [GA]?\nBill McDermott\nYes, sure. Well, first of all on, I think there's really three areas that I I would highlight for you that are my top three if that helps, just put this into some context. The GenAI race is one that we're winning first mover and we intend to run the table. So now assist is a sensation and GenAI on the now platform because of the uniqueness of this platform and it's perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB, it really is magnificent.\nNow you put RaptorDB. So you know now assist is priority one. You put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform again, if that workflow data platform which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform.\nWhat customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise for structured or unstructured data to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I'll literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest town and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that that can be like a major catalyst.\nAnd in terms of when the products are coming, they're out. So you got now assist in full flight, you've got wrap RaptorDB in full flight Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now and it'll continue to evolve and be a big part of our future. And you have the front office where wins are happening every day.\nAnd we're beautifully led there and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the cross sells and the cohorts that Gina talked about and there's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start up.\nAnd that's kind of the emotion that's running through ServiceNow now and tomorrow when we get to ServiceNow live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter. I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Lessard\nFantastic. Thanks.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow\nThanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talk with a lot of like [C-suite] level executives. How do we think about like AI and as we go into next year in terms of, is that like coming out of the it budget? Do you do a second budget, and how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott\nYeah, I, I think the good news, the really good news here, Raimo is it budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And you know, we we really work hard on studying the world around us, and Gartner expects global it spending to grow almost a 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023 and it expects software to grow at 15%.\nAnd the secular tailwinds of Gen AI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers are focused on digital transformation within the IT budget, it's growing, we're gaining more share because clearly we're gaining share, because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about.\nAnd we're gaining share, but I also think there's new share to be gained from more investment. And I really believe when I talk to the CEOs IT is clearly their business focus within IT GenAI is their number one focus and they are going to get the money from somewhere and if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will.\nSo on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around GenAI, and also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where's the new money coming from? Well, we had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250 point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache.\nBut there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future, and the future is now so now no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow.\nIT but other line item budgets coming in and of course the consolidation to a premier partner -- premier platform like this incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly and we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels, and how the channels are now leaning in.\nAnd building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all of that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow\nYeah. Okay, perfect. That's really clear. Thank you, congrats.\nBill McDermott\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana\nGreat. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that it has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about kind of this big AI boom period for ServiceNow and related just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and joins, how they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nBill McDermott\nThat's a really great question Samad. You know how I learned about that was actually in a live interview with it and we talked about his past and everything that he's done and he called that out as a unique professional I guess strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done. And I see that as a skill that'll help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at and that's what you always try to do.\nYou always try to hire great human beings first of all, and he is one with a hungry and humble heart. He has one, but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way, in terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer.\nWe need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, builds camaraderie with the best engineering team in the business which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens which he has from all of his experiences.\nSo I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring a mid on and we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places including Oracle and obviously Google with the Google cloud platform.\nAnd as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual. It's also good for the company he came from, and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of it and the conversation that we had, it was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good, and we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana\nExciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nBill McDermott\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Bye, bye. Thanking you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"
