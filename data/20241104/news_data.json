(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss.\nArtificial Intelligence is a game changer. According to a PwC report, it could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity while $9.1 trillion is from consumption-side effects. The report also reveals that global GDP will be up to 14% higher in 2030 due to the accelerating development of AI. The greatest productivity gains are likely to go to North America and China, with the former expected to realize the AI benefits faster.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\nHowever, the surge in artificial intelligence will require a huge number of data centers, and it is significantly going to impact how much the world consumes power, and how much that is going to cost. To have an idea, on average, a ChatGPT search needs as much as 10 times more electricity to process as a Google search. That said, AI gathering steam is only going to make the power hunger crazier. According to estimates from Goldman Sachs, the data center demand is going to grow 160% by 2030. Presently, data centers consume about 1-2% of overall power, but the percentage is likely to rise to 3-4% by the end of the decade.\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAs we examine the increasing energy demand of data centers stemming from the surge in AI, it\u2019s worth noting how these advancements are manifesting in practical applications. In its latest breakthrough, Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company that builds reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems, has launched Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u2014their first release in the forthcoming Claude 3.5 model family. The Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency (HumanEval), demonstrating marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural and relatable tone.\nAnother exciting news is how Runway, an AI company shaping the next era of art, entertainment, and human creativity, has launched a new set of advanced AI camera controls for its Gen-3 Alpha Turbo video generation model. These tools allow the user generating videos from text prompts, upload images, or even their footage, to have greater control over the AI-generated settings and characters. Users can even zoom in or out of the scene and subjects without disrupting their realism, creating a more immersive experience of a seemingly 3D world.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, a highly anticipated release that many have been waiting on is seemingly delayed, as per the latest reports. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that his company\u2019s next big model won\u2019t likely be released this year. According to Altman, the company is \"prioritizing\" shipping existing models focused on reasoning and difficult questions.\n\u201cAll of these models have gotten quite complex and we can\u2019t ship as many things in parallel as we\u2019d like to\u201d. He said the company faces \u201climitations and hard decisions\u201d when it comes to allocating compute resources \u201ctowards many great ideas.\u201d - Altman wrote during a Reddit AMA.\nWhen asked about the release of ChatGPT-5, Altman stated that the company has some very good releases this year but \u201cnothing that we are going to call GPT-5.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The proposed rule, however, is meant to restrict data transfers overseas and increase government access to information, possibly complicating operations for overseas technology companies.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nThough these words are still vague, the lawnow under parliamentary reviewwould need businesses to get prior permission to export \"core data\" and \"important data\" abroad. Chair of the Information Technology Industry Council Jason Oxman, representing companies including Meta, Alphabet's Google (GOOGL, Financials), and Equinix (EQIX, Financials), said the measure \"would make it difficult for tech companies, social media platforms, and data center operators to reach the users who rely on their services daily.\"\nThough enforcement has been erratic, Vietnam's current regulations restrict cross-border data flows in particular circumstances. The proposed bill would increase these restrictions, mandating businesses to provide data to government and state entities in a spectrum of broadly defined scenarios, such as completing duties judged in the public interest.\nThough the timetable may alter, Vietnamese legislators are supposed to vote on the measure by Nov. 30, Reuters said. Should it be approved, the bill would bring Vietnam into step with nations such as China and the European Union, which limit cross-border data flows to improve data security and privacy.\nCiting the dangers of \"undue expansion\" of control, the U.S. IT industry has strongly objected to the law's possibility for more government data access. With reports in August showing Google is considering building a data center in Vietnaman investment that would be the first by a significant U.S. tech business in the nation Vietnam is now assessing proposals from big American tech players.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "An investor dubbed the \u201cFrench whale\u201d has sparked fascination with his lavish bets on the outcome of this year\u2019s US presidential election. Fredi9999, as one of his accounts is known, is wagering at least $30 million that Donald Trump will win in the Polymarket prediction market.\nThat\u2019s peanuts compared with what may be the biggest bet of all on the 2024 election, which is what Trump himself stands to gain \u2014 or lose. Through his ownership stake in Trump Media and Technology Group, the stakes for Trump amount to at least $4 billion, which is more than all the presidential election bets on Polymarket combined.\nTrump Media, known by its ticker symbol, DJT, is broadly viewed as the one financial asset serving as a binary bet on whether Trump wins or loses the presidential race. If Trump wins, DJT, which houses the Truth Social networking app, could gain a surge of users and revenue, making it a viable social media network able to compete with the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook. But if Trump loses, DJT\u2019s already weak financials could erode further, threatening the whole business. Some investors think the stock could go to 0, imperiling the company.\nShares of DJT have been wildly volatile during the last two months, surging or crashing based on market perceptions of whether Trump is likely to win. There\u2019s a tight correlation between Trump\u2019s odds in betting markets and the direction of DJT shares.\nIn mid-September, for instance, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris pulled ahead of Trump in betting markets. DJT shares sank and closed September at $12.15, the lowest level since the company went public back in March.\nThen Trump\u2019s election odds improved, hitting 64% in the Real Clear Politics aggregate on Oct. 29. On the same day, DJT closed at $51.51, a 324% gain from its September low. There was no company news during that time indicating any sort of improvement in the company\u2019s financial or operating performance, which is weak.\nDuring the last few days, Trump\u2019s election odds have fallen to around 55%, while DJT shares have slipped to about $31. Polls show the two candidates are essentially tied, with Harris possibly benefiting from a wisp of last-second momentum.\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump is reflected in the bullet proof glass as he finishes speaking at a campaign rally in Lititz, Pa., Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nTrump owns 57% of DJT, and the value of his stake has yoyo-ed in proportion to the stock price and his election odds. In July, before Harris replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, DJT\u2019s market value was around $7.7 billion, putting the value of Trump\u2019s portion at about $4.4 billion. At its low point in September, DJT was worth $2.4 billion, with Trump\u2019s share at $1.4 billion. After the October surge, DJT was worth $10 billion, and Trump\u2019s share $5.7 billion.\nStory Continues\nSo from the September bottom to the October top, the value of Trump\u2019s shares varied by $4.3 billion. That\u2019s probably the minimum loss Trump would suffer if he loses the election, because that swing is based on a minimum DJT price of $12.15. If the stock goes to 0, Trump\u2019s losses from peak to trough would be $5.7 billion, the value of his shares as of Oct. 29.\n\u2022 USD\n(DJT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMany investors have been placing \u201cTrump trades\u201d on assets they think will do better or worse if Trump gets elected, including buying DJT stock outright or buying options that could pay off based on future movements in the stock price. Other Trump trades include cryptocurrency, private prisons, and gold. But it\u2019s hard to imagine any single investor other than Trump could have more than $5 billion riding on the election outcome, making Trump the ultimate election whale.\nTrump would not be losing $5.7 billion that he actually invested in the company. Trump made little or no financial investment in DJT, instead adding to its value through his personal brand and the attention he\u2019s able to bring to its main product, Truth Social. Other investors plowed about $1 billion into the company in its startup phase, however, and they\u2019d lose much of their principal if the stock collapses. If DJT does crater, the company could still operate as a non-public company if somebody bought it or its owners chose to take it private.\nTrump would still take a massive financial hit if he loses the election and DJT craters. In late October, with DJT near its peak, Bloomberg estimated Trump\u2019s net worth to be around $6.6 billion, and most of that was his stake in DJT. Without that stake, Trump\u2019s net worth might be around $1 billion. That\u2019s obviously a lot, but much of his wealth is illiquid, and if defeated, Trump would face heavy claims on his wealth long into the future.\nTrump is already on the hook for an $83.3 million judgment against him in the E. Jean. Carroll defamation case and for $454 million in a New York fraud trial. Those payments are on pause as Trump appeals them. Trump is still entangled in three criminal cases that could drag on for years as legal bills pile up. Two of those cases are federal cases Trump could have dismissed if he wins the White House \u2014 but will likely have to keep fighting if he loses. The third is a Fulton County, Ga., case that Trump can\u2019t close down even if he\u2019s president.\nIf Trump loses, he would also endure reputational damage as a 78-year-old two-time presidential loser with no obvious next move. Trump stokes his fame, branding power, and fundraising ability by constantly staying in the news and frequently delighting his followers. If he fades into the background, all of that fades with him. All told, it could mark the greatest financial stake ever in the outcome of a presidential election.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nMeta Platforms (META) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this social media company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 50.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 28.4%.\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.58, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 20.8% this year versus the industry average of 7.8%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nMeta Platforms has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Cramer remarked that when grading these results, investors seek clarity and simplicity, wanting reports that are easy to understand rather than muddled and confusing.\nLast Wednesday, Cramer posed a thought-provoking question, noting that while stocks have the potential to generate substantial profits, the recent earnings reports have made it clear that not all results are straightforward.\n\u201cStocks can make you a lot of money, can't they? But after another day full of earnings where the Dow fell 92 points, S&P dipped 0.33% and Nasdaq declined 0.56%, it is worth remembering that most of these quarterly report cards aren't that clean, not that simple.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nCramer likened the reporting process to navigating a complicated landscape where quick, headline-driven summaries often fail to capture essential nuances, which can lead to significant misunderstandings and even crises in interpretation.\nHe explained that many companies faced a series of challenges in their earnings reports, asserting that every disappointing quarter has its unique characteristics, complicating the assessment process. Cramer illustrated this by comparing the situation to a criminal trial, where a defendant who is clearly guilty but refuses a plea deal might face severe consequences. He emphasized that for CEOs, acknowledging mistakes is crucial; failing to address poor results could lead to a perception that they do not take the reporting process seriously.\n\u201cBottom line, memo to CEOs everywhere: each gutter ball, every strike out, must be explained or we\u2019ll be concerned that you simply don\u2019t take the process seriously. If you don\u2019t want to face the music, then you need to give us the happy family of good results and a sunny forecast. When you can't do that, you at least need to straightforwardly admit that you were wrong.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on October 30. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nCramer delved into Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) third-quarter earnings report that was released on October 30. Here\u2019s what he had to say about it:\n\u201cMeta stock instantly plunged about 20 bucks when it reported because there was no beat and raise lingo. Remember we like that stuff spoon-fed because we're lazy. I had to bat this one around for a while with the crew because there are puts and takes to the guidance. That's another technical term, puts and takes\u2026 And I still can't be sure that it should be down so much. It's coining money for heaven's sake. Again, hard to pin down. A non-beaten, non raiser that made the numbers.\u201d\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a global leader in connecting people through a variety of products that allow for sharing and interaction on mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables. The company boasts an audience of 3.29 billion daily active users across its platforms. The majority of its revenue comes from selling advertising space to businesses looking to reach this extensive audience. As users engage more with platforms like Facebook and Instagram, the number of advertisements they encounter increases, driving revenue growth.\nIn Q3, Meta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) advertising revenue climbed nearly 19%, totaling $39.9 billion. The company has projected its fourth-quarter revenue between $45 billion and $48 billion. Additionally, a notable rise in capital expenditures is expected in 2025, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of investing in artificial intelligence and infrastructure for future growth.\nManagement mentioned that AI plays a crucial role in boosting user engagement and time spent on its platforms, while also providing tools for advertisers to improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and boost conversion rates. The company highlighted advancements in its Llama large language model, which has seen significant growth in tokens, aiding in AI computations. Training for Llama 4 is currently underway, utilizing a cluster that is bigger than 100,000 H100 graphic processing units.\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Those nations have an intelligence-sharing partnership known as Five Eyes.\nIsrael, the closest US ally in the Middle East, was not included on the current list of partners.\nThe move comes on the eve of the US election and at a time when Meta faces some concerns about the potential of developers in countries like China to use Llama for military applications.\nLarge language models are the foundation of the current AI boom and can be used for a variety of services, including powering chatbots. In the world of defense and security, Llama could help with tasks like data analysis and synthesizing documents, or to \u201ctrack terrorist financing or strengthen our cyber defenses,\u201d Clegg wrote.\nMeta will not have a say in how US agencies or its partners use the Llama technology, but a Meta spokesperson said via email that \u201cit is the responsibility of countries leveraging AI for national security to deploy AI ethically, responsibly, and in accordance with relevant international law.\u201d\nStory Continues\nMeta\u2019s motivation to work with US defense agencies is driven in part by its intention to further establish Llama as a dominant foundation for AI products globally. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg made Llama open source because he wants to have more control over the next major technological wave \u2014 a strategy that only works if Meta\u2019s technology is ubiquitous.\nOn an earnings call last week, Zuckerberg said he was trying to get \u201cthe public sector to adopt Llama across the US government.\u201d The latest update could help with that goal and also pave the way for Zuckerberg to further develop relationships with elected officials.\nMeta has been criticized over the years for its role in policing user speech and an alleged failure to protect young people online. Former President Donald Trump has taken several shots at Zuckerberg in recent months, even suggesting he might try and put the Meta founder in jail if he is re-elected to the White House.\nMeta is also framing its decision to work with US defense agencies as a way of preventing US adversaries, like China, from gaining ground. \u201cWe believe it is in both America and the wider democratic world\u2019s interest for American open source models to excel and succeed over models from China and elsewhere,\u201d Clegg wrote.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Meta Platforms (META) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.39, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 49 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.39 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 49 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 41 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.7% and 2% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for META\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for META\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Meta Platforms, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nShould You Invest in META?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.1% over the past month to $22.44.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms.

Courtyards\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nMuddling the Message Around \u2018Climate Havens\u2019\nWith a proprietary software tool it calls an \u201cadult classifier,\u201d Meta will categorize users into two age brackets \u2014 older or younger than 18 \u2014 based on the person\u2019s own account data, according to Allison Hartnett, Meta\u2019s director of product management for youth and social impact. The software can sift through a user\u2019s profile, see their follower list and what content they interact with, and will even scan unsuspecting \u201chappy birthday\u201d posts made by friends to predict a user\u2019s age.\nBased on the software\u2019s findings, people who are suspected to be under 18 will be automatically placed into teen accounts regardless of how old they claim to be on their profile, Hartnett said, sharing more details on the process for the first time. In September, Instagram introduced these new teen accounts, which come with more stringent default privacy settings, like limiting who a user can receive messages from and what types of content they can look at. The company didn\u2019t disclose how accurate the adult classifier is.\nThe company is already moving teens into these more restrictive settings based on their self-reported birthday, but plans to utilize the adult classifier early next year to help catch people who may be trying to skirt the new rules. All users under 18 will be automatically herded into teen accounts, but those who are 16 or 17 will be allowed to change the more restrictive privacy settings on their own. Anyone younger than 16, however, needs parental consent to disable the more restrictive settings.\nProperly protecting teenage users from harmful content has been a challenge for Meta for years. The company\u2019s move toward teen accounts was applauded by outsiders who have long argued that Meta wasn\u2019t doing enough to keep younger users safe online.\nThe social networking giant is facing a lawsuit from dozens of state attorneys general alleging the company knowingly hooked kids on social media and helped create a teen mental health crisis. It\u2019s also been the target of parents who allege their teens have died from drugs or suicide due to content they\u2019ve seen or conversations they\u2019ve had using Meta\u2019s products.\nStory Continues\nIn 2021, Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen released thousands of pages of documents to the media that showed that, among other things, the company\u2019s own research found Instagram could have a negative mental health impact on teenage girls.\nWith the new restrictions in place, Meta\u2019s challenge now is enforcing them \u2014 no small task considering kids often find work-arounds to access age-restricted material. A study by the UK\u2019s telecommunications regulator found that a third of minors with social media accounts declare their age to be 18 or above.\nOn many sites across the internet, lying about one\u2019s age is extremely simple. Steam, an online video game marketplace, simply asks users to self-report a birth date before viewing and downloading a mature-rated game. Other sites that sell alcohol, for example, just ask users to click a button verifying they\u2019re over 21.\nMeta aims to make it much harder to lie about your age on Instagram. For example, the company will flag teens who try to create a new account using the same email address but with a different birthday. The company can also check a phone\u2019s unique device ID to guess who is behind a new profile.\nSee More: Instagram Rolls Out Restrictive New Privacy Settings for Teenagers\nTeens who try to manually increase the age listed on their account will have to prove themselves by uploading formal identification, like a driver\u2019s license, or by sending in a video-selfie to Yoti, a third-party service that can estimate age based on facial features. Yoti and Meta then delete the images after verification. Users could previously verify their age by having friends vouch for them, but that option has been eliminated, Meta said.\nPeople who have been wrongly categorized as teenagers may eventually be able to appeal to the company to remove their teen account status, a spokesperson said, though that process is still under development. For now, while Meta works on improving the accuracy of its adult classifier, people wrongly predicted to be teens can manually turn them off without parental permission.\nMeta\u2019s approach to age verification is made possible by the vast troves of information people share about themselves on the app, including their social circles, hobbies and content preferences. Instagram\u2019s teen accounts are still being rolled out in the US and several other countries, but so far, Hartnett says that teens lying about their age has been less of a problem than the company expected.\nDespite Meta\u2019s efforts, Hartnett and other executives argue that the most privacy-preserving age verification process of all would involve app stores verifying a teen\u2019s age before they can even download certain apps. A spokesperson for Apple Inc. said that such an approach would violate the principle of data minimization, while a spokesperson for Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google said there isn\u2019t a \u201csingle solution\u201d to the problem.\nBut shifting the burden of age verification to Google Play or Apple\u2019s App Store \u201cassumes that the app store has the ground truth,\u201d Michael Smith, a computer science professor who teaches a data privacy course at Harvard University, said in an email. That\u2019s not solving the problem of whether or not the person has been honest from the beginning. \u201cAren\u2019t Meta\u2019s problems with age verification simply being moved to the app stores?\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

According to a PwC report, it could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity while $9.1 trillion is from consumption-side effects. The report also reveals that global GDP will be up to 14% higher in 2030 due to the accelerating development of AI. The greatest productivity gains are likely to go to North America and China, with the former expected to realize the AI benefits faster.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\nHowever, the surge in artificial intelligence will require a huge number of data centers, and it is significantly going to impact how much the world consumes power, and how much that is going to cost. To have an idea, on average, a ChatGPT search needs as much as 10 times more electricity to process as a Google search. That said, AI gathering steam is only going to make the power hunger crazier. According to estimates from Goldman Sachs, the data center demand is going to grow 160% by 2030. Presently, data centers consume about 1-2% of overall power, but the percentage is likely to rise to 3-4% by the end of the decade.\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAs we examine the increasing energy demand of data centers stemming from the surge in AI, it\u2019s worth noting how these advancements are manifesting in practical applications.

The Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency (HumanEval), demonstrating marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural and relatable tone.\nAnother exciting news is how Runway, an AI company shaping the next era of art, entertainment, and human creativity, has launched a new set of advanced AI camera controls for its Gen-3 Alpha Turbo video generation model. These tools allow the user generating videos from text prompts, upload images, or even their footage, to have greater control over the AI-generated settings and characters. Users can even zoom in or out of the scene and subjects without disrupting their realism, creating a more immersive experience of a seemingly 3D world.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, a highly anticipated release that many have been waiting on is seemingly delayed, as per the latest reports. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that his company\u2019s next big model won\u2019t likely be released this year. According to Altman, the company is \"prioritizing\" shipping existing models focused on reasoning and difficult questions.\n\u201cAll of these models have gotten quite complex and we can\u2019t ship as many things in parallel as we\u2019d like to\u201d. He said the company faces \u201climitations and hard decisions\u201d when it comes to allocating compute resources \u201ctowards many great ideas.\u201d - Altman wrote during a Reddit AMA.\nWhen asked about the release of ChatGPT-5, Altman stated that the company has some very good releases this year but \u201cnothing that we are going to call GPT-5.\u201d\nNow, let's take a look at the 10 latest developments in AI that investors should not miss.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Maintains Buy Rating as Rosenblatt Raises Price Target; Optimism Grows for Apple Intelligence\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American technology company engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide. The company integrates artificial intelligence in many of its popular features, such as Siri, and Face ID, and has also recently launched Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s personal intelligence system.\nRosenblatt raised the price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $262 from $261 and kept a \"Buy\" rating on the shares. According to the analyst, Apple's fiscal Q4 earnings report demonstrated strength in iPhone sales, even though the December quarter guidance came in slightly below expectations. However, there remains a strong sense of long-term optimism for Apple Intelligence. Overall, the firm says its estimates have seen minimal adjustments following the report.\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Courtyards\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nMuddling the Message Around \u2018Climate Havens\u2019\nThe plan would involve Apple investing in a factory in Bandung, southeast of Jakarta, in partnership with its list of suppliers, the people said, asking not to be identified because they\u2019re not authorized to speak publicly. The facility would make products such as accessories and components for Apple gadgets, the people said.\nApple has submitted its proposal to the nation\u2019s Ministry of Industry, which last month blocked a permit allowing the sale of the iPhone 16 on grounds the US tech giant\u2019s local unit hasn\u2019t met a 40% domestic content requirement for smartphones and tablets.\nThe ministry is deliberating on the proposal, which isn\u2019t final and may be subject to change, and is expected to reach a decision shortly, the people said.\nApple didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The Ministry of Industry also didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nIndonesia\u2019s iPhone 16 ban is the latest example of the pressure new President Prabowo Subianto\u2019s government is putting on international companies to boost local manufacturing as it seeks to protect domestic industries. The Southeast Asian nation has also banned the sale of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Pixel phones because of a similar lack of investment.\nThe moves are a continuation of similar tactics used under former President Joko Widodo\u2019s administration. Last year, Indonesia blocked China\u2019s ByteDance Ltd. in a bid to shield its retail sector from cheap Chinese-made goods, prompting the hugely popular video service to ultimately invest $1.5 billion in a joint venture with Tokopedia, the e-commerce arm of Indonesia\u2019s GoTo Group.\nApple doesn\u2019t have any standalone factories in Indonesia and like most multinationals, partners with locally based suppliers to make components or finished goods. An investment of close to $10 million would be a relatively small price for Apple to pay for freer access to Indonesia\u2019s some 278 million consumers \u2014 more than half of them under the age of 44 and tech savvy.\nWhile Indonesia may view Apple\u2019s additional investment \u2014 should it transpire \u2014 as a win, its strong arm approach risks deterring other companies from scaling up their presence or establishing a footprint in the first place, particularly firms that are looking to pivot away from China. It may also jeopardize Prabowo\u2019s aim of attracting overseas investments to grow the economy and fund policy spending.\nStory Continues\nAccording to the Indonesian government, Apple has only invested 1.5 trillion rupiah ($95 million) in the nation via developer academies, falling short of its commitment of 1.7 trillion rupiah. Officials have also requested that e-commerce players Tokopedia and TikTok take down iPhone 16 sellers on their platforms, or risk legal action.\nIndonesia has exhibited haphazard trade policies before.\nEarlier this year, the government imposed import curbs on thousands of products \u2014 from Macbooks to tires to chemicals \u2014 to force foreign companies to scale up manufacturing. But the move ignited a furore among the business community, including players with a long-established manufacturing presence in the country such as LG Electronics Inc., which complained it couldn\u2019t import certain components to make washing machines and televisions.\nDespite Indonesia\u2019s repeated calls for international companies to boost manufacturing, its local industry is languishing. Manufacturing as a proportion of gross domestic product slipped to 18.7% last year from 21.1% in 2014.\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Courtyards\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nMuddling the Message Around \u2018Climate Havens\u2019\nThe initiative, code-named Atlas, got underway last week and involves gathering feedback from Apple employees on smart glasses, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Additional focus groups are planned for the near future, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is secret. The studies are being led by Apple\u2019s Product Systems Quality team, part of the hardware engineering division.\n\u201cTesting and developing products that all can come to love is very important to what we do at Apple,\u201d the group wrote in an email to select employees at the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California. \u201cThis is why we are looking for participants to join us in an upcoming user study with current market smart glasses.\u201d\nWhen Apple is considering whether to enter a new category, it often hosts secret focus groups to understand what people like about existing products. The company typically relies on employees \u2014 rather than customers \u2014 so it can avoid making its plans public. A representative for Apple declined to comment.\nLast month, Bloomberg News reported on another internal study: The company tested an app for people with prediabetes that tracks their blood-sugar changes and diet.\nThe latest study suggests that Apple is moving forward with its own work on smart glasses. Bloomberg previously reported that the iPhone maker has been considering a foray into the market \u2014 potentially challenging Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban device \u2014 though an actual product would still be years away.\nThe research will likely guide Apple in what features to include in its own glasses and help identify ways the technology could be used.\nCreating a successful face-worn device has been a challenge. Apple\u2019s $3,499 Vision Pro headset, released in February, is seen as too cumbersome and expensive to become a mainstream product.\nFor years, Apple had sought to make a lighter-weight augmented reality version of the device \u2014 something that could be worn all day and potentially replace the iPhone. Work on that project has sputtered due to numerous technical challenges.\nStory Continues\nMeta, meanwhile, found success with a more stripped-down formula. Its $299 glasses, created in partnership with Luxottica Group SpA, aren\u2019t true AR spectacles \u2014 they don\u2019t overlay information on the glass. But they let users shoot video, take phone calls and ask questions to an AI assistant.\nNow Apple is looking to create something similar. Its approach could involve making smart glasses that work like its already-popular AirPods earbuds. A version in glasses form would allow for more battery life, sensors and improved audio technology.\nBut Apple\u2019s rivals are moving forward as well. In recent months, Meta and Snap Inc. both previewed AR glasses \u2014 models that can blend the real world with digital overlays of games, text messages and apps. Neither product will be ready for consumers for at least a few years, though. The current prototypes are more about getting app developers to buy into the concept.\nApple also plans to revamp the Vision Pro headset to broaden its appeal. The device is exceptional for watching videos and doing office work, but its weight, high price and limited content have made it a niche product.\nThe company has been working on a lower-end version with less expensive components. It\u2019s even considered building a device that offloads many of the features and computing processing to an iPhone, allowing the headset to become more of an accessory to products that consumers already own.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

This decline implies that Berkshire cut its Apple ownership by around 100 million shares, therefore lowering its position to roughly 300 million sharesa drop of almost 25%.\nLikewise, Berkshire's ownership in Bank of America dropped; the fair value dropped to $31.7 billion at the end of Q3 from $41.1 billion in Q2.

Courtyards\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nMuddling the Message Around \u2018Climate Havens\u2019\nAfter a blistering artificial intelligence-driven rally of more than 140% this year, the bar is high. Wall Street has become increasingly cautious about Palantir, with the average target implying a decline of more than 30% in the next 12 months. At the same time, investors are still wary about AI-linked names, and want to see more tangible results from the nascent technology. Earnings from Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. were met with mixed reactions.\n\u201cWe cannot rationalize why Palantir is the most expensive name in software,\u201d RBC analysts led by Rishi Jaluria wrote in a note last week. The stock trades at more than 100 times future earnings, while Oracle Corp. and Microsoft both trade at less than 30 times. Palantir shares were about 0.6% lower in afternoon trading in New York.\n\u201cAbsent a substantial beat-and-raise quarter elevating the near-term growth trajectory, valuation seems unsustainable,\u201d Jaluria said. RBC has an underperform rating and $9 price target for Palantir \u2014 about 80% lower than the current price.\nBullish investors see it differently, helping to push the stock to a record high last month. The company, which makes just over half of its revenue from government contracts, got a boost from its recent inclusion in the S&P 500, and is now the third-best performer in that benchmark in 2024 \u2014 trailing only Vistra Corp. and Nvidia Corp.\nPalantir is \u201cone of the few companies that is Gen AI enabled and has actually seen upticks both in the enterprise and government sector,\u201d said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W Baird & Co. \u201cThe Street is just missing, quite frankly, how powerful their core AI-based platform is.\u201d\nPalantir is expected to report third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 9 cents, up 29% from a year ago, but a slower pace of growth than in previous quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue is estimated at about $704 million, up 26% year-over-year.\nInvestors will be particularly focused on customer additions and sales of AI tools to corporate customers. Wall Street estimates revenue from government clients will grow 23%, to nearly $379 million, while commercial sales are expected to increase by about 32%, to $330 million. Palantir has won multiple new corporate clients this year, including CBS Broadcasting, General Mills Inc. and Aramark Services Inc.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotta continue to see that momentum,\u201d in commercial contracts, said Mortonson.\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager at Equity Armor Investments LLC, is also focused on this metric. \u201cThey have really big name contracts, but they are really just scratching the surface in terms of the types of customers they can reach,\u201d he said.\nRBC\u2019s Jaluria, on the other hand, is skeptical that Palantir can keep up the pace of commercial sector wins, given high levels of competition and considering the suitability of Palantir\u2019s products outside of large, non-technical businesses.\nThe RBC analysts also note Palantir\u2019s rally has been helped by a high proportion of retail investors \u2014 a crowd that could sour on the stock quickly, especially if the company doesn\u2019t start returning meaningful capital to investors. Palantir doesn\u2019t offer a dividend and, as of June 30, had $973.3 million of a total authorized $1 billion stock repurchase program available.\n\u201cWith Palantir\u2019s $4 billion cash balance, we think retail investors may be starting to become frustrated (rightfully so) by the company\u2019s lack of willingness to return capital to shareholders given no apparent interest in pursuing M&A opportunities,\u201d Jaluria wrote.\nTech Chart of the Day\nNvidia Corp. is threatening to reclaim the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company from iPhone maker Apple Inc. The chipmaker\u2019s shares are higher on Monday after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday that Nvidia will replace rival Intel Corp. in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meanwhile, Apple shares are lower after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway continued to sell the company\u2019s stock in the third quarter. The spread between the two tech behemoths was about $50 billion as of Friday\u2019s close.\nTop Tech Stories\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc.\u2019s continued sales of Apple shares in the third quarter left the conglomerate\u2019s stake at a fraction of its size at the start of the year.\nNvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the artificial intelligence boom, is joining the oldest of Wall Street\u2019s three main equity benchmarks.\nApple agreed to buy software maker Pixelmator, adding a popular high-end photo-editing app to its lineup.\nElon Musk was dealt a significant setback in a court fight over compensation sought by the top Twitter Inc. executives he fired when he took over the company in 2022.\nThe online dating service Bumble misled shareholders through overly optimistic revenue and other financial metrics projections, a new complaint filed by an investor alleges.\nEarnings Due Monday\nPremarket\nEntegris\nDigitalOcean\nEnfusion\nFox Corp\nNew York Times Co.\nEW Scripps\nPostmarket\nPalantir\nNXP Semi\nAspenTech\nFabrinet\nLattice Semi\nCirrus Logic\nSanmina\nSilicon Labs\nTeradata\nAlpha & Omega Semi\nIchor\n8x8\nAltice USA\nQuinStreet\nVimeo\nWideOpenWest\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Rheaa Rao.\n(Updates stock moves.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $256.\nThe rerating reflects the expected strong iPhone upgrade cycle in fiscal 2025 and 2026, driven by the need for the latest hardware to enable Gen AI features, higher growth in Services revenue, higher margins from more internally developed silicon, continuing capital returns, and AI features that can drive higher institutional ownership.\nThe price target is based on approximately 30 times Mohan\u2019s calendar 2026 EPS of $8.47.\nAlso Read: Apple\u2019s Q3 Smartphone Sales Slip Despite Strong iPhone 16 Demand, Market Share Dropped Slightly\nThe target multiple compares to the 5-year historical range of 16-34 times (median 27 times). He noted that a multiple at the higher end of the historical range is justified given a multi-year upgrade cycle, large cash balance, and opportunity to diversify into new end markets and increase the mix and diversity of services.\nThe analyst cited SensorTower data, App Store revenues in the first quarter (after 33 days) rose to $2.9 billion (up 14.5% Y/Y), with total iPhone + iPad downloads up 7.6% to 3.1 billion during the same period.\nOctober alone saw global App Store revenue growth of 15.1%, with a 6.7% rise in China. Average revenue per download grew by 6.4% year-over-year, supporting the \u201cBuy\u201d rating. Mohan anticipates a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, expanding gross margins, and steady cash flows.\nIn App Store categories, entertainment revenue grew by 37% year-over-year, marking it as the second-largest and one of the fastest-growing categories. Gaming revenue reached $1.4 billion, making up 47% of total App Store revenue compared to 53% the previous year, reflecting diversification as non-gaming apps increase monetization. Notably, categories such as Entertainment (16%), Photo & Video (7%), Social Networking (4%), and Productivity (3%) continue to grow, suggesting a broadening of revenue sources beyond gaming.\nMohan also noted the minimal impact of the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) on Apple\u2019s App Store downloads.\nAlthough Google Chrome downloads in the EU rose by 123% year-over-year, totaling 15 million, this is a small portion of Apple\u2019s EU device base. Overall, App Store downloads in the EU grew by 9%, while revenue increased by 28% year-over-year, indicating that consumer behavior remains steady post-DMA compliance.\nFor Apple\u2019s total services revenue in the first fiscal quarter, Mohan anticipates 13% year-over-year growth, maintaining this outlook into the second quarter, highlighting the enduring strength of Apple\u2019s Services segment as a positive long-term sign.\nStory Continues\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.64% at $221.49 at last check Monday.\nPhoto: Andrey Bayda via Shutterstock\nAlso Read:\nApple iPhone 16 Sees 20% Sales Surge in China, But AI Absence Prompts Early Price Cuts\nLatest Ratings for AAPL\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nBarclays\nMaintains\nEqual-Weight\nFeb 2022\nTigress Financial\nMaintains\nStrong Buy\nJan 2022\nCredit Suisse\nMaintains\nNeutral\nView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants. Robust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers.\nIndustry Description\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung. Expanding screen size, better display, and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n3 Micro Computer Industry Trends to Watch\nEnterprise Adoption Remains Healthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\n\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\n\nAI-enabled PCs to Boost Demand: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be they Windows or Apple\u2019s MacOS-based ones, are expected to benefit from AI infusion. Canalys expects AI-enabled PC shipments to reach 48 million in 2024, representing 18% of total PC shipments. AI-capable PC shipments are projected to surpass 100 million in 2025, which will represent 40% of all PC shipments. This offers significant growth opportunities for industry participants.\nStory Continues\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospect\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #210, which places it in the bottom 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nGiven the dim outlook, there are only a few stocks worth watching in the sector. But before we present those stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.\n\nThe industry has gained 16.8% over this period compared with the S&P 500\u2019s return of 20.5% and the broader sector\u2019s growth of 20.5%.\nOne-Year Price Performance\nIndustry's Current Valuation\nOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 26.32X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 21.71X and the sector\u2019s 26.13X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 32.27X and as low as 16.9X, with the median being 24.9X, as the chart below shows.\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\nComputer Stocks to Watch Right Now\nApple: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple currently has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers worldwide, helping it offer appealing new apps that drive the App Store\u2019s traffic. A growing number of AI-infused apps will attract subscribers to the App Store.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has decreased by 1.19% to $7.45 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has gained 15.8% in the year-to-date period.\nPrice and Consensus: AAPL\nDell Technologies: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers, driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications.\n\nIts PowerEdge XE9680L AI-optimized server is very much in demand. Strong enterprise demand for AI-optimized servers is aiding Dell. It is witnessing demand from a diversified customer base that includes higher education institutions, financial services, health care and life services and manufacturing.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been steady at $7.85 per share over the past 30 days. DELL shares have gained 71.1% year to date.\nPrice and Consensus: DELL\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

But Buffett's aggressive selling, combined with Berkshire's record-high $325 billion cash pile, screams one thing: he's not buying into today's sky-high valuations.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAnd it doesn't stop there. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of Berkshire acting as a net seller, meaning they're unloading stocks faster than picking them up. Bank of America, a staple in the portfolio, was also cut loose to the tune of over $10 billion since July. Buffett's been known to keep buying Berkshire stock whenever he sees a deal, but for the first time in six years, buybacks were nowhere in sight. That tells us something big: even Buffett sees his own stock as pricey right now.\nSo what's the takeaway? Buffett's risk-off strategy might hint at what's coming down the pipeline. With cash reserves stacking up and valuations looking inflated, he's positioning Berkshire to be a cash king in a market that might turn bearish. Whether he's bracing for a downturn or keeping his powder dry for a game-changing acquisition, Buffett's moves should give every investor pause. This isn't just portfolio rebalancing; it's Buffett prepping for what could be a rocky market ahead.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Have you evaluated the performance of Apple's (AAPL) international operations for the quarter ending September 2024? Given the extensive global presence of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\nThe global economy today is deeply interlinked, making a company's engagement with international markets a critical factor in determining its financial success and growth path. It has become essential for investors to comprehend how much a company relies on these foreign markets, as this understanding reveals the firm's potential for consistent earnings, its capacity to harness different economic cycles, and its overall growth prospects.\nParticipation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\nOur review of AAPL's last quarterly performance uncovered some notable trends in the revenue contributions from its international markets, which are commonly analyzed and tracked by Wall Street experts.\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter stood at $94.93 billion, increasing 6.1% year over year. Now, let's delve into AAPL's international revenue breakdown to gain insights into the significance of its operations beyond home turf.\nA Dive into AAPL's International Revenue Trends\nRest of Asia Pacific generated $7.38 billion in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 7.78% of the total. This represented a surprise of +5.84% compared to the $6.98 billion projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of Asia Pacific accounted for $6.39 billion (7.45%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $6.33 billion (7.07%) to the total revenue.\nJapan accounted for 6.24% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $5.93 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -1.12%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $5.99 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Japan contributed $5.1 billion (5.94%) and $5.51 billion (6.15%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Europe contributed $24.92 billion in revenue, making up 26.26% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $24.17 billion, this meant a surprise of +3.13%. Looking back, Europe contributed $21.88 billion, or 25.51%, in the previous quarter, and $22.46 billion, or 25.10%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nStory Continues\nOf the total revenue, $15.03 billion came from Greater China during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 15.84%. This represented a surprise of -7.99% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $16.34 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $14.73 billion, or 17.17%, and $15.08 billion, or 16.85%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nProjected Revenues in Foreign Markets\nWall Street analysts expect Apple to report a total revenue of $127.28 billion in the current fiscal quarter, which suggests an increase of 6.4% from the prior-year quarter. Revenue shares from Rest of Asia Pacific, Japan, Europe and Greater China are predicted to be 7.9%, 6.2%, 24.8% and 17.9%, corresponding to amounts of $10.06 billion, $7.86 billion, $31.51 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively.\nAnalysts expect the company to report a total annual revenue of $419.65 billion for the full year, marking an increase of 7.3% compared to last year. The expected revenue contributions from Rest of Asia Pacific, Japan, Europe and Greater China are projected to be 7.7% ($32.28 billion), 6.4% ($26.85 billion), 25.6% ($107.37 billion) and 17.9% ($75.12 billion) of the total revenue, in that order.\nThe Bottom Line\nApple's leaning on foreign markets for its revenue stream presents a mix of chances and challenges. Therefore, a vigilant watch on its international revenue movements can greatly aid in projecting the company's future direction.\nIn an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\nAt Zacks, we place significant importance on a company's evolving earnings outlook. This is based on empirical evidence demonstrating its strong influence on a stock's short -term price movements. Invariably, there exists a positive relationship -- an upward revision in earnings estimates is typically mirrored by a rise in the stock price.\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool, comes with an externally validated impressive track record. It effectively utilizes shifts in earnings projections to act as a dependable barometer for forecasting short-term stock price trends.\nApple, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nReviewing Apple's Recent Stock Price Trends\nOver the preceding four weeks, the stock's value has diminished by 1.7%, against an upturn of 0.4% in the Zacks S&P 500 composite. In parallel, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which counts Apple among its entities, has appreciated by 2.1%. Over the past three months, the company's shares have seen an increase of 3.1% versus the S&P 500's 5.5% increase.

According to a PwC report, it could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity while $9.1 trillion is from consumption-side effects. The report also reveals that global GDP will be up to 14% higher in 2030 due to the accelerating development of AI. The greatest productivity gains are likely to go to North America and China, with the former expected to realize the AI benefits faster.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\nHowever, the surge in artificial intelligence will require a huge number of data centers, and it is significantly going to impact how much the world consumes power, and how much that is going to cost. To have an idea, on average, a ChatGPT search needs as much as 10 times more electricity to process as a Google search. That said, AI gathering steam is only going to make the power hunger crazier. According to estimates from Goldman Sachs, the data center demand is going to grow 160% by 2030. Presently, data centers consume about 1-2% of overall power, but the percentage is likely to rise to 3-4% by the end of the decade.\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAs we examine the increasing energy demand of data centers stemming from the surge in AI, it\u2019s worth noting how these advancements are manifesting in practical applications. In its latest breakthrough, Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company that builds reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems, has launched Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u2014their first release in the forthcoming Claude 3.5 model family. The Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency (HumanEval), demonstrating marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural and relatable tone.\nAnother exciting news is how Runway, an AI company shaping the next era of art, entertainment, and human creativity, has launched a new set of advanced AI camera controls for its Gen-3 Alpha Turbo video generation model. These tools allow the user generating videos from text prompts, upload images, or even their footage, to have greater control over the AI-generated settings and characters. Users can even zoom in or out of the scene and subjects without disrupting their realism, creating a more immersive experience of a seemingly 3D world.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, a highly anticipated release that many have been waiting on is seemingly delayed, as per the latest reports. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that his company\u2019s next big model won\u2019t likely be released this year. According to Altman, the company is \"prioritizing\" shipping existing models focused on reasoning and difficult questions.\n\u201cAll of these models have gotten quite complex and we can\u2019t ship as many things in parallel as we\u2019d like to\u201d. He said the company faces \u201climitations and hard decisions\u201d when it comes to allocating compute resources \u201ctowards many great ideas.\u201d - Altman wrote during a Reddit AMA.\nWhen asked about the release of ChatGPT-5, Altman stated that the company has some very good releases this year but \u201cnothing that we are going to call GPT-5.\u201d\nNow, let's take a look at the 10 latest developments in AI that investors should not miss.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Exceeds Q3 Expectations with Strong International Growth and AWS Margin Gains; Truist Raises Price Target Amid $75B AI CapEx\nA large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a multinational technology company offering e-commerce, cloud computing, and services such as digital streaming and artificial intelligence solutions.\nOn November 1st, Truist reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares and raised the firm\u2019s price target to $270 from $265. The company\u2019s Q3 results surpassed expectations, with particular strength in International growth and profitability, along with a material step up in margins in North American stores & AWS, notes the analyst. The firm also added that the company\u2019s CapEx is pushed to $75 billion this year and even more in 2025 by Amazon\u2019s AI investments and that the management has established credibility to invest in light of the substantial opportunity aggressively.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Shares of US power producers slumped in response, as investors bet that FERC\u2019s ruling would set back efforts by major technology companies to gain quick access to nuclear energy to power their growing data centers.\n\u201cWe remain committed to continue innovating and advancing carbon-free energy solutions with companies like Talen Energy to power data center operations in the United States and the many technologies supporting our customers and our daily lives,\u201d Duncan Neasham, an Amazon spokesperson, said Monday in an email. Reached by phone, Neasham confirmed the company intends to go forward with the Talen project.\nTalen in March had announced that Amazon\u2019s cloud computing unit would pay $650 million for a data center campus of as much as 960 megawatts adjacent to Talen\u2019s Susquehanna nuclear plant.\nUnder the deal, the data center campus would be powered directly by the plant, meaning Amazon wouldn\u2019t have to plug into the wider grid or fund related transmission upgrades. Some utility owners challenged the move, saying it could threaten grid reliability and raise rates. Talen had previously secured the rights to power the facility with as much as 300 megawatts in that manner. That authorization is unaffected by FERC\u2019s ruling.\nAmazon and other big cloud-computing companies, desperate for power to support their growing operations while pursuing their public goals to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, have sought agreements with operators of nuclear power plants.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Inovalon Unveils New Research, Products, and Solutions to Tackle Healthcare\u2019s Most Complex Challenges\nBOWIE, Md., Nov. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inovalon, a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions empowering data-driven healthcare, welcomed industry trailblazers and visionary executives to the stage at Empower 2024, sparking meaningful conversations with leaders from every corner of healthcare. The annual summit, focused on the intersection of healthcare and technology, welcomed attendees in Washington, D.C., to showcase innovative strategies aimed at improving clinical, financial, and operational performance.\nKicking off the summit, Keith Dunleavy, M.D., CEO and Founder of Inovalon, brought attendees through a technological innovation journey to highlight AI, machine learning, and data\u2019s impact on healthcare. Dunleavy shared, \u201cWe have an opportunity to make healthcare better, but we need to fully embrace the rapid progression of software sophistication and technology. We need to be willing to take on innovation at a faster, more uncomfortable pace.\u201d\nApplying AI in Healthcare, Today and Tomorrow\n\nAI innovation took center stage at Empower, with many sessions illustrating its transformative potential across the healthcare ecosystem. Industry leaders Rajesh Viswanathan, CTO at Inovalon, Rahul Pathak, VP of Gen AI and AI/ML GTM at AWS (NASDAQ: AMZN), Vinod Mamtani, VP, AI and Data Science Services at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (NYSE: ORCL), and Murali Gandhirajan, Global Healthcare CTO at Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), shared their perspectives on where the biggest opportunities in technology exist and their vision for how AI will unfold in the future of healthcare. The panel agreed that AI is a powerful force multiplier poised to personalize care interactions, automate workflows, and accelerate drug development. But they were clear: organizations must lean into these advancements or risk being left behind, and as the industry embraces emerging technology to assist, augment, and accelerate outcomes, those who commit will lead the way in delivering more efficient, impactful care.\nModernizing the Healthcare System\nFormer CDC Director, Rochelle Walensky, M.D., MPH, joined Inovalon\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Paige Killian, M.D., on stage at Empower to advocate for data modernization across the healthcare and public health systems. Dr. Walensky provided first-hand perspective on the data challenges that the U.S. public health infrastructure faced during the pandemic and other outbreaks while she worked in the CDC and the difficulties with collecting and integrating a vast amount of data from various sources and formats in a timely manner. She emphasized that to get actionable data before we get past the peak of an outbreak or even the next pandemic, we must educate and upskill the healthcare workforce in data analysis and AI. This emphasis on the role of the healthcare and public health workforce in data modernization was a recurring theme throughout the conference, with all participants and speakers agreeing that a modern data strategy serves as the foundation for any successful public health, AI, or technology strategy.\nStory Continues\nMaximizing Real-World Evidence and Utilizing SDOH Data to Improve Outcomes\n\nAn additional theme at Empower was the benefit of unlocking real-world evidence (RWE) and social drivers of health (SDOH) data to create a more equitable healthcare ecosystem. While clinical trials are essential for determining drug safety and efficacy, they are prone to gaps in understanding the patient\u2019s experience and real-world outcomes. Industry experts, including Christie Teigland, Ph.D., VP of Research Science & Advanced Analytics at Inovalon, Todd Sharp, Head of Strategy & Transformation for Healthcare and Life Sciences at AWS (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Brett Kay, Director of Healthcare Quality Strategy at Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), shared strategies for activating RWE and SDOH data to support vulnerable and underrepresented populations. With SDOH contributing to up to 80% of health outcomes, these sessions highlighted opportunities for leveraging data to bridge care gaps and improve cross-industry collaboration. But first, it was clear there must be a push to reduce disparate data sources, improve health literacy, and actively fight against health disparities to improve representation and care across the healthcare continuum.\nThe Future of Patient-Centric Cell and Gene Therapies\n\nCell and gene therapies have transformed how the healthcare industry treats and potentially cures common and rare diseases. Kim Tedesco, RPh, Director of Gene & Cell Therapy Pharmacy Operations at Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA), welcomed to the Empower stage the first patient to ever receive a CRISPR cell-based gene therapy treatment for sickle cell. The patient advocate brought attendees through her care and treatment journey while living with the crippling disease through childhood and adulthood. The session highlighted the miracles of these therapies and the essential relationships between pharmacies, providers, and health plans needed to ensure patients receive life-saving treatments.\nAdvancing Data-Driven Healthcare: Seven New Software Solutions and Feature-Set Expansions Announced\nIn a continued effort to drive ever-greater impact across the healthcare continuum, Inovalon unveiled seven new products and features to help providers, payers, pharmacies, and life sciences prioritize data-driven healthcare.\nThe Eligibility Verification Pro solution improves revenue cycle management by simplifying providers\u2019 ability to accurately verify patients\u2019 insurance coverage, reducing claims denials, and improving cash flow. For health plans, Inovalon announced Converged Provider Enablement to turn cost and utilization data into actionable insights, Converged Record Review to automate manual medical record reviews and improve risk score accuracy, and Converged Outreach Connectors to provide secure, seamless member data sharing capabilities. Additionally, the company also launched a Research Network to help health systems and life sciences organizations accelerate access to clinical trials and life-saving therapies. Finally, Inovalon is expanding the feature set of ScriptMed and debuted the new Inovalon Application Portal to provide customers with a centralized hub to find and launch all Inovalon ONE\u00ae Platform applications.\nAdditional details on the product news can be found on Inovalon\u2019s website here: https://www.inovalon.com/news/inovalon-launches-seven-new-software-solutions-and-feature-set-expansions-to-drive-ever-greater-impact-across-the-healthcare-continuum/.\n\"Empower 2024 showed us that the technology revolution poised to transform healthcare isn\u2019t lifetimes away \u2013 it\u2019s right around the corner,\u201d said Eron Kelly, President of Inovalon. \u201cInovalon is leading the charge in data-driven healthcare transformation. Together, with our customers and partners, we are shifting from a reactive, episodic industry to a more predictive and preventive system where data, AI, and personalization are shaping the future of healthcare.\u201d\nExperience Empower 2024\u2019s best moments here: https://www.inovalon.com/empower/.\n\n\nAbout Inovalon\nInovalon is a leading provider of cloud-based SaaS solutions empowering data-driven healthcare.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in November.\nAmid soaring valuations of AI stocks, beginner investors keep wondering whether they are too late to the AI party. However, investing experts believe that opportunities abound in the AI space because of the nature of this technological revolution.\nWhile talking to Wall Street Journal during the\u00a0WSJ Tech Live Conference, venture capitalist Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, explained why he believes there is no such thing as \u201ctoo late\u201d when it comes to AI for now.\n\u201cWhen it comes to AI, it really feels like the marginal cost of language, reasoning and creation are going to zero. And if that\u2019s the case, this is a supercycle. And if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ve got decades. So there\u2019s no \u201ctoo late.\u201d In that sense, we\u2019re still very, very early.\u201d\nThe AI revolution is quickly entering the phase where we are seeing real-life use cases as AI is helping companies significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency. According to a detailed report published by Benesch\u2019s AI Commission, an AI-based tool that monitors real-time data from electronic medical records reduced unexpected deaths in hospitalized internal medicine patients by 26%.\nCasado also talked about the usability of AI models for actual problem-solving:\n\u201cEverybody looks at the OpenAIs. But as far as value creation and integration, if you look at all the private companies, the smaller companies that are building their own smaller models, they are some of the fastest-growing companies we\u2019ve seen in the history of the industry.\u201d\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\u00a0and\u00a010 Best Mid-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and earnings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nEasiest Items to Sell on Amazon for Profit\nTtatty / Shutterstock.com\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) threw it out of the park with its latest quarterly results amid strong Cloud growth. Amazon Web Services is generated $27.5 billion in revenue, marking a 19% year-over-year increase. The segment\u2019s operating income is expanding at nearly 2.5 times the rate of its revenue growth, boosting Amazon\u2019s overall operating income. At this pace, AWS is on track to deliver $110 billion in annualized revenue. If it maintains its ~20% growth rate, AWS could reach $125-130 billion in revenue in FY 2025.\nStory Continues\nFor the ongoing quarter, Amazon expects revenue between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, implying growth up to 11%. Amazon\u2019s stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 32.9, higher than the big tech average of 25.5. If Amazon grows its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 25% annually over the next three years, it could achieve an EPS of around $9.25 by FY 2027 (up from an estimated $4.74 in FY 2024). Applying a 35x P/E ratio in line with Amazon\u2019s historical average suggests a fair stock value of over $300. The primary catalyst for this target would be AWS\u2019s robust operating income growth.\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) continued growth is driven by its strong performance in AWS and advertising, which grew 19% and 20%, respectively. E-commerce growth moderated to 9.3%, likely due to softer consumer demand.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in November. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Netflix's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Netflix\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Netflix is:\n34% = US$7.8b \u00f7 US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.34 in profit.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nA Side By Side comparison of Netflix's Earnings Growth And 34% ROE\nFirst thing first, we like that Netflix has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Netflix's exceptional 22% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.\nWe then performed a comparison between Netflix's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 27% in the same 5-year period.\npast-earnings-growth\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for NFLX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\nStory Continues\nIs Netflix Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nGiven that Netflix doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nSummary\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Netflix's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) stock is up 79% over the past 12 months and trading at a premium valuation. Does the streaming giant have another leg higher, or is the rally running out of steam? With the stock up significantly and shares trading at 38 times analysts\u2019 December 2024 earnings estimates, it might seem that shares are running out of juice. However, the company has a secret weapon that it is ready to launch this month and expand as we head into 2025 \u2013 a new in-house ad server.\nI\u2019m bullish on Netflix because of its new in-house ad server, which should allow the company to capitalize on its growing ad-supported tier and make it a more valuable partner for advertisers, unlocking the next phase of the company\u2019s growth.\nAd-Supported Memberships Are Growing\nThings are going well for Netflix. The $324.6 billion company reported strong third-quarter results, growing revenue 15% year-over-year. Meanwhile, it increased operating income by a scorching 52% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, and its operating margin was 30%, up from 22% last year. In addition, ad-supported memberships are becoming a bigger part of the company\u2019s business, as they grew a remarkable 35% quarter-over-quarter.\nAnd Netflix\u2019s new secret weapon is poised to make this ad-supported tier even more lucrative for the company in the months ahead. Netflix\u2019s new ad server will launch in Canada this month and then in additional markets in 2025. Netflix previously relied on Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) ad server, but its new ad server will take advantage of partnerships with Google Live and Trade Desk (TTD).\nWhat Is an Ad Server?\nWhat is an ad server, and why is this important for Netflix? According to Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS), ad servers are \u201cthe technology engines that allow advertisers and publishers to optimize, manage, and distribute ads across a multitude of paid channels,\u201d such as Netflix and YouTube. Netflix\u2019s ad server will allow it to sell advertising slots to potential advertisers who want to advertise to viewers watching Netflix content.\nDigital ads like these are quite valuable to advertisers because they are more targeted and tailored to the specific viewer than traditional broadcast ads. Netflix is very close to the end user and their data, so based on the user\u2019s viewing habits and other data, Netflix\u2019s server may know that they like golf and can serve them ads for new golf clubs or golf apparel, which are more relevant to them than a broader ad for something they are not interested in.\nAs you can imagine, these narrowly-targeted, data-driven ads are also more valuable to the advertisers themselves.\nStory Continues\n\u201cEpisodic\u201d Ads that Tell a Story\nNetflix has also talked about the idea of serving customers \u201cepisodic\u201d ads that tell a story within themselves, which could help to attract attention and maintain interest from viewers. Co-CEO and President Ted Sarandos says that the ad server is a \u201ckey server in unlocking value\u201d in the ad-supported market and that \u201cwhile we\u2019ve got lots of work to do, we are very confident in our ability to execute and grow our ad business much like we did with the paid sharing initiative.\u201d\nUltimately, the proprietary ad server will empower Netflix to deliver more targeted, more valuable ads to its growing number of ad-tier subscribers around the world, powering the next leg up in the company\u2019s growth.\nNetflix\u2019s Valuation\nAs discussed above, Netflix trades at a premium valuation of 38.1 times earnings, but with analysts projecting earnings per share to grow to $23.79 for Fiscal 2025, the company trades at a slightly more inviting valuation of 31.8 times forward earnings, getting a bit closer to the S&P 500\u2019s (SPX) average valuation of 25 times earnings.\nAs the company continues to grow its ad-supported tier and better monetize this segment thanks to its in-house ad server, earnings should continue to grow over time and make this valuation more palatable.\nIs NFLX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nTurning to Wall Street, NFLX earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, 10 Holds, and two Sells assigned in the past three months. The average NFLX stock price target of $786.34 implies 4% upside potential from current levels.\nSee more NFLX analyst ratings\nSmart Score\nWhile Wall Street analysts view Netflix as a Moderate Buy, TipRanks\u2019 proprietary Smart Score system is decidedly bullish. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Netflix boasts an impressive Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 9 out of 10.\nLooking Ahead\nNetflix has been a great growth story for a long time and has gained nearly 80% over the past 12 months. However, the company could still have ample room for growth ahead as it debuts its new ad server in Canada this month and then rolls it out to a larger number of markets in 2025. I\u2019m bullish on Netflix based on the development and rollout of this valuable tool that Sarandos called the \u201ckey to unlocking value\u201d in the ad market.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "It's no secret the overall media and entertainment industry has struggled in recent years, burdened by labor strikes, profitability challenges, and a transition to streaming that's upended some of the most well-known corporate behemoths.\nOne company, though, has thrived amid the various changes: Netflix (NFLX).\nThe streaming platform beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs. The stock is up more than 50% since the start of the year.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCompared to other players, Netflix's subscriber count and profitability stand out.\nThe streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%.\nAnd in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close.\nDisney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks.\n\"Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,\" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance.\nOther analysts have piled onto that thinking, declaring the infamous streaming wars officially over.\n\"Netflix won the streaming wars,\" MoffettNathanson, one of the leading equity research firms for the tech and media sector, said in a note penned by analyst Robert Fishman last week. \"The media space right now is defined by a dichotomy in which Netflix stands as a lone exception.\"\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan agreed, recently telling Yahoo Finance's Market Domination that the company has \"undoubtedly\" secured its No. 1 position.\nHow we got here\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and, most importantly, subscribers.\nThe goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\nStory Continues\nAt the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. \"Bridgerton\" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.\nOthers soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for \"The Office\" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time.\nNetflix CEO Ted Sarandos (C) poses with cast and crew as they arrive for Netflix's \"Bridgerton Season 3\" premiere at Alice Tully Hall on May 13, 2024, in New York City. (ANDREA RENAULT / AFP) \u00b7 ANDREA RENAULT via Getty Images\nBut investors quickly realized that streaming is a tough business. It's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. Case in point: the profit struggles at Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount, among others.\nNetflix, viewed by even its competitors as \"the gold standard\" in streaming, has consistently had the upper hand due to its first-mover advantage as a pure-play streaming company. Its innovative approach to monetization, which includes controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, has also helped boost its positioning.\nAs the market stands today, Netflix's total enterprise value is now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined. It's viewed as a growth stock on Wall Street with full-year revenue expected to climb over 15% year over year.\nAnd as the chart below shows, Netflix's estimated enterprise multiple, which is a ratio used to determine the value of a company after taking into account debt and cash levels, in addition to stock price and cash profitability, comes second only to tech giant Apple. Not too shabby for a pure-play streaming player.\nCatching up to Netflix\nFishman argued in his note that a handful of key assets will be needed for streaming players to not only catch up to Netflix but to survive the industry's massive transition.\nThis includes a scaled streaming service (both in the US and globally), a free advertising video-on-demand (AVOD) platform, top-tier sports rights, a US broadcast network, and film and television studios.\nNot every company will need each one of these assets. But having any can boost a company's respective position within the industry.\nTake Disney (DIS), for example. The media conglomerate checks off every box except a free AVOD platform. But having a scaled streaming service in the US and abroad, like Netflix has, appears to be the formula to success \u2014 at least in the current moment.\n\"That really is, it seems, the end goal,\" Fishman said. \"Whether a company wants that for its own sake (all the traditional players) or to augment sales of toilet paper or cellphones [like Amazon], that is the goal.\"\nThat means joint ventures and other deals like acquisitions will be likely outcomes heading into the back half of the decade.\nParamount (PARA) has already agreed to merge with Skydance Media in a deal that's set to mark an end to the Redstone family's control of the company. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025.\nRegulatory challenges could be an overhang, however. A judge temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), citing antitrust concerns.\nThe Big Tech giants would face similar dealmaking hurdles given their size, while media companies combining with each other would pose their own risk, as nearly all of the top players carry heavy debt loads.\nIn his report, Fishman said Fox and WBD have the most complementary assets for a possible combination, especially since WBD lacks the NFL and most recently lost the NBA. The company is currently tied up in litigation after suing the NBA over the loss of those media rights.\nNetflix has won the streaming wars, but where does that leave everyone else? (Getty Images) \u00b7 SimpleImages via Getty Images\nTo that point, sports has emerged as the final frontier of streaming amid a dying cable TV business. But professional leagues have also been hesitant to fully abandon traditional television.\nThat gives the upper hand to companies with a broadcast network like Fox, Comcast and Disney, in Fishman's view.\n\"While leagues are also increasingly comfortable partnering with streamers, as the NFL Thursday Night Football transition from Fox to Amazon showed, doing so still presents a tradeoff in viewership,\" Fishman pointed out. \"Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners.\"\nAnd as new data shows, companies with exposure to both traditional television and streaming typically capture the most eyeballs.\nDisney's traditional broadcast and streaming properties accounted for a combined 11.3% of overall TV viewing time during the month of September, according to the latest Gauge report from Nielsen.\nGoogle's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Netflix rounded out the top five at 10.6%, 9.3%, 8.2%, and 7.9%, respectively.\nLooking ahead, \"Disney has the right asset mix to establish a true second global streaming service after Netflix,\" Fishman predicted. Disney, which is in the midst of finding its next CEO with Bob Iger's contract set to expire at the end of 2026, will report quarterly earnings on Nov. 14.\nBut he warned the rest of traditional media companies like Comcast, Paramount, and Warner Bros. \"still need to quickly determine which path to take in order to better position themselves within the great streaming game\" \u2014 whether that means a merger, asset sale, acquisition, partnership, or something else altogether.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this internet video service have returned +7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has gained 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nNetflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +99.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.2%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has changed +3.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Roku (ROKU) stock fell more than 17% on Thursday after the company's fourth quarter guidance disappointed, despite the media player reporting its first quarter of $1 billion in revenue.\nFor the current quarter, the company estimated gross profit to hit $465 million, with adjusted EBITDA expected at $30 million. Both metrics fell below Wall Street expectations of $477 million in gross profit and $36.2 million in adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022 USD\n(ROKU)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe company also said it will stop reporting streaming households as a key performance metric, echoing a similar move from streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), which will no longer report subscriber figures at the start of next year.\nInstead, Roku said it will focus on streaming hours, platform revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n\"Since our IPO in 2017, the streaming industry has evolved meaningfully, with Americans now spending significantly more TV time streaming than watching cable,\" Roku said in its earnings release. \"Our business has also grown and evolved, and we are now primarily focused on growing platform revenue and profitability.\"\nPrior to Wednesday's release, shares had rallied more than 30% over the past three months on expectations of a strong ad market and upside to platform revenue growth.\nIt's a critical shift for the company, which underwent a number of cost-cutting measures last year in an effort to bring down operating expenses and improve profits. Roku has recently committed to various monetization initiatives, which have included a deeper integration with programmatic advertising giant the Trade Desk (TTD).\nRoku said those efforts, along with tailwinds from political ad spend, will \"continue in Q4.\"\nA Roku logo is seen on a screen with a silhouette of a hand holding a tv remote. (Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) \u00b7 SOPA Images via Getty Images\nIn the third quarter, Roku reported net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 16% year over year, with a net loss of $65 million, or $0.06 a share. That quarterly net loss was significantly narrower than the $0.33 loss Wall Street expected, as well as the prior-year period's $2.33 quarterly loss.\nPlatform revenue, which includes ad sales, revenue from distribution deals, and the over-the-top streaming service, the Roku Channel, came in at $908 million, up 15% on the year.\nThe boom was driven by strength in advertising sales, content distribution, and expansion into international markets.\n\"In Q3, the year-over-year growth of advertising activities across the Roku platform \u2014 excluding media and entertainment \u2014 outperformed both the overall ad market and the over-the-top (OTT) ad market in the US,\" Roku said, highlighting strength in political, retail, and consumer packaged goods ad verticals.\nStory Continues\nThe company reported 85.5 million streaming households, a sequential increase of 2 million and up 13% year over year. Streaming hours also increased 5.3 billion year over year to reach 32 billion in the quarter.\nOverall, the company has been facing more competition in the connected TV and streaming ads business.\nAmazon (AMZN) rolled out ads on its Prime Video streaming service earlier this year in the US. Wall Street has noted the massive disruption the tech giant has already caused in the space as companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) are also in the running for ad buyers.\nOn Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne reiterated his Underweight rating on shares, categorizing recent optimism as \"premature\" and rising competition \"as an under-appreciated risk.\"\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

AOUT, Crocs, Inc. CROX, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Mattel, Inc. MAT.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n5 Discretionary Stocks to Buy as Consumer Confidence Hits 9-Month High\nU.S. consumers are much more confident now than they were last month. A jumbo rate cut announced last month by the Federal Reserve, coupled with optimism surrounding more interest rate cuts in the coming months, have made consumers confident about the economy's health.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in discretionary stocks such as American Outdoor Brands, Inc., Crocs, Inc., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Netflix, Inc. and Mattel, Inc.. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nConsumer Confidence Soars\nThe Conference Board said on Tuesday that the consumer confidence index surged to 108.7 in October, from 99.2 in the previous month, to hit its highest level in nine months.\nThe Present Situation Index, a measure of consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, jumped 14.2 points to reach 138. The Expectations Index, a measure of consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market situation, rose 6.3 points to 89.1. This was comfortably above the threshold of 80. Any reading below 80 indicates impending recession.\nThe jump in consumer confidence comes after ebbing drastically in September on fears of a slowing economy. Interestingly, consumer confidence remained high in October despite data suggesting a cooling job market.\nThe Labor Department said on Tuesday that job openings fell to a three-and-a-half-year low in September. Despite the decline, the Conference Board's survey showed that consumers' perceptions of the jobs market improved in October, which boosted their confidence.\nMore Rate Cut Hopes Boost Consumer Confidence\nFears gripped markets earlier this month after fresh data showed a slight uptick in monthly inflation in September. This raised concerns over the economy's health, turning markets volatile.\nHowever, consumers are hoping that inflation will still be on track to reach the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first rate cut since March 2020.\nStory Continues\nThe Federal Reserve has also hinted that more rate cuts are on the horizon if inflation continues to ease substantially. The CME FedWatch tool presently shows a 98.9% possibility of a 25-basis point cut in November and a 76.6% probability of a 20-basis point cut in December.

If that holds in trading Thursday, it will be the biggest one-day loss since a 24% decline on Feb. 16, when the company issued a lower-than-expected forecast.\nThe decision to withhold the data follows a similar one by Netflix Inc. in April, when the company announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers.\n\u201cBeginning with our Q1 2025 earnings results, we will no longer report quarterly updates on streaming households,\u201d the company said in a statement. That means it will also no longer report average revenue per user.\nThe company said its key performance metrics will be streaming hours, platform revenue, adjusted earnings and free cash flow.\n\u201cWe will continue to grow streaming households and will continue to track and announce key milestones such as 100 million HHs, which we said we expect to reach in the next 12-18 months,\u201d the company said in an email.\nThe company also issued a fourth-quarter profit forecast that fell short of Wall Street estimates. Adjusted earnings this quarter will be $30 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That\u2019s below the $36.2 million average of analysts\u2019 estimates.\nIn April, shares of Netflix fell after the company announced it would stop reporting both subscribers and average revenue per user starting in the first quarter of 2025.\n(Updates with company comment in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Hipsters Are Coming for Your Favorite Apps\nHow Elon Musk Came to Embrace the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019\nMusk Takes a Victory Lap at Incendiary Trump Rally\nMeg Whitman\u2019s Mission in Africa: American Tech Over Chinese\nDog Man Movie Is Here to Swoop In and Rescue the Children\u2019s Book Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Back in 2002, Martha Stewart made headlines for aggressively chopping a cabbage in an effort to avoid speaking of insider-trading allegations. \u201cI want to focus on my salad,\u201d she said through tight lips. Fast-forward more than a decade later and Stewart is still trying to change the focus to more flattering aspects of her life. Or in other words, focus on her salad.\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Stewart apparently spent around 30 minutes complaining about Martha, the Netflix documentary made about her. Calling the second part of the movie \u201ca bit lazy,\u201d Stewart took issue with the way director R.J. Cutler portrayed her.\n\u201cThose last scenes with me looking like a lonely old lady walking hunched over in the garden? Boy, I told him to get rid of those. And he refused. I hate those last scenes. Hate them,\u201d she told the Times, adding that she was limping because she had just had an operation on her Achilles tendon, a detail that the director omitted to her chagrin.\nIndeed, Stewart might have the titular role in said Martha, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s finding herself in all that flattering of a biopic. She said that despite her having three cameras on her, the director would choose \u201cto use the ugliest angle\u201d and ignore her protests to use other ones.\nThe soundtrack was not spared criticism, as Stewart called out the usage of \u201csome lousy classical score,\u201d instead of using mostly rap, which she had deemed an \u201cessential part of the film.\u201d She had suggested that her friend Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre score the film.\nExpressing dismay that some of her more exciting stories were cut, her grandchildren weren\u2019t mentioned, and the allure of her magazines wasn\u2019t touched upon, Stewart expressed her annoyance that her prison sentence got so much attention.\nStewart spent five months, from October 2004 to March 2005, in a minimum-security prison for charges related to insider trading. \u201cI had to go through that to be a trophy for these idiots in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office,\u201d she said in the Netflix documentary, claiming that she was a target because of her title as the first self-made billionaire woman in America.\nShe said of prison that it was \u201cnot a good experience and it doesn't make you stronger\u201d to Katie Couric in 2017. Stewart has since made her comeback, and it appears she doesn\u2019t want to linger on that dip too much.\n\u201cIt was not that important,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cThe trial and the actual incarceration was less than two years out of an 83-year life. I considered it a vacation, to tell you the truth,\u201d she said, adding that the trial was so dull that the judge fell asleep.\nStory Continues\nIndeed, it seems as if over time, Stewart has changed her take on her sentence a bit. In Martha, she calls her daytime show a venture that \u201cmissed the point of Martha Stewart. A live audience, crummy music, that was more like prison than being at Alderson.\"\nThat being said, Stewart praised the first part of the documentary to the Times. She noted that young women have told her that watching the film \u201cgave them a strength they didn\u2019t know they had.\u201d And that was the point of the project.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted the documentary to be. It shouldn\u2019t be me boasting about inner strength and any of that crap. It should be about showing that you can get through life and still be yourself,\u201d she concluded.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best streaming and TV stocks to invest in.\nConsumer Behaviour Around Streaming Choices\nAlmost all streaming services hiked up their rates and drove subscription prices high in 2023. However, cost is not the biggest factor for consumers while they stream. As of today, the price of streaming services doesn\u2019t affect loyalty to an entertainment provider as it did in the past. Amdocs\u2019 \u201cThe New Streamer 2024\u201d report revealed that consumers are expecting improved experiences with rising costs. According to consumers, original content is the top feature that makes a subscription worthy. Other leading factors include access to older titles, new content every few weeks, and being able to watch anywhere.\nTrends Shaping the Streaming Industry\nForbes reported that streamers have been victims of long-term challenges related to profitability and subscriber growth. To counter these issues while catering to evolving consumer demands, streamers are opting for ad-supported plans. With almost half of the younger generation open to seeing more ads, this is a potential way to boost revenue.\nStreamers are also trying to score exclusive agreements and partnerships with sports leagues as live sports has become a hot commodity in streaming. Simultaneously, the cost of original content comes at reduced profitability. Against this, the potential solution is a consolidation of streaming platforms to allow access to deeper libraries of content for consumers without compromising on their priority of having original content on their plate. Additionally, cloud gaming is being integrated into streaming services considering 70% of Gen Z appears to be interested in it.\nOn October 18, Ben Silverman, Propagate Content Chairman & Co-CEO, appeared on CNBC giving examples of the aforementioned streaming industry trends. Commenting on the robust Q3 earnings for streaming giant Netflix, he said that its success would lead to more consolidation among the traditional media players in the smaller streamer space. The company is increasingly investing in original content, sports content, and gaming, something that will continue to reward the company as it expands its profits as well as businesses. While it has the money from its streaming business to make those investments back into streaming, many players in the streaming space do not have the same capabilities. Comcast also has the ability to sell a lot of WiFi and has many other businesses that can drive investment in the content business. He mentioned the telecommunications and media firm\u2019s acquisition of NBCUniversal becoming an engine for the whole company. In the views of Silverman, more troubled are the companies that are pure-play so they need to either consolidate to get to scale or be acquired by the bigger players in the future.\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, Silverman emphasized how sports acquisitions are the key drivers to advertising and not just the drivers in the ability to scale an audience at once. For instance, The streaming giant will be live-streaming two of the 2024 season\u2019s NFL games on Christmas Day. Previously in July, NBCUniversal and the NBA announced an 11-year agreement for NBC, Peacock, USA Network, Sky Sports, and Telemundo to present NBA and WNBA regular-season and playoff games starting in the 2025-26 season.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in, we sifted through ETFs, the Yahoo Finance stock screener, the Finviz stock screener, and online rankings to create an initial list of stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 7 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 7 best streaming and TV stocks to invest in have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNetflix, Inc. (NFLX)'s Financial Growth and Future Advertising Ventures\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNumber of Hedge Fun Holders:\u00a0103\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a global streaming entertainment service with 283 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries enjoying TV series, films, and games across various genres and languages. Netflix started its journey in 1997 as a DVD-rental-by-mail firm and began streaming in the US in 2007 and internationally in 2010 while it became global in 2016.\nWith streaming entertainment replacing the linear TV experience potentially for an enduring period, Netflix expects to be one of the leading firms of the streaming entertainment era. The firm has been at a scale where it can economically create original content for Netflix since 2013 thereby reaping the benefits of originals. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a major advantage over its linear competitors as its shows don\u2019t compete for scarce prime-time slots like on linear TV. Furthermore, the reach is vast with Netflix being virtually everywhere except for Russia and China.\nIn the third quarter, revenue grew 15% year-over-year. The firm delivered multiple hits in the quarter including The Perfect Couple, Nobody Wants This, Emily in Paris, and CobraKai. Engagement remains strong with view hours per member amongst owner households increasing year-over-year through the first three quarters of 2024. Netflix is simultaneously improving its advertising business, with ads membership up 35% quarter-on-quarter and ad-tech platform set to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025.\nNetflix is well-positioned to bring engaging stories from many cultures to people globally with its global distribution. The firm is all set to benefit from the universal appeal for high-quality storytelling that transcends borders amidst the growing ubiquity of the internet. The firm remains excited about its Q4 slate including Squid Game S2, the Jake Paul/Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. With a steady drumbeat of hit titles from countries globally, healthy member engagement, and a large strong core business, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is poised for growth.\nOverall, NFLX ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of best streaming and TV stocks to invest in.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

According to a PwC report, it could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity while $9.1 trillion is from consumption-side effects. The report also reveals that global GDP will be up to 14% higher in 2030 due to the accelerating development of AI. The greatest productivity gains are likely to go to North America and China, with the former expected to realize the AI benefits faster.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\nHowever, the surge in artificial intelligence will require a huge number of data centers, and it is significantly going to impact how much the world consumes power, and how much that is going to cost. To have an idea, on average, a ChatGPT search needs as much as 10 times more electricity to process as a Google search. That said, AI gathering steam is only going to make the power hunger crazier. According to estimates from Goldman Sachs, the data center demand is going to grow 160% by 2030. Presently, data centers consume about 1-2% of overall power, but the percentage is likely to rise to 3-4% by the end of the decade.\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAs we examine the increasing energy demand of data centers stemming from the surge in AI, it\u2019s worth noting how these advancements are manifesting in practical applications. In its latest breakthrough, Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company that builds reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems, has launched Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u2014their first release in the forthcoming Claude 3.5 model family. The Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency (HumanEval), demonstrating marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural and relatable tone.\nAnother exciting news is how Runway, an AI company shaping the next era of art, entertainment, and human creativity, has launched a new set of advanced AI camera controls for its Gen-3 Alpha Turbo video generation model. These tools allow the user generating videos from text prompts, upload images, or even their footage, to have greater control over the AI-generated settings and characters. Users can even zoom in or out of the scene and subjects without disrupting their realism, creating a more immersive experience of a seemingly 3D world.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, a highly anticipated release that many have been waiting on is seemingly delayed, as per the latest reports. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that his company\u2019s next big model won\u2019t likely be released this year. According to Altman, the company is \"prioritizing\" shipping existing models focused on reasoning and difficult questions.\n\u201cAll of these models have gotten quite complex and we can\u2019t ship as many things in parallel as we\u2019d like to\u201d. He said the company faces \u201climitations and hard decisions\u201d when it comes to allocating compute resources \u201ctowards many great ideas.\u201d - Altman wrote during a Reddit AMA.\nWhen asked about the release of ChatGPT-5, Altman stated that the company has some very good releases this year but \u201cnothing that we are going to call GPT-5.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Bid for AI Startup Run:ai Triggers EU Antitrust Review; Company Assures Openness to Regulator\u2019s Questions\nA close-up view of a banker wearing a suit focused on reviewing a customer's financial documents.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is considered a leader in AI infrastructure and is a star AI stock. The company has built a comprehensive AI ecosystem spanning graphics, computing, and networking solutions.\nOn Thursday, October 31, the European Commission stated that the US Chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will have to seek EU antitrust clearance for its proposed acquisition of the AI startup Run:ai. The move comes amidst concerns that the acquisition threatens competition in the markets where they operate, and may require Nvidia to offer concessions to secure its approval for the deal. Even though the deal doesn\u2019t meet the EU turnover threshold for mandatory approval, the EU watchdog took up the case after Italy\u2019s competition agency requested it.\n\"The transaction threatens to significantly affect competition in the markets where NVIDIA and Run:ai are active, which are likely to be at least European Economic Area-wide and therefore include the referring country Italy\u201d. -EU Commission\nIn response, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) said it was happy to answer any questions that the regulator may have about the acquisition.\n\"After the acquisition closes, we\u2019ll continue to make AI available in every cloud and enterprise, and help customers select any system and software solution that works best for them\u201d -Nvidia spokesperson.\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss.

Courtyards\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nMuddling the Message Around \u2018Climate Havens\u2019\nAfter a blistering artificial intelligence-driven rally of more than 140% this year, the bar is high. Wall Street has become increasingly cautious about Palantir, with the average target implying a decline of more than 30% in the next 12 months. At the same time, investors are still wary about AI-linked names, and want to see more tangible results from the nascent technology. Earnings from Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. were met with mixed reactions.\n\u201cWe cannot rationalize why Palantir is the most expensive name in software,\u201d RBC analysts led by Rishi Jaluria wrote in a note last week. The stock trades at more than 100 times future earnings, while Oracle Corp. and Microsoft both trade at less than 30 times. Palantir shares were about 0.6% lower in afternoon trading in New York.\n\u201cAbsent a substantial beat-and-raise quarter elevating the near-term growth trajectory, valuation seems unsustainable,\u201d Jaluria said. RBC has an underperform rating and $9 price target for Palantir \u2014 about 80% lower than the current price.\nBullish investors see it differently, helping to push the stock to a record high last month. The company, which makes just over half of its revenue from government contracts, got a boost from its recent inclusion in the S&P 500, and is now the third-best performer in that benchmark in 2024 \u2014 trailing only Vistra Corp. and Nvidia Corp.\nPalantir is \u201cone of the few companies that is Gen AI enabled and has actually seen upticks both in the enterprise and government sector,\u201d said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W Baird & Co. \u201cThe Street is just missing, quite frankly, how powerful their core AI-based platform is.\u201d\nPalantir is expected to report third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 9 cents, up 29% from a year ago, but a slower pace of growth than in previous quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue is estimated at about $704 million, up 26% year-over-year.\nInvestors will be particularly focused on customer additions and sales of AI tools to corporate customers. Wall Street estimates revenue from government clients will grow 23%, to nearly $379 million, while commercial sales are expected to increase by about 32%, to $330 million. Palantir has won multiple new corporate clients this year, including CBS Broadcasting, General Mills Inc. and Aramark Services Inc.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotta continue to see that momentum,\u201d in commercial contracts, said Mortonson.\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager at Equity Armor Investments LLC, is also focused on this metric. \u201cThey have really big name contracts, but they are really just scratching the surface in terms of the types of customers they can reach,\u201d he said.\nRBC\u2019s Jaluria, on the other hand, is skeptical that Palantir can keep up the pace of commercial sector wins, given high levels of competition and considering the suitability of Palantir\u2019s products outside of large, non-technical businesses.\nThe RBC analysts also note Palantir\u2019s rally has been helped by a high proportion of retail investors \u2014 a crowd that could sour on the stock quickly, especially if the company doesn\u2019t start returning meaningful capital to investors. Palantir doesn\u2019t offer a dividend and, as of June 30, had $973.3 million of a total authorized $1 billion stock repurchase program available.\n\u201cWith Palantir\u2019s $4 billion cash balance, we think retail investors may be starting to become frustrated (rightfully so) by the company\u2019s lack of willingness to return capital to shareholders given no apparent interest in pursuing M&A opportunities,\u201d Jaluria wrote.\nTech Chart of the Day\nNvidia Corp. is threatening to reclaim the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company from iPhone maker Apple Inc. The chipmaker\u2019s shares are higher on Monday after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday that Nvidia will replace rival Intel Corp. in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meanwhile, Apple shares are lower after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway continued to sell the company\u2019s stock in the third quarter. The spread between the two tech behemoths was about $50 billion as of Friday\u2019s close.\nTop Tech Stories\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc.\u2019s continued sales of Apple shares in the third quarter left the conglomerate\u2019s stake at a fraction of its size at the start of the year.\nNvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the artificial intelligence boom, is joining the oldest of Wall Street\u2019s three main equity benchmarks.\nApple agreed to buy software maker Pixelmator, adding a popular high-end photo-editing app to its lineup.\nElon Musk was dealt a significant setback in a court fight over compensation sought by the top Twitter Inc. executives he fired when he took over the company in 2022.\nThe online dating service Bumble misled shareholders through overly optimistic revenue and other financial metrics projections, a new complaint filed by an investor alleges.\nEarnings Due Monday\nPremarket\nEntegris\nDigitalOcean\nEnfusion\nFox Corp\nNew York Times Co.\nEW Scripps\nPostmarket\nPalantir\nNXP Semi\nAspenTech\nFabrinet\nLattice Semi\nCirrus Logic\nSanmina\nSilicon Labs\nTeradata\nAlpha & Omega Semi\nIchor\n8x8\nAltice USA\nQuinStreet\nVimeo\nWideOpenWest\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Rheaa Rao.\n(Updates stock moves.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Luxury Handbags\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Super Micro then postponed its annual 10-K submission, saying it expects little change in its fiscal 2024 figures.\nDespite Super Micro's continuous financial difficulties, Nvidia is trying to maintain a consistent supply chain for the AI server market by rerouting orders to other suppliers. Early trading Monday saw Nvidia shares rise 1.69%; however, Super Micro's stock remained erratic in light of recent events.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Bill.\nStory Continues\nBill Cobb\nThanks Matt Davis and good morning everyone. I want to start by highlighting our dramatic improvement over the last two plus years when I came into the business in 2022 our gross margins were at an all time low of 43% that has changed today. We are increasing our 2024 gross margin outlook to about 53% an all time high.\nNot many companies can show an over 1,000 basis point margin improvement in such a short time frame.\nTurning to slide. Five, we delivered record financial performance in the third quarter, revenue increased 3% to $540 million gross profit margin expanded 550 basis points to 57%.\nNet income grew 40% to $100 million adjusted EBITA grew 29% to $165 million. And we have used $119 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares year-to-date through August and probably the best news of all as we will show you shortly, our marketing and discounting efforts are working. The DTC customer account actually grew in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And we're now forecasting that our ending 2024 DTC customer count will be in line with a year ago. This is the progress we have been working towards while we are very pleased with the recent trajectory of the DTC business growing. Our home warranty customer base continues to be our number one strategic priority. Our other key strategic priorities are to expand our on demand business and to close the acquisition of 210 homebuyers' warranty.\nSpeaking of the acquisition, our integration team continues to work with 210 to prepare for a smooth transition. The regulatory approval process is nearing completion and we're now just waiting for approval from California bottom line. The acquisition remains on track to close in the fourth quarter okay. So here's how I'm going to lay out the next few minutes first, I'm going to discuss what's happening with home warranties in both the real estate and DTC channels followed by our momentum and on demand, then renewals and finally a major milestone in our customer experience journey. The new A HS app starting with real estate, the market continues to flounder. According to the September report from the National Association of Realtors or NAR, the annual run rate of home sales decreased to 3.8 million homes. The lowest in 14 years. Additionally, mortgage rates and home prices remain elevated.\nSimply put with fewer homes being sold. There are fewer opportunities to attach a home warranty for some context. Our 1st year real estate customer count is down almost 14% in the third quarter versus the prior year and down more than half from five years ago.\nBut there is some positive momentum, some positive movement. Existing home inventory is rising now at 4.3 months of supply which is the highest it's been in the last four years. Further mortgage rates are down from a year ago.\nFinally, American Home Shield has continued to maintain its category leading share of warranties attached to home purchases, turning to slide 11 and the direct to consumer channel. Let's start with the performance of the marketing campaign. In short, it is working for starters. We have significantly grown aided brand awareness. It's jumped from 39% in 2022 to over 54% today due to the brand relaunch and marketing campaign.\nA awareness is also up. Recent research shows that about 40% of homeowners now recognize at least one of the three warranty of TV spots in a crowded media space. That's a very good number.\nGoogle searches for A HS are also up year over year, but I need to make a key point here. There has been some confusion that searches are down according to Google trends. Let me provide some clarity. Google trends is a snapshot of how popular your search term is relative to all search terms. It is not representative of a specific brand's performance over time.\nEven Google says you should not use Google trends for insights or predictive analytics.\nSo the fact is Google searches for AHS are actually up through September. How do we know that we get our information directly from Google? And we certainly do pay for that.\nThis information represents true volume over time and is much more brand specific, accurate and comprehensive.\nSo to be clear, the 1st year of the campaign has been successful as we move forward into the second phase of the A HS marketing campaign, we will continue to build brand awareness in 2025 through a more focused and targeted approach that builds consideration and grows leads. We will share these plans in much more detail at our investor day in new York on February 27th, we are also optimizing our price discounting strategy. This is what smart brands do in times of market, softness brands must adjust to changing consumer behavior.\nTo be clear. We are not relying solely on aggressive discounting. We understand it's not a long term strategy, but it's where we are seeing strong demand and conversion.\nIn summary, within the DTC channel awareness is up, brand, searches are up demand and conversion are up and our customer count is up again. This is what we have been working toward.\nNow. Let me step away from our traditional home warranty business and talk about our ondemand business. We expect to generate over $100 million in ondemand revenue this year, primarily due to our new HVAC program which continues to deliver great results regarding our new partnership with Sorry Moen as announced in our press release last week, we are currently expanding that business to seven additional states. In addition to California front door will still soon be the exclusive installer of mowen smart shutoff valves in Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Oregon, Texas, Georgia and South Carolina.\nWe are also making excellent progress on marketing BT C home warranties to different demographics and channels of distribution. A AR P is a great example of an alternative way to go to market by targeting different segments of their membership. We have been able to grow unit sales with AARP by 25% year over year now turning to renewals, this continues to be a great story for us retention rates in the third quarter improved 150 basis points to a record high of 77.7%.\nThat is amazing.\nWhile channel mix shift is the primary driver, this improvement improvement is also the result of a lot of tremendous work by our team improving customer service, expanding use of preferred contractors, getting more members on auto pay and increasing member engagement throughout the customer journey.\nFinally, one of the things I'm most excited about is the progress we're making on enhancing our customer experience in a major milestone. We launched an AHS app a few days ago. This is a big deal and we will make our formal public announcement on Thursday with easy convenient service right at their fingertips. Our members can now quickly access their account and plan, plan information, make and track their service requests, take advantage of special offers and manage their payment informa information all through the convenience of their phone.\nWe will have additional enhancements to the app over the coming months, we believe these enhancements will further differentiate American Home Shield from the competition. We are super excited about the app and I encourage everyone listening to download the app now through Google Play or the App Store. I think you'll be impressed.\nSo with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jessica for more on our record third quarter. Financials Jessica.\nJessica Ross\nThanks Bill and Good morning everyone.\nI want to start with a clear message to all of our stakeholders front doors. Financial position has never been stronger. We delivered another exceptional adjusted Eva to be we increased our full year outlook for the second time. This year, we are generating a record amount of cash and we remain focused on returning that cash to investors through share repurchases specific to our third quarter. Financial summary on slide 15, you will see that revenue increased 3% versus the prior year period to $540 million. Net income increased 40% to $100 million and adjusted EBITA increased 29% to $165 million.\nLet's take a moment to review our third quarter revenue which landed at $540 million versus our guided midpoint of about $537 million. This is a beat of almost 3 million.\nNow on slide 16, you will see gross profit increased 14% versus the prior year period to $306 million and gross profit margin improved 550 basis points to a record 57%.\nLet's now move to the adjusted EBITA bridge on slide 17, starting at the top, we had $17 million of favorable revenue conversion driven by a 4% increase in price over the prior year period.\nThis was partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. As a reminder, this includes the impact of a lower home warranty volume which was partially offset by an $11 million increase in nonwarranty sales.\nTurning to contract claims costs which decreased $21 million.\nThis was primarily driven by a lower number of service requests per customer. A transition to higher trade service fees and continued process improvement initiatives.\nLet's now take a moment to unpack each of those third quarter. Customer incidence rates were some of the lowest that we have ever seen. Primarily due to three reasons. First, we had $14 million of favorable weather as cooling degree days were down 16% versus the prior year period.\nSecond, we have made significant process improvements over the last two years and we are now executing better than ever. We are doing a better job of getting the right contractor to the right customer at the right time which results in a better customer experience and reduces cost and noise in our system.\nSome of the process improvements include a moving more of our service requests to preferred contractors. We had a record third quarter high with 85% of our jobs going to preferred contractors. This is an outstanding result, especially given that this was in the middle of our peak summer season.\nB our high cost claims review program and c leveraging our bulk purchasing power with our suppliers to optimize availability and achieve better prices.\nAnd the third reason our incidence rate is down is the transition to higher trade service fees which has resulted in a temporary and expected decline in the number of service requests per customer. As we typically see a short term change in customer behavior until they become accustomed to the new amounts.\nThe increase in trade service fees is also driving a lower net cost per service request in 2024.\nAs you may recall, our service fees are a contra cost to claims expense. On our income statement. When combined with a normalized inflationary environment, front doors. Third quarter, inflation rate was essentially flat again. This is on a net cost per service request basis. As the increase in trade service fee dollars mostly offset external inflation.\nIn summary adjusted ebita increased to $165 million which exceeded the midpoint of our outlook by $30 million.\nThe difference is primarily driven by over $10 million of favorable weather. Approximately $10 million of lower SG and a due to timing $3 million of favorable claims cost development and better than expected benefits from process improvements.\nLet's now turn to slide 18 for a review of our statement of cash flows with strong earnings comes strong cash flows, net cash provided from operating activities with a record $212 million for the nine months ended September 30th as a result of our exceptionally strong earnings and was primarily comprised of $281 million in earnings adjusted for non cash charges and $66 million in cash used for working capital.\nNet, cash used for investing activities was $31 million and was primarily comprised of capital expenditures related to investments in technology.\nNet. Cash used for financing activities was $131 million and was comprised of $119 million of share purchases as well as $13 million of scheduled debt payments.\nFree cash flow increased 56% to a record $181 million for the nine months ended September 30th.\nWe ended the quarter with $375 million in cash. This was comprised of $161 million of restricted cash and $214 million of unrestricted cash and we remain focused on using our cash to buy back shares. For example, we are extremely pleased that we were able to complete the three year $400 million share repurchase program before it expired in early September.\nThis is especially impressive since we paused share repurchases for almost a year in 2022.\nAs a reminder, last quarter, we announced our new three year $650 million share repurchase authorization that started on September 4th.\nThis amount is 63% higher than our previous three year authorization.\nNow, let's turn to our outlook on slide 19 given that there is less than two months remaining in the year. And that the fourth quarter is typically our lowest volume quarter. We are moving our outlook to point estimates versus providing ranges.\nWhile this is a departure from our standard practice for this quarter, we felt that this would help our investors better understand our estimates for the remainder of the year.\nNow, for the fourth quarter, we expect our revenue to be approximately $367 million which reflects a low single digit increase in our renewal channel. A decline of approximately 10% in our real estate channel driven by volume.\nA decline of approximately 20% in our D to C channel. Primarily due to our discounting strategy and an approximately $5 million increase in other revenue for the fourth quarter adjusted EBIDA is expected to come in at approximately 36 million.\nLet's now move to our full year outlook starting with revenue.\nWe are increasing our revenue outlook to approximately $1.83 billion or a 3% increase which includes a mid single digit increase in realized price, partially offset by a mid single digit decline in realized volume.\nThis assumes a mid single digit increase in the renewal channel.\nA roughly 15% decline in the real estate and D to C channels.\nIt also assumes other revenue which includes on demand will increase 40% to approximately $110 million.\nThe growth over the prior year is almost entirely driven by higher new HVAC sales, which is trending towards $85 million in 2024.\nOne, brief note of caution here.\nOur guide includes only a minor amount of revenue from Moen in 2024. It's still early. And while we are very excited about where this relationship can go, we will provide more details at our investor day.\nFrom a customer count perspective, we still expect the number of total home warranties to decline approximately 4% in 2024.\nAs I close my comments on the revenue outlook and bridge to our growth margin guide. I want to provide some additional context on our pricing strategy.\nWe significantly raised prices in 2022 in response to the highly inflationary environment and the dramatic increase in external costs to service our customers.\nWe were not only pricing for inflation experienced in 2022 but also for expected inflation in 2023. Since then, inflation has come in much lower than expected. But because of our model, it has taken nearly two years for those price increases to run their course. Because of that, we have now initiated a new mid single digit price increase that will slightly benefit the fourth quarter and carry over into 2025.\nNow moving to gross profit where we are raising our full year margin outlook to be approximately 53% which would be a new record for our business. However, it does incorporate several favorable items. We have taken a lot of price. We have had a lot of favorable weather and our system has not been stressed with high levels of claims.\nNow let's turn to our full year SG&A outlook which we expect to be about $605 million based on all of these inputs. We are increasing our full year adjusted EBITA guide to be approximately $430 million.\nOur full year outlook also includes $19 million of interest income and reflects stock compensation expense of approximately $27 million. And finally, we expect our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $40 million and the annual effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.\nIn summary, Front door's financial position has never been stronger. We are generating record earnings, record cash flows and we are on target to buy back a record amount of shares.\nWe are making the investments to grow this business and we are doing so from a position of strength and I am extremely excited to see how those investments will drive future growth.\nFinally, before we take your questions, I'm sure our plan for 2025 is top of mind for you, but we're not quite ready to discuss that plan today.\nThe acquisition of 210 is still pending and we want to make sure we account for that before we finalize our plan for 2025 and beyond, we will be ready to present all of those details to you at Investor Day.\nWith that. I will now turn it over to the operator to start. Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we will be conducting our question and answer session.\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad.\nA confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.\nYou may press star two. If you would like to remove your question from the queue and for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the stair keys.\nOne moment, please. While we poll for questions.\nThank you.\nOur first question is coming from Cory Carpenter with JP Morgan. Your line is life.\nCory Carpenter\nThanks and good morning Bill. I wanted to ask you about the AHS app launch. Just how do you plan on marketing and rolling that out? Any details you could provide in a bigger picture. How do you see this impacting your business over time? And then I have a follow up call for Jeff. Thank you.\nBill Cobb\nOkay. Yeah, we, we just rolled it out. I hope you downloaded Corey. It's a, it's a member focused app. So this is really designed to appeal to our members. It's all about our user experience, it's enhancing our user experience. I mean, there's some downstream benefits that it makes our service request process more efficient. People can deal directly through the app as opposed to always having to pick up the phone. So there's a lot of benefits that come from, from the user experience. And I think it's a modern, it's a modern brand move. It also can be the catalyst for further enhancements that we will have down the road. So in terms of marketing, we will be starting by, if you will marketing it to our existing members. And then as far as broad communications, I mean, I think you'll see it in action. I don't think we'll just necessarily announce we have a new app, but it's, it's going to be part of our overall brand character or brand image. So we're, we're excited about what it can do for our members. And I think the the modernity look, it'll give us broadly will help us to drive hopefully additional members.\nCory Carpenter\nThank you. And then just, just on the, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're initiating a mid single digit percent price increase, I believe. Could you just expand a bit, is that across all your channels or, or certain channels that you're targeting and kind of how you expect that to roll through the P&L in 4 June next year?\nJessica Ross\nThank you, cory with No, thanks coy with our price increases. Those are really focused through the renewal channels. So hopefully that answers your question. We roll those out through the renewals book.\nBill Cobb\nYeah, because you know, real estate, we hold pretty constant and obviously the way the market's been, we, we aren't looking at any pricing action there. And then DTC one is a part of, you know, all the discounting stuff we talked about earlier. So, as Jessica said, think of it as through the renewals channel.\nCory Carpenter\nGreat. Thank you.\nBill Cobb\nThanks Cory.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Ian Zaffino with Oppenheimer. Your line is live.\nIan Zaffino\nHi, great. Thank. Thank you very much. You know, I wanted to also ask on, on the pricing side and kind of how are you arriving at? You know, your price increases, I guess we're kind of facing some down demand. And just kind of trying to understand your decision, you know, balancing between, you know, price and volume. Thanks.\nJessica Ross\nYeah. No, I, you know, I think as I shared in my prepared remarks, we obviously priced for the high inflationary environment in 2022 as we're going forward, I mean, we definitely think that pricing should be more in line with what we're seeing from an inflation perspective. And I think, and, you know, we've also got our dynamic pricing strategy and capability that will be used as we roll that those pricing increases out amongst our renewal channel.\nBill Cobb\nSo I, and one of the things we do is we obviously monitor our, our elasticities, all the time. And, and we're fortunate as, as you heard, our retention rate continues to be quite strong in the Renewal Channel, which is, as Jessica said, is primarily where the price increases are happening in the DTC channel. We're being very aggressive on bringing in 1st year members, which is really, you know, the feeder into the, the, you know, the backbone of our business, the Renewal Book.\nIan Zaffino\nOkay, thanks. And then, you know, maybe talk about the launch of 00, of the A S fa sorry A ahsf sorry. You know, talk about the difference between that launch and maybe this this front door launch, you know, one of the differences there. And then is there any kind of concern of canalization in the front door product at all? Thanks.\nBill Cobb\nYeah. No, it's an important point to note the A HS app is designed for our existing members and is focused on the home warranty business. The front door app is, is open to anyone. And it also is the catalyst for our overall on demand business. So that is so we don't see, we see them working in tandem because they are serving different markets. So we're excited to have both as a part of the overall front door inc business. And I think they, they serve two different purposes that can work in tandem.\nIan Zaffino\nOkay. Thank you very.\nJessica Ross\nMuch.\nThanks Ian.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Sergio Segura. With Keyban. Your line is live.\nSergio Segura\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to start, I guess with the real estate channel. So it looked like the customer account, there was stable and I think revenue came in slightly above where you guys previously guided. Despite existing home sales actually declining this quarter. I was wondering if that implies any improvements you're seeing in the tax rates and maybe just more broadly, we've been stuck in a seller's market, strong seller's market for some time. Now. Are there any signs that you're seeing that we're returning to a more balanced market in real estate?\nBill Cobb\nYeah, I think overall, I, I think I credit, you know, as you said that the trend being better, notwithstanding it, it's still a very tough market, you know, that some of the execution that we've done, our, our sales team has done a, done an excellent job, you know, grinding really for, for every unit they can. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on real estate. As we said, the market continues to flounder. But there are a few elements as we talked about the the listings is now over four months worth of supply mortgage rates should continue to fall. I heard today there may be a rate cut coming very soon. We have done a good job of keeping our attach rate up. You know, relative to our, to our competition. So to your point, there are some elements that seem to be, you know, on the macro side coming our way, but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that. We've been kind of calling for this all along. We still believe the market's going to rebound, you know, all the real estate professional or, you know, experts worst market in 14 years and, and the like, so I think this is going to be a I, I, you know, I don't want to go all the way to, we'll talk about this more at Investor Day in February. I want, I don't want to call it a tailwind at this point, but I think things are stabilizing and we certainly hope they're going to turn up very soon.\nSergio Segura\nGot it that's helpful and maybe a second one on the DTC channel, we saw that the customer account re accelerated there. So congrats on that. Hoping to just talk about maybe the drivers behind that. Was that more of the marketing strategy? I think you guys talked about a more targeted marketing strategy last quarter if that was driving the results or is that more of the discounting strategy? And then, you know, related to that, we saw you guys did lower the SG&A outlook with any of that marketing spend that you're lowering there and just given the success if that is so like, why pull back when you're seeing some success in that channel. Thank you.\nBill Cobb\nSo, I love your questions. It's, it's kind of yes, yes and yes, but let me go, let me unpack that. So, and we, and we certainly wanted to talk about, you know, our Google information since you have been very keen to point out Google trends. But look, the information we got from Google is our searches are up. Discounting has been a good thing for us. Demand and conversion are up. The campaign we believe has worked very well with the awareness numbers I cited earlier. So I think that there's, there's not one element. I think the discounting is a bit of a blunt instrument, but we feel it's been effective and especially effective in terms of the long term value of the customer. So that's, that's really what we're doing. We're taking advantage of this ability for us to generate the, the IDA growth that we have to reinvest in the, in the, in the, in the brand. And that is part of what you see in Q4 that we did. We are looking to use some of the SD and A to do some incremental marketing which is really going to impact 2025. So, so yeah, I think your, your instincts are right. It is across the board and we love the trend and hopefully it'll continue.\nSergio Segura\nGreat. There you.\nOperator\nGo.\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Jeff Schmitt with William Blair. Your line is life.\nJeff Schmitt\nHi, good morning.\nQuestion on the direct channel. How much of an impact do you think your promotional strategy will have on retention rates there when prices step up for those customers? You know, I think you mentioned last quarter that, you know, that you think they'll hold up well, but is there anything new you learned there anymore that you could add on on, on how much of an impact that will have?\nBill Cobb\nYeah, so we, you know, we started the deep discounting in March of last year. So we've been tracking very closely that cohort as we go forward. Fortunately, we have seen that as we, as we start to renew when you're out, et cetera that the that the retention that, you know, renewals are, are holding that the cancel rate is not outsized relative to any anybody else. I think we'll touch on this more at Investor Day, but it's the right question to ask that. How does it impact one year later? And so far, we, we've been pleased with, with the effort on the on the 1st year renewal after the 50% off.\nJeff Schmitt\nOkay.\nAnd then how is the attachment rate in the real estate channel trending? Like where is it at today versus you know, last few quarters or even last few years? And do you have any concerns, I guess with mortgage rates, you know, sort of moving back up. They, they were heading towards six now they're, you know, going, going north. So, any, any thoughts on, if that will have an impact here?\nBill Cobb\nYeah. Let me take the first part and this, and then separate that from the second part of the, the attach rate has fallen for the industry, you know, home warranties where it used to be pretty, pretty steady at around 30% or high 20s. It's now in the 10s. What the point we're making earlier was as that has happened, we have maintained our share of of, you know, our, our fair share in terms of, you know, attachment rate, but the attachment rate has fallen and that is a concern for the industry in terms of, you know, mortgage rates and the like, I don't think it'll have any different effect than just hopefully it'll start to raise the overall market. But you know, people will see that as mortgage rates are falling. I mean, people are going to want to buy a new house, they're going to sell their old house, they want to take the equity that they have in there. So, so we see a lot of the should be natural reasons why the market will improve. But I don't think the interest rates are going to have much of an impact on, on attachment rate. I don't know, just because you have a different No.\nJessica Ross\nI think III, I agree. I think the one thing with the mortgage rates right now just as we're seeing kind of interest rates, but we see them flowing but, you know, just in recent times they're popping back up a little bit. So it'll be, we'll be cautiously optimist on that front.\nJeff Schmitt\nOkay, great. Thank you.\nBill Cobb\nJessica. Thanks, Jess.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is on.\nEric Sheridan\nThanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two. If I could just first broadly on the competitive landscape, you know, I think we talked a lot so far on the call on the demand landscape, you find yourself in, in both sides of the business. But how are you finding the competitive landscape? And where are there pockets where maybe competition is either more elevated or less elevated than maybe you anticipated when you think about the beginning of this year and how sort of 2024 laid out? And then I know we're going to get an update more broadly on the 210 acquisition at the analyst day. But any key learnings about the elements of accelerating growth in organically in the business through acquisition versus building and scaling products yourself that maybe are some of the key takeaways from 2024 that might involve inform elements of strategy into 2025 and beyond. Thanks so much.\nBill Cobb\nYeah, I'll take the first one if you want to take the second one, Jessica in terms of competition. You know, there, there are a number of our direct competitors are private companies, so we don't have a lot of information except what we can hear in the marketplace. There are a couple of, you know, public, generally it's a division of a public company. They have obviously seen our aggressive discounting and they have responded in that. I think we've been effective in that regard. So there isn't any any product enhancements or, or anything of note, I think a number of competitors are focused on the real estate business. You know, our DTC business is a higher share for us than a it is in real estate even though we're number one in both. So I think competitively, we feel like we're in, we're in, we're in good shape on that.\nYeah.\nJessica Ross\nJust from an M&A landscape you, you hit it, Eric, we are still very, very focused on 210 and what we can learn from that, I think going forward as we think about capital allocation, I always want to think about healthy in organic growth and how that balances with, you know, our focus on, on, on, on organic growth. And we're going to continue to evaluate that going forward. I think the one thing just in terms of our deal strategy, we're still looking at, you know, what's out there in the market and we'd be very focused on things that are going to grow, revenue, grow customers and grow. Ebida.\nBill Cobb\nYeah, just to be clear, Eric you know, we have a lot to absorb with the integration of 210. So there's nothing on the horizon that I would say from an acquisition perspective. I mean, we can always keep that open. We are very committed to buying back shares with with our excess cash. So it's not that we won't look at that at some point down the road. But right now, absorbing 210 is going to take a lot. It's a heavy lift for us. We're excited about what it can do. We'll talk more about it in February, but, you know, in terms of where we're going, that that's going to be our focus for the immediate future.\nEric Sheridan\nThanks so much.\nJessica Ross\nThanks, Eric.\nOperator\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Mark Hughes with Trust Securities. Your line is life.\nMark Hughes\nYeah. Thank you. Good morning.\nBill Cobb\nHey Mark.\nMark Hughes\nGood morning on the HV AC sales you've done really well. Ramping that up is, there's still potential for that to be a kind of outsized contributed to growth, rolling it out to different regions, different contractors. What, what are the dynamics there?\nBill Cobb\nYeah, I think you nailed it. What we're doing with our contract relations team, they're, they're rolling out. You know, market by market. It is a, it is a sale that you have to get the contractors on board and the contractors want to be on board because the economics that they can get from this and it's, you know, we've talked about this, you know, in the past it's a great value proposition. We give it a consumer a break. I'm a new customer of HVAC. Just installed my new, my new HVAC last week. So I can't, I can't talk about fourth quarter, I guess, Matt, but, you know, well, that'll, that'll be part of the part of the numbers.\nBut no, what, what we're doing is, you know, we were in Kansas City a couple of weeks ago, we're, we're going market by market enhancing the overall piece. We have stronger markets. And I think what we can talk about is, is kind of a full potential analysis when we get to February. But, but we think that there's a lot of, a lot of blue sky out there for HVAC and then with regard to MO and we haven't said, you know, JSIC, I put the note of caution out there. You heard me say that we're expanding seven more states. We'll have more to say about it in February. But, but we think that's on a nice build and they're a great partner and we love working with them.\nMark Hughes\nDo you think the Ming can that be material in 2025?\nThis materiality is a few points at least.\nBill Cobb\nWell, that's a great tee up with our Investor Day, February 27th in New York City that we'll talk about it more. I don't want to jump ahead just now because we're still in the middle. We, we haven't even rolled out to those additional states yet.\nJessica Ross\nI think the point is though, Mark, you hit it right. Like New HVAC, we've learned a lot from it. It's been a great growth opportunity for us And I think that's going to give us a lot of good learnings as we think about expanding into two other capabilities as well.\nMark Hughes\nIf I might ask one more, Jessica, you talked about the trade service fees, sort of dampen claims frequency until the consumer gets used to it.\nThe u usual timing of that, you know, that that process and I think you had mentioned that was maybe something that would impact the fourth quarter as well. Is that, is that fair? How long does that?\nJessica Ross\nI think? I mean, I think the way I think about it, you have to think about it is it's, we roll those out very similar to a pricing increase. So it's, you know, it's a contract item on our claims costs, but we launched that on the back half of 2022. And the process takes, you know, 1224 months to roll out. They're exactly like pricing. So as we think about pricing kind of reaching its run in Q4 tsfs are doing the same thing. And then just from a behavior perspective, it takes, typically we look at maybe a year or so for people to just get hired to that trade service fee and, and start calling in for repairs again.\nMark Hughes\nSo, is that fair to say that you, you've kind of that because it's run its course?\nJessica Ross\nYes, it's run its course. It's exactly exactly what I'm saying.\nMark Hughes\nYeah. Okay. All right. Thank.\nJessica Ross\nYou.\nThanks Mark.\nOperator\nThank you so much. We have reached the end of our question and answer session. So I will now turn the call over to Mr Bill Cobb for his closing remarks.\nBill Cobb\nThank you very much. Before we sign off, I want to reiterate some final points as you heard me say last quarter and it's worth repeating here. Our strategy and plan is about near term realism and long term optimism. While macroeconomic factors continue to challenge member growth for all home warranty providers, we remain very bullish about this category and especially our strategy to continue driving awareness and consideration.\nThere are millions of untapped homeowners who could benefit from a home warranty as well as our on demand offerings like the new HVAC program that said, I'd like you to reflect on what's been accomplished over the past two years. We have focused on customer growth and we're seeing positive momentum on our campaign and the relaunch of the American Home Shield brand. These efforts are working and as I mentioned earlier, we now expect our annual DTC customer count to be in line with last year.\nWe've also explored strategic M&A to accelerate our growth and the acquisition of 210 that's proceeding on track to close in Q4.\nWe have enhanced our margins. We continue to drive high customer attention rates with the third quarter, setting a record at 77.7%.\nWe've expanded our on demand business. It's doing very well through HVAC sales as well as our growing partnerships with Moen and others.\nAnd finally, we continue to return excess cash to shareholders through share buybacks and with our new $650 million share repurchase authorization, we remain committed to continuing share repurchases so you can see a lot has been accomplished. We've done what we said we would do on that note. I hope these facts and the results of another absolutely amazing quarter of financial performance are giving you good reason to believe in front door for the long term. Thank you and I look forward to seeing all of you in New York on February 27th for our investor day. Thanks again.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect at this time and we thank you for your participation.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss.\nArtificial Intelligence is a game changer. According to a PwC report, it could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity while $9.1 trillion is from consumption-side effects. The report also reveals that global GDP will be up to 14% higher in 2030 due to the accelerating development of AI. The greatest productivity gains are likely to go to North America and China, with the former expected to realize the AI benefits faster.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\nHowever, the surge in artificial intelligence will require a huge number of data centers, and it is significantly going to impact how much the world consumes power, and how much that is going to cost. To have an idea, on average, a ChatGPT search needs as much as 10 times more electricity to process as a Google search. That said, AI gathering steam is only going to make the power hunger crazier. According to estimates from Goldman Sachs, the data center demand is going to grow 160% by 2030. Presently, data centers consume about 1-2% of overall power, but the percentage is likely to rise to 3-4% by the end of the decade.\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAs we examine the increasing energy demand of data centers stemming from the surge in AI, it\u2019s worth noting how these advancements are manifesting in practical applications. In its latest breakthrough, Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company that builds reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems, has launched Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u2014their first release in the forthcoming Claude 3.5 model family. The Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency (HumanEval), demonstrating marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural and relatable tone.\nAnother exciting news is how Runway, an AI company shaping the next era of art, entertainment, and human creativity, has launched a new set of advanced AI camera controls for its Gen-3 Alpha Turbo video generation model. These tools allow the user generating videos from text prompts, upload images, or even their footage, to have greater control over the AI-generated settings and characters. Users can even zoom in or out of the scene and subjects without disrupting their realism, creating a more immersive experience of a seemingly 3D world.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, a highly anticipated release that many have been waiting on is seemingly delayed, as per the latest reports. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that his company\u2019s next big model won\u2019t likely be released this year. According to Altman, the company is \"prioritizing\" shipping existing models focused on reasoning and difficult questions.\n\u201cAll of these models have gotten quite complex and we can\u2019t ship as many things in parallel as we\u2019d like to\u201d. He said the company faces \u201climitations and hard decisions\u201d when it comes to allocating compute resources \u201ctowards many great ideas.\u201d - Altman wrote during a Reddit AMA.\nWhen asked about the release of ChatGPT-5, Altman stated that the company has some very good releases this year but \u201cnothing that we are going to call GPT-5.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Unveils Enhanced Google Maps with AI-Powered Gemini Chatbot, Improving Contextual Search and Accuracy\nPhoto by Kai Wenzel on Unsplash\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a multinational technology company that wholly owns the internet giant Google, along with other businesses. Google, its subsidiary, has been leveraging artificial intelligence technology for years, from building AI infrastructure to embedding its Gemini AI model tools and chatbot AI technology into its search engine, and much more.\nOn Thursday, October 31, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s Google announced a set of features incorporating Gemini, its artificial intelligence chatbot, into its suite of mapping applications. The new category of search results is better able to process open-ended queries, whereas the past version of Googe Maps could only respond to queries with generic results, which were not as accurate. According to Miriam Daniel, vice president in charge of consumer experiences for Google Maps, Gemini is better able to understand context such as time of day, or season. To avoid hallucinations in its responses, the responses from Gemini will be cross-referenced against real-world data that Google has collected.\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "A coalition of U.S. technology companies has expressed concerns to Vietnams government, cautioning that a proposed data law could hinder social media and data center operators from expanding in the country, according to a report by Reuters.\nOwned by Meta Platforms (META, Financials), Vietnam, a major market for platforms like Facebook, wants to draw international capital to support its data center sector in the next years. The proposed rule, however, is meant to restrict data transfers overseas and increase government access to information, possibly complicating operations for overseas technology companies.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nThough these words are still vague, the lawnow under parliamentary reviewwould need businesses to get prior permission to export \"core data\" and \"important data\" abroad. Chair of the Information Technology Industry Council Jason Oxman, representing companies including Meta, Alphabet's Google (GOOGL, Financials), and Equinix (EQIX, Financials), said the measure \"would make it difficult for tech companies, social media platforms, and data center operators to reach the users who rely on their services daily.\"\nThough enforcement has been erratic, Vietnam's current regulations restrict cross-border data flows in particular circumstances. The proposed bill would increase these restrictions, mandating businesses to provide data to government and state entities in a spectrum of broadly defined scenarios, such as completing duties judged in the public interest.\nThough the timetable may alter, Vietnamese legislators are supposed to vote on the measure by Nov. 30, Reuters said. Should it be approved, the bill would bring Vietnam into step with nations such as China and the European Union, which limit cross-border data flows to improve data security and privacy.\nCiting the dangers of \"undue expansion\" of control, the U.S. IT industry has strongly objected to the law's possibility for more government data access. With reports in August showing Google is considering building a data center in Vietnaman investment that would be the first by a significant U.S. tech business in the nation Vietnam is now assessing proposals from big American tech players.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The biggest spenders will be Amazon and Microsoft, spending $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively.\n\"In all, we now expect AMZN/GOOGL/META/MSFT to spend ~$300bn/$335b+ in '25/'26 as they continue to invest in the multi-year GenAI and LLM-enabled opportunities,\" Nowak commented. \"These high and rising capex numbers again speak to the importance of continued disclosure about new/incremental adoption, engagement, and revenue opportunities each of the four companies are seeing and investing in.\"\nThe biggest beneficiary from all the new spending is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which makes the high-end AI chips needed to power the massive new infrastructure.\nBofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya expects Nvidia to get over 75% of the AI accelerator market share through 2027. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are both expected to get in the mid-single digit share.\n\"We continue to expect the AI accelerator to grow to $280bn by CY27E (and over time toward $400bn+) from just ~$45bn in CY23,\" Arya commented.\nRelated Articles\nHyperscalers' massive 2025 capex hike for AI means big wins for NVIDIA\nExxon Mobil, Tesla lead Monday's market cap stock movers\n6 key chip stocks to own as per Mizuho's Klein\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently delved into the complexities of disappointing quarterly earnings, emphasizing the importance of transparent communication from management. He pointed out that during each earnings season, evaluating companies can vary significantly in difficulty. Cramer remarked that when grading these results, investors seek clarity and simplicity, wanting reports that are easy to understand rather than muddled and confusing.\nLast Wednesday, Cramer posed a thought-provoking question, noting that while stocks have the potential to generate substantial profits, the recent earnings reports have made it clear that not all results are straightforward.\n\u201cStocks can make you a lot of money, can't they? But after another day full of earnings where the Dow fell 92 points, S&P dipped 0.33% and Nasdaq declined 0.56%, it is worth remembering that most of these quarterly report cards aren't that clean, not that simple.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nCramer likened the reporting process to navigating a complicated landscape where quick, headline-driven summaries often fail to capture essential nuances, which can lead to significant misunderstandings and even crises in interpretation.\nHe explained that many companies faced a series of challenges in their earnings reports, asserting that every disappointing quarter has its unique characteristics, complicating the assessment process. Cramer illustrated this by comparing the situation to a criminal trial, where a defendant who is clearly guilty but refuses a plea deal might face severe consequences. He emphasized that for CEOs, acknowledging mistakes is crucial; failing to address poor results could lead to a perception that they do not take the reporting process seriously.\n\u201cBottom line, memo to CEOs everywhere: each gutter ball, every strike out, must be explained or we\u2019ll be concerned that you simply don\u2019t take the process seriously. If you don\u2019t want to face the music, then you need to give us the happy family of good results and a sunny forecast. When you can't do that, you at least need to straightforwardly admit that you were wrong.\u201d\nJim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks\nJim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on October 30. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nJim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks\n7. Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\nCramer commented that one of his favorites, Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) did not report its usual solid quarterly earnings. Here\u2019s what he said about the results and the reaction of the market to them:\n\u201cFinally, there are the unhappiest of shortfalls, the ones that management simply refuses to acknowledge, either because they're in a state of denial or they're full of it. And that's what I thought as I read the conference call for Wingstop\u2026 one of my favorites. Every quarter they give you an Acme dynamite set of earnings and a rosy forecast, sensational same-store sales. Today though, Wingstop dwelled on the good, not blowout, same-store sales and didn't even mention the out and out earnings shortfall. 88 cents, looking for 96. Funny thing about Wall Street, the only thing it hates more than a big miss is when management tries to pretend the big miss didn't happen. Hence why Wingstop plunged 21% today.\u201d\nWingstop (NASDAQ:WING) is a restaurant franchise that operates under the Wingstop brand, specializing in classic and boneless wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches, all hand-sauced and tossed in a variety of flavors. The company promotes itself as \"The Wing Experts\" and employs an asset-light franchise model.\nAs of September 28, the company has established a presence with 2,458 restaurants globally, including 2,120 locations in the United States. Of these, 2,064 are franchised, while 56 are company-owned. Internationally, there are 338 franchised restaurants in various markets.\nFor the fiscal third quarter, the company reported revenue of $162.5 million, marking a significant increase from $117.1 million the previous year, a growth of 38.8%. The net income for the same period reached $25.7 million, a rise of 31.9% and diluted EPS stood at $0.88. The company's system-wide sales also saw a considerable boost, rising by 39.4% to $1.2 billion. Despite these impressive figures, rising input costs, particularly related to bone-in chicken wings, led to an increased cost of sales, which reached 77.8%.\nOn October 31, BMO Capital lowered the price target on Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) to $335 from $360 and maintained a Market Perform rating. As per the firm, the company's third-quarter earnings per share fell short of expectations due to slightly weaker comparable store sales, diminished restaurant margins, and increased general and administrative costs.\nThe firm added that although the current business momentum for the company remains strong and its long-term outlook is positive, concerns about decelerating comparable sales may impact share performance until there is clearer stabilization in the market.\n6. Reddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\nCramer commended Reddit, Inc.'s (NYSE:RDDT) third-quarter results and credited the stock gaining to its \u201cprofitable quarter\u201d.\n\u201cIdeally, we hope for companies like Reddit, our guest last night. Wall Street was expecting it to be a money loser with little growth. Instead, we got a highly profitable quarter with a modest growth. And that's why the stock\u2019s soared 42%.\u201d\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) operates a dynamic platform that fosters the creation and engagement of digital communities centered around diverse interests, allowing users to participate in discussions and share various types of content. The company reported its Q3 results on October 29 and the stock has been up over 38% since then, as of November 1.\nThe company exceeded Wall Street expectations by reporting earnings that showed substantial growth. It achieved revenue of $348 million, which showed a remarkable year-over-year increase of 68%. This performance resulted in a positive earnings per diluted share of $0.16, a significant turnaround from a previous net loss of $0.13. User engagement on Reddit has also seen considerable growth, with active user counts increasing by 51% in the U.S. and 44% in international markets.\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) management attributed this surge in part to advancements in machine translation, which has led to four times the incremental growth in daily users. The company plans to extend this technology to additional countries, which is expected to further drive user engagement. Additionally, the average revenue per user (ARPU) grew by 14% globally, contributing to a 56% boost in worldwide advertising sales, which remains the primary driver of the company's growth.\nIn a notable development, the company's smaller revenue category, labeled \"other revenue,\" experienced a dramatic increase of 547%, primarily fueled by the expansion of its artificial intelligence business. This segment includes data licensing partnerships that have become increasingly significant. During the earnings call, COO Jen Wong highlighted that the company licenses its user data to facilitate advertising analytics and to assist in training large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems.\n5. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 100\nOn Wednesday, talking about his favorite, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Cramer expressed disappointment with the company\u2019s recent earnings report. Here\u2019s what Mad Money\u2019s host had to say:\n\u201cThen there's Cramer fave, Eli Lilly. Here's the stock that's been almost as hot as Nvidia. It's up 45% for the year, even after today's hideous 6.2% collapse. Given how much Lilly had run into the quarter, we needed to see some extraordinary numbers from the revolutionary GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss, right?... And we also needed them to raise their forecast dramatically, but we got nothing like that. Instead, Lily reported a clear miss, a real whiff. And the explanation for it was totally opaque. I'm still trying to figure out what the heck happened. Was it too much supply? Too little demand? Stock finished about $56. One point, it was down a hundred. Talk about an unhappy forecast.\u201d\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is a prominent global pharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming diabetes care and addressing obesity and its serious long-term effects. A shining star in its product line is Zepbound, a new treatment for obesity that activates specific hormone receptors, offering a fresh approach in this therapeutic area. Another significant product is Mounjaro, the first approved medication for type 2 diabetes targeting these same receptors, utilizing tirzepatide as its active ingredient. These medications, also known as GLP-1 agonists, function by activating receptors for hormones released after eating, helping individuals feel fuller.\nIn the third quarter, the company reported sales of $11.44 billion. The company noted that U.S. sales for both Mounjaro and Zepbound were adversely affected by a decrease in inventories within the wholesaler channel.\nDuring the Q3 earnings call, CFO Lucas Montarce explained that wholesalers had reduced their inventories of diabetes and obesity drugs during the quarter, describing it as a temporary issue. He emphasized that demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound remains strong and continues to grow. CEO David Ricks also highlighted a 25% increase in U.S. prescription volume for these medications from the second to the third quarter.\nFor 2024, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) anticipates a non-GAAP EPS between $13.02 and $13.52, having previously forecast a full-year non-GAAP EPS of $16.10 to $16.60. This adjustment is primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic Holdings, which impacted in-process research and development charges by $3.09 billion, or $3.33 per share. For the third quarter, these charges amounted to $2.83 billion, or $3.08 per share, mainly associated with the Morphic Holdings acquisition.\n4. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\nCramer remarked that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) performed well enough in its third quarter but not exceptionally well while highlighting the company\u2019s difficulties with supply chain constraints.\n\u201cNow, we're trying to buy it for my Charitable Trust. Last night, AMD reported an extraordinary quarter, numbers I could never have imagined a year ago, two years ago. Back then, I would've thought that making $2 billion in artificial intelligence chips would be incredible and now it looks like they\u2019ll do $5 billion. But traders don't care about the quarter, that's now in the rearview mirror. Do they? They care about the next quarter and the next 12 months for that matter. And on that basis, AMD did well, but not well enough.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a prominent player in the semiconductor sector, recognized for its innovative processors and graphics solutions that cater to a wide range of applications, including personal computers and data centers. Competing with major companies like Intel and Nvidia, it operates through key business segments such as Client, Data Center, Gaming, and Embedded, with a strong emphasis on high-performance and adaptive computing technologies.\nIt should be noted that during the earnings call, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su discussed the ongoing challenges in the supply chain environment, commenting that the company has effectively managed its capacity. She acknowledged that while supply tightness is expected to persist in the upcoming quarters, the company has outlined plans for significant growth heading into 2025.\nFor the fourth quarter, the company expects revenue to be around $7.5 billion, with a possible variance of $300 million, indicating a projected growth of 22% at the midpoint.\nAdditionally, the company has revised its full-year GPU data center revenue forecast from over $4.5 billion to now exceeding $5 billion. Looking toward 2025, the company remains optimistic about continued growth in the data center segment, driven by substantial investments from companies aiming to expand their infrastructure for AI workloads. The company also mentioned that customers are increasingly diversifying the workloads they run on its GPUs.\n3. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nDuring last Wednesday's Mad Money episode, Cramer acknowledged that he did not have many expectations from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) previously but highlighted that its recent quarterly earnings report reminded him of the \u201cold Google\u201d.\n\u201cAlphabet defines the happy beat and raise. This stock had been the laggard in the Mag 7. Nobody expected much from it at all, I didn't. I mean we own it for the trust, but I didn't. The company has a really bad habit of giving you a muddled message even when it's doing well.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) provides a wide range of products and services through its segments, including advertising, cloud services, communication tools, and various platforms like YouTube and Google Play, catering to both consumer and enterprise needs. As per Statcounter Global Stats, Google Search holds the primary position among search engines as its market share is 89.33%.\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud achieved significant revenue growth of 35%, reaching $11.4 billion. The company noted that customers are increasingly adopting its AI platform for building and customizing models, with the Gemini model gaining notable popularity. Management highlighted the success of its data platform BigQuery, alongside AI-driven cybersecurity solutions like Google Threat Intelligence and Security Operations, which have expanded the company's application portfolio.\nIn addition to cloud services, Google Search has also shown strong performance, with revenue rising over 12% to more than $49 billion. The company noted particular strength among financial services providers, including insurance companies, and retailers. AI capabilities are helping the company gain deeper insights into user behavior, allowing for better connections between users and advertisers.\nMeanwhile, YouTube has achieved significant milestones, with total ad and subscription revenues exceeding $50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time, driven by offerings such as YouTube TV, NFL Sunday Ticket, and YouTube Music Premium.\n2. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nCramer delved into Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) third-quarter earnings report that was released on October 30. Here\u2019s what he had to say about it:\n\u201cMeta stock instantly plunged about 20 bucks when it reported because there was no beat and raise lingo. Remember we like that stuff spoon-fed because we're lazy. I had to bat this one around for a while with the crew because there are puts and takes to the guidance. That's another technical term, puts and takes\u2026 And I still can't be sure that it should be down so much. It's coining money for heaven's sake. Again, hard to pin down. A non-beaten, non raiser that made the numbers.\u201d\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a global leader in connecting people through a variety of products that allow for sharing and interaction on mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables. The company boasts an audience of 3.29 billion daily active users across its platforms. The majority of its revenue comes from selling advertising space to businesses looking to reach this extensive audience. As users engage more with platforms like Facebook and Instagram, the number of advertisements they encounter increases, driving revenue growth.\nIn Q3, Meta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) advertising revenue climbed nearly 19%, totaling $39.9 billion. The company has projected its fourth-quarter revenue between $45 billion and $48 billion. Additionally, a notable rise in capital expenditures is expected in 2025, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of investing in artificial intelligence and infrastructure for future growth.\nManagement mentioned that AI plays a crucial role in boosting user engagement and time spent on its platforms, while also providing tools for advertisers to improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and boost conversion rates. The company highlighted advancements in its Llama large language model, which has seen significant growth in tokens, aiding in AI computations. Training for Llama 4 is currently underway, utilizing a cluster that is bigger than 100,000 H100 graphic processing units.\n1. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nTalking about Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) solid quarter during last Wednesday\u2019s episode, Cramer highlighted the company surpassing the estimates and advised to focus on the forward guidance.\n\u201cMicrosoft traded up initially on the strength of the results for the reporting quarter, including a top and bottom line beat, plus, much better than expected growth for its Azure cloud computing business. It grew 33%, Wall Street's looking for 29 and 12 points of that growth came from the company's AI offerings. That said, anyone trading Microsoft now's being reckless. As I told you, many times, many times the success of each Microsoft quarter is usually determined by the company's forward guidance, which they don't give us until\u2026 the conference call that's going on right now.\u201d\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading technology company that develops and supports a wide range of software, services, devices, and solutions. Its portfolio includes productivity applications, business solutions, cloud services, operating systems, hardware, and gaming products.\nAccording to IBISWorld, the company has a noteworthy market share in around 18 industries. It holds the largest market share in the Database, Storage, and Backup Software Publishing industry, representing approximately 56.0% of the total revenue in this sector.\nFor fiscal Q2 2025, the company\u2019s management expects growth for its Azure cloud services to range between 31% and 32%, marking a deceleration from the previous quarter's 34% growth rate. Overall, revenue for the Intelligent Cloud segment is projected to increase by 18% to 20% year over year.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) management projected that sales from AI-related products are expected to remain consistent with last quarter's performance. The company is optimistic about Azure's potential to accelerate in the latter half of the fiscal year, driven by new investments in data center capacity that are set to come online.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure.

          "whole_article": "Have you evaluated the performance of Alphabet's (GOOGL) international operations for the quarter ending September 2024? Given the extensive global presence of this internet search leader, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\nIn today's increasingly interconnected global economy, a company's ability to tap into international markets can be a pivotal factor in shaping its overall financial health and growth trajectory. For investors, understanding a company's reliance on overseas markets has become increasingly crucial, as it offers insights into the company's sustainability of earnings, ability to tap into diverse economic cycles and overall growth potential.\nBeing present in foreign markets serves as protection against local economic declines and helps benefit from more rapidly expanding economies. Yet, such expansion also introduces challenges related to currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varied market behaviors.\nWhile delving into GOOGL's performance for the past quarter, we observed some fascinating trends in the revenue from its foreign segments that are commonly modeled and observed by analysts on Wall Street.\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $74.55 billion, marking an increase of 16.4% from the year-ago quarter. We will next turn our attention to dissecting GOOGL's international revenue to get a clearer picture of how significant its operations are outside its main base.\nA Closer Look at GOOGL's Revenue Streams Abroad\nAPAC generated $14.55 billion in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 19.51% of the total. This represented a surprise of +3.47% compared to the $14.06 billion projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, APAC accounted for $13.82 billion (19.37%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $13.13 billion (20.49%) to the total revenue.\nOther Americas (Canada and Latin America) accounted for 6.83% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $5.09 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -31.61%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $7.45 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Other Americas (Canada and Latin America) contributed $4.94 billion (6.92%) and $4.55 billion (7.11%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nOf the total revenue, $25.47 billion came from EMEA during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 34.17%. This represented a surprise of +4.31% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $24.42 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $24.68 billion, or 34.59%, and $22.66 billion, or 35.38%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nStory Continues\nRevenue Projections for Overseas Markets\nWall Street analysts expect Alphabet to report $81.34 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. APAC, Other Americas (Canada and Latin America) and EMEA are expected to contribute 19% ($15.41 billion), 6.9% ($5.57 billion) and 34.3% ($27.88 billion) to the total revenue, respectively.\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $298.73 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 16.5% from the year before. The revenues from APAC, Other Americas (Canada and Latin America) and EMEA are expected to make up 18.9%, 7.6% and 33.7% of this total, corresponding to $56.58 billion, $22.61 billion and $100.77 billion respectively.\nIn Conclusion\nRelying on global markets for revenues presents both prospects and challenges for Alphabet. Therefore, scrutinizing its international revenue trends is key to effectively forecasting the company's future outlook.\nIn an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\nAt Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.\nBoasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\nAt present, Alphabet holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This ranking implies that its near-term performance might beat the overall market movement. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nExamining the Latest Trends in Alphabet's Stock Value\nOver the past month, the stock has seen an increase of 2.5% in its value, whereas the Zacks S&P 500 composite has posted an increase of 0.4%. The Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Alphabet's industry group, has ascended 2.1% over the identical span. In the past three months, there's been an increase of 4.7% in the company's stock price, against a rise of 5.5% in the S&P 500 index.

The company reported impressive third-quarter 2024 results, wherein both earnings and revenues grew on a year-over-year basis. Revenue growth was driven by growing leisure travel demand. Substantial improvement in its booking trends was a major tailwind.\nStrong momentum across its merchants and advertising, and other businesses contributed well to top-line growth. The growing alternative accommodation business was a tailwind for the company. Solid growth in rental car and airline ticket units was a positive. The uptick in booked room nights is contributing well to the gross bookings growth.\nStory Continues\nHowever, sluggishness in its agency business remains a concern. The declining trend in agency bookings is a major headwind. Also, geopolitical tensions and market uncertainties remain concerning for the company.\n(You can read the full research report on Booking here >>>)\nUnion Pacific's shares have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the year-to-date period (-3.6% vs. -3.2%). The company is suffering big time as ecommerce sales have normalized and consumer markets have softened.\nGeopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment. Reduced fuel surcharge revenues, too, are a concern. Due to these headwinds, volumes declined 1% year over year in 2023.\nOperating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated 220 basis points in 2023, mainly due to revenue woes. Given the soft freight market scenario, the revenue weakness is likely to persist. To combat the revenue weakness, UNP is looking to cut costs. In the meantime, the railroad operator continues paying dividends.\nUNP is also active on the buyback front. Management expects to buyback shares worth $1.5 billion in 2024. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>>)\nShares of NVE have gained +14.4% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry's gain of +73.2%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $364.3 million pivoted to direct sales which lifted its gross margin year over year to 86% in second-quarter fiscal 2025, enhancing profitability and resilience in slowdowns.\nContract R&D revenues, largely from a defense contract, surged 3,950% year over year, creating a high-margin stream with potential defense sales. A $4-$5 million investment in advanced packaging strengthens self-sufficiency and growth capacity. Innovations like the ALT521-10E sensor help the company tap into the industrial and medical markets.\nYet, product sales dropped 14% year over year due to distributor inventory buildup and weak demand, pressuring revenues. Rising R&D and SG&A expenses, combined with cash declines from capex and dividends, squeeze profits. Dividend sustainability concerns grow amid profit pressures. A higher tax rate and distributor inventory risks could further impact earnings.\n(You can read the full research report on NVE here >>>)\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

          "whole_article": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +2.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 2.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +29.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.8% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8 points to a change of +37.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.6%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.91 indicates a change of +11.4% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Alphabet.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $81.34 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.5%. The $298.73 billion and $334.56 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.5% and +12%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $74.55 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.55 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $72.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +15.85%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 4, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.\nMicrosoft, Amazon or Alphabet: Who's Winning the Cloud Race?\nAs cloud computing transforms the digital landscape, industry giants Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet dominate the race with their respective cloud platforms\u2014Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. Each company has invested heavily in AI, data storage, and innovative technologies to attract business clients and capture greater market share. Today, Amazon leads the group in cloud market share with 31% of the market, then Microsoft with 20% followed by Alphabet with 12%.\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, in the third quarter of 2024, spending on global cloud infrastructure services surged by $15.7 billion, or 23%, over the same period in 2023, reaching over $84 billion for the quarter ending September 30. Over the last year, revenue from cloud infrastructure services hit $313 billion, underscoring the intense competition in this sector. Despite its massive scale, the cloud market continues to expand rapidly, with year-over-year (YoY) growth accelerating for the fourth straight quarter.\nAll three of these stocks reported earnings this week, with the results of their cloud services segments under the microscope. Amazon and Alphabet had positive reactions to their earnings results, while Microsoft saw some selling following its meeting. All companies had very positive results though, beating sales and earnings estimates. Also notable, Amazon stock has outperformed the market year-to-date (YTD), while Alphabet is about in line with market performance and Microsoft below.\nAMZN, GOOGL and MSFT Earnings Revisions\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have each made significant strides in cloud computing, but their earnings revision trends and growth forecasts tell slightly different stories. Both Amazon and Microsoft currently hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a relatively flat earnings revision trend. On the other hand, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting a more favorable outlook driven by recent upward revisions to its earnings estimates.\nLooking at long-term earnings growth projections, Amazon stands out with an anticipated annual growth rate of 27.2% over the next three to five years led by AWS. Alphabet's expected growth rate of 17.6% per year reflects its continued growth in cloud services, YouTube and now self-driving with Waymo, while Microsoft, expected to grow at 14.7% annually, showcases steady gains in both its cloud and software offerings, including Azure and Office 365.\nStory Continues\nTheir valuation also offers valuable insight into what investors can expect going forward. Today, Alphabet is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.4x which is below its 10-year median of 25.8x, Amazon at 38.4x is also below its 10-year median of 92.4x and Microsoft at 31.2x is above its 10-year median of 26.5x.\nAMZN, GOOGL or MSFT: Which Shares Should Investors Buy?\nFor investors seeking the best mix of growth potential and value, GOOGL and AMZN stand out as the most attractive choices among the cloud giants. Both companies not only boast strong earnings growth projections\u2014with Amazon leading the group\u2014but also offer relatively appealing valuations compared to Microsoft discounting for growth forecasts and historical valuations.\nAlphabet's recent performance in the cloud segment and ongoing investments in AI and self-driving cars show huge promise, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio remains appealing given its growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Amazon's growth prospects are bolstered by its dominant position in e-commerce and the ever-expanding AWS, which remains a leader in the cloud infrastructure market. Additionally, Amazon's valuation is more favorable relative to its growth rate and historical average, making it an attractive option for those focused on long-term potential.\nIn contrast, Microsoft's substantial capital expenditures on AI and other tech advancements\u2014though expected to drive future growth\u2014have been flagged as a point of concern for now. While Microsoft remains a cloud and AI powerhouse, these elevated costs could temper near-term returns, making it comparatively less compelling at current valuations.\nOverall, Alphabet and Amazon's mix of robust growth forecasts and favorable valuations make them top picks in the cloud landscape for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 4, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\nBreaking Down Mag 7 Earnings Results\nOf the six members of 'The Magnificent 7' group of stocks that have reported September-quarter results already, the market didn't like three \u2013 Apple, Microsoft and Meta \u2013 but loved the Teslareport and liked what it saw from Alphabet and Amazon.\nThe group ceded its market leadership role a few months back, and these mixed results can be interpreted to mean that the trend is now here to stay. In other words, the group's unambiguous market leadership of last year and early this year is now firmly behind us.\nI want to push back on part of this narrative, as most Mag 7 stocks provide some of the most sustainable growth performances in the entire market.\nAside from Apple, which is likely no longer a growth company, the other Mag 7 companies are not only generating impressive top- and bottom-line growth today, but the trend is expected to remain in place at least through next year, if not beyond.\nTake the case of Apple, which beat consensus estimates and whose Q3 earnings increased +8.8% from the year-earlier level to almost $25 billion on +6.1% higher revenues of nearly $95 billion. Apple may no longer command the growth pace of its peers like Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta, but it enjoys a degree of market dominance that is hard to dislodge by its competitors, let alone start-ups.\nMicrosoft's Q3 earnings were up +10.7% on +16% higher revenues, while Meta's earnings increased +35.4% on +18.9% revenue growth. Both companies beat top- and bottom-line consensus estimates.\nIf one was nitpicking the results from these two companies, then signs of deceleration in Microsoft's cloud revenues and Meta's advertising revenues would be the only operating issues here. Is that the issue in the Microsoft and Meta reports, or is there something else at play?\nThe answer to that question lies in what Microsoft and Meta are doing to prepare for the artificial intelligence (AI) world. Each of them is heavily investing in building AI infrastructure, and the amounts involved are massive and bigger than many in the markets had been expecting.\nIn fact, Microsoft and Meta are hardly alone in this boat, as Alphabet and Amazon are spending as heavily on AI infrastructure as these two.\nIn fact, Apple is the lone laggard in this regard, though it has started talking more about the AI capabilities embedded in its coming software upgrades that will require users to have the newest iPhones. However, we should remember that unlike Apple, which is solely a consumer-facing operator whose AI functionalities will be targeted at consumers, the other Mag 7 players primarily target businesses with their AI offerings.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet and Amazon have been able to explain and show the impact and contribution of AI spending level on its current and coming growth trajectory this earnings season. Microsoft and Meta didn't do a good job on that front.\nWe have no reason to think that these otherwise very well-run companies are throwing good money on questionable projects. As such, we like these companies investing in their future that will ensure their primacy and leadership status in the AI-centric future world. In other words, we think the market's capex fixation is overdone.\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q3 earnings for the Technology sector are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +11.4% higher revenues. Please note that had it not been for the big hit that Intel took in Q3, earnings growth for the sector would be +30.5%.\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks in the forefront of the rising estimates trend.\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nThrough Friday, November 1st, we have seen Q3 results from 350 S&P 500 members, or 70% of the index's total membership. With 104 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week, we will have seen Q3 results from more than 90% of the index's membership.\nTotal earnings for these 350 companies that have reported are up +8.8% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues, with 74.9% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 60.6% beating revenue estimates.\nThe proportion of these 350 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 50.3%.\nAs you can see above, the growth trend appears to be stable and positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter average for this group of companies, with the Q3 revenue beats percentage just a hair above the low point for the preceding 20-quarter period.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +6.8% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\nThe Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.\nHad it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +9.2% instead of +6.8%. Excluding the Tech sector's substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be only +2% instead of +6.8%.\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +1.3% instead of +6.8%.\nFor the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues.\nUnlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better.\nPlease note that this year's +7.5% earnings growth improves to +9.5% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Tech Flexes Earnings Power: A Closer Look\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nDue mostly to the new Microsoft contract, CoreWeave, which offers cloud services renting access to Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) AI chips, predicts its revenue will be around $8 billion next year. CoreWeave expects revenue of roughly $2 billion in 2024 and operating profitability.\nThis investment fits Microsoft's more general plan to increase its capacity to run advanced AI models using alliances, therefore strengthening its AI infrastructure. With CoreWeave's AI-specific infrastructure, Microsoft can seek greater high-performance computing capabilities, placing CoreWeave as a rival to Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) and Amazon (AMZN, Financials) in the cloud services market.\nThis cooperation could change the competitiveness in the cloud sector by stressing the requirement of specialized artificial intelligence infrastructure to satisfy rising computing needs.\nBesides the CoreWeave investment, Microsoft has started several projects to strengthen its artificial intelligence and cloud solutions.\nTo satisfy the rising demand for artificial intelligence and cloud services, Microsoft has greatly raised capital expendituresreaching $20 billion in the latest quarter. This covers expenditures on data centers and infrastructure connected to artificial intelligence to enable tools driven by Azure and other services.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Cramer illustrated this by comparing the situation to a criminal trial, where a defendant who is clearly guilty but refuses a plea deal might face severe consequences. He emphasized that for CEOs, acknowledging mistakes is crucial; failing to address poor results could lead to a perception that they do not take the reporting process seriously.\n\u201cBottom line, memo to CEOs everywhere: each gutter ball, every strike out, must be explained or we\u2019ll be concerned that you simply don\u2019t take the process seriously. If you don\u2019t want to face the music, then you need to give us the happy family of good results and a sunny forecast. When you can't do that, you at least need to straightforwardly admit that you were wrong.\u201d\nJim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks\nJim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on October 30. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nJim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks\n7. Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\nCramer commented that one of his favorites, Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) did not report its usual solid quarterly earnings. Here\u2019s what he said about the results and the reaction of the market to them:\n\u201cFinally, there are the unhappiest of shortfalls, the ones that management simply refuses to acknowledge, either because they're in a state of denial or they're full of it. And that's what I thought as I read the conference call for Wingstop\u2026 one of my favorites. Every quarter they give you an Acme dynamite set of earnings and a rosy forecast, sensational same-store sales. Today though, Wingstop dwelled on the good, not blowout, same-store sales and didn't even mention the out and out earnings shortfall. 88 cents, looking for 96. Funny thing about Wall Street, the only thing it hates more than a big miss is when management tries to pretend the big miss didn't happen. Hence why Wingstop plunged 21% today.\u201d\nWingstop (NASDAQ:WING) is a restaurant franchise that operates under the Wingstop brand, specializing in classic and boneless wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches, all hand-sauced and tossed in a variety of flavors. The company promotes itself as \"The Wing Experts\" and employs an asset-light franchise model.\nAs of September 28, the company has established a presence with 2,458 restaurants globally, including 2,120 locations in the United States. Of these, 2,064 are franchised, while 56 are company-owned. Internationally, there are 338 franchised restaurants in various markets.\nFor the fiscal third quarter, the company reported revenue of $162.5 million, marking a significant increase from $117.1 million the previous year, a growth of 38.8%. The net income for the same period reached $25.7 million, a rise of 31.9% and diluted EPS stood at $0.88. The company's system-wide sales also saw a considerable boost, rising by 39.4% to $1.2 billion. Despite these impressive figures, rising input costs, particularly related to bone-in chicken wings, led to an increased cost of sales, which reached 77.8%.\nOn October 31, BMO Capital lowered the price target on Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) to $335 from $360 and maintained a Market Perform rating. As per the firm, the company's third-quarter earnings per share fell short of expectations due to slightly weaker comparable store sales, diminished restaurant margins, and increased general and administrative costs.\nThe firm added that although the current business momentum for the company remains strong and its long-term outlook is positive, concerns about decelerating comparable sales may impact share performance until there is clearer stabilization in the market.\n6. Reddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\nCramer commended Reddit, Inc.'s (NYSE:RDDT) third-quarter results and credited the stock gaining to its \u201cprofitable quarter\u201d.\n\u201cIdeally, we hope for companies like Reddit, our guest last night. Wall Street was expecting it to be a money loser with little growth. Instead, we got a highly profitable quarter with a modest growth. And that's why the stock\u2019s soared 42%.\u201d\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) operates a dynamic platform that fosters the creation and engagement of digital communities centered around diverse interests, allowing users to participate in discussions and share various types of content. The company reported its Q3 results on October 29 and the stock has been up over 38% since then, as of November 1.\nThe company exceeded Wall Street expectations by reporting earnings that showed substantial growth. It achieved revenue of $348 million, which showed a remarkable year-over-year increase of 68%. This performance resulted in a positive earnings per diluted share of $0.16, a significant turnaround from a previous net loss of $0.13. User engagement on Reddit has also seen considerable growth, with active user counts increasing by 51% in the U.S. and 44% in international markets.\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) management attributed this surge in part to advancements in machine translation, which has led to four times the incremental growth in daily users. The company plans to extend this technology to additional countries, which is expected to further drive user engagement. Additionally, the average revenue per user (ARPU) grew by 14% globally, contributing to a 56% boost in worldwide advertising sales, which remains the primary driver of the company's growth.\nIn a notable development, the company's smaller revenue category, labeled \"other revenue,\" experienced a dramatic increase of 547%, primarily fueled by the expansion of its artificial intelligence business. This segment includes data licensing partnerships that have become increasingly significant. During the earnings call, COO Jen Wong highlighted that the company licenses its user data to facilitate advertising analytics and to assist in training large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems.\n5. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 100\nOn Wednesday, talking about his favorite, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Cramer expressed disappointment with the company\u2019s recent earnings report. Here\u2019s what Mad Money\u2019s host had to say:\n\u201cThen there's Cramer fave, Eli Lilly. Here's the stock that's been almost as hot as Nvidia. It's up 45% for the year, even after today's hideous 6.2% collapse. Given how much Lilly had run into the quarter, we needed to see some extraordinary numbers from the revolutionary GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss, right?... And we also needed them to raise their forecast dramatically, but we got nothing like that. Instead, Lily reported a clear miss, a real whiff. And the explanation for it was totally opaque. I'm still trying to figure out what the heck happened. Was it too much supply? Too little demand? Stock finished about $56. One point, it was down a hundred. Talk about an unhappy forecast.\u201d\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is a prominent global pharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming diabetes care and addressing obesity and its serious long-term effects. A shining star in its product line is Zepbound, a new treatment for obesity that activates specific hormone receptors, offering a fresh approach in this therapeutic area. Another significant product is Mounjaro, the first approved medication for type 2 diabetes targeting these same receptors, utilizing tirzepatide as its active ingredient. These medications, also known as GLP-1 agonists, function by activating receptors for hormones released after eating, helping individuals feel fuller.\nIn the third quarter, the company reported sales of $11.44 billion. The company noted that U.S. sales for both Mounjaro and Zepbound were adversely affected by a decrease in inventories within the wholesaler channel.\nDuring the Q3 earnings call, CFO Lucas Montarce explained that wholesalers had reduced their inventories of diabetes and obesity drugs during the quarter, describing it as a temporary issue. He emphasized that demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound remains strong and continues to grow. CEO David Ricks also highlighted a 25% increase in U.S. prescription volume for these medications from the second to the third quarter.\nFor 2024, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) anticipates a non-GAAP EPS between $13.02 and $13.52, having previously forecast a full-year non-GAAP EPS of $16.10 to $16.60. This adjustment is primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic Holdings, which impacted in-process research and development charges by $3.09 billion, or $3.33 per share. For the third quarter, these charges amounted to $2.83 billion, or $3.08 per share, mainly associated with the Morphic Holdings acquisition.\n4. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\nCramer remarked that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) performed well enough in its third quarter but not exceptionally well while highlighting the company\u2019s difficulties with supply chain constraints.\n\u201cNow, we're trying to buy it for my Charitable Trust. Last night, AMD reported an extraordinary quarter, numbers I could never have imagined a year ago, two years ago. Back then, I would've thought that making $2 billion in artificial intelligence chips would be incredible and now it looks like they\u2019ll do $5 billion. But traders don't care about the quarter, that's now in the rearview mirror. Do they? They care about the next quarter and the next 12 months for that matter. And on that basis, AMD did well, but not well enough.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a prominent player in the semiconductor sector, recognized for its innovative processors and graphics solutions that cater to a wide range of applications, including personal computers and data centers. Competing with major companies like Intel and Nvidia, it operates through key business segments such as Client, Data Center, Gaming, and Embedded, with a strong emphasis on high-performance and adaptive computing technologies.\nIt should be noted that during the earnings call, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su discussed the ongoing challenges in the supply chain environment, commenting that the company has effectively managed its capacity. She acknowledged that while supply tightness is expected to persist in the upcoming quarters, the company has outlined plans for significant growth heading into 2025.\nFor the fourth quarter, the company expects revenue to be around $7.5 billion, with a possible variance of $300 million, indicating a projected growth of 22% at the midpoint.\nAdditionally, the company has revised its full-year GPU data center revenue forecast from over $4.5 billion to now exceeding $5 billion. Looking toward 2025, the company remains optimistic about continued growth in the data center segment, driven by substantial investments from companies aiming to expand their infrastructure for AI workloads. The company also mentioned that customers are increasingly diversifying the workloads they run on its GPUs.\n3. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nDuring last Wednesday's Mad Money episode, Cramer acknowledged that he did not have many expectations from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) previously but highlighted that its recent quarterly earnings report reminded him of the \u201cold Google\u201d.\n\u201cAlphabet defines the happy beat and raise. This stock had been the laggard in the Mag 7. Nobody expected much from it at all, I didn't. I mean we own it for the trust, but I didn't. The company has a really bad habit of giving you a muddled message even when it's doing well.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) provides a wide range of products and services through its segments, including advertising, cloud services, communication tools, and various platforms like YouTube and Google Play, catering to both consumer and enterprise needs. As per Statcounter Global Stats, Google Search holds the primary position among search engines as its market share is 89.33%.\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud achieved significant revenue growth of 35%, reaching $11.4 billion. The company noted that customers are increasingly adopting its AI platform for building and customizing models, with the Gemini model gaining notable popularity. Management highlighted the success of its data platform BigQuery, alongside AI-driven cybersecurity solutions like Google Threat Intelligence and Security Operations, which have expanded the company's application portfolio.\nIn addition to cloud services, Google Search has also shown strong performance, with revenue rising over 12% to more than $49 billion. The company noted particular strength among financial services providers, including insurance companies, and retailers. AI capabilities are helping the company gain deeper insights into user behavior, allowing for better connections between users and advertisers.\nMeanwhile, YouTube has achieved significant milestones, with total ad and subscription revenues exceeding $50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time, driven by offerings such as YouTube TV, NFL Sunday Ticket, and YouTube Music Premium.\n2. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nCramer delved into Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) third-quarter earnings report that was released on October 30. Here\u2019s what he had to say about it:\n\u201cMeta stock instantly plunged about 20 bucks when it reported because there was no beat and raise lingo. Remember we like that stuff spoon-fed because we're lazy. I had to bat this one around for a while with the crew because there are puts and takes to the guidance. That's another technical term, puts and takes\u2026 And I still can't be sure that it should be down so much. It's coining money for heaven's sake. Again, hard to pin down. A non-beaten, non raiser that made the numbers.\u201d\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a global leader in connecting people through a variety of products that allow for sharing and interaction on mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables. The company boasts an audience of 3.29 billion daily active users across its platforms. The majority of its revenue comes from selling advertising space to businesses looking to reach this extensive audience. As users engage more with platforms like Facebook and Instagram, the number of advertisements they encounter increases, driving revenue growth.\nIn Q3, Meta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) advertising revenue climbed nearly 19%, totaling $39.9 billion. The company has projected its fourth-quarter revenue between $45 billion and $48 billion. Additionally, a notable rise in capital expenditures is expected in 2025, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of investing in artificial intelligence and infrastructure for future growth.\nManagement mentioned that AI plays a crucial role in boosting user engagement and time spent on its platforms, while also providing tools for advertisers to improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and boost conversion rates. The company highlighted advancements in its Llama large language model, which has seen significant growth in tokens, aiding in AI computations. Training for Llama 4 is currently underway, utilizing a cluster that is bigger than 100,000 H100 graphic processing units.\n1. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nTalking about Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) solid quarter during last Wednesday\u2019s episode, Cramer highlighted the company surpassing the estimates and advised to focus on the forward guidance.\n\u201cMicrosoft traded up initially on the strength of the results for the reporting quarter, including a top and bottom line beat, plus, much better than expected growth for its Azure cloud computing business. It grew 33%, Wall Street's looking for 29 and 12 points of that growth came from the company's AI offerings. That said, anyone trading Microsoft now's being reckless. As I told you, many times, many times the success of each Microsoft quarter is usually determined by the company's forward guidance, which they don't give us until\u2026 the conference call that's going on right now.\u201d\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading technology company that develops and supports a wide range of software, services, devices, and solutions. Its portfolio includes productivity applications, business solutions, cloud services, operating systems, hardware, and gaming products.\nAccording to IBISWorld, the company has a noteworthy market share in around 18 industries. It holds the largest market share in the Database, Storage, and Backup Software Publishing industry, representing approximately 56.0% of the total revenue in this sector.\nFor fiscal Q2 2025, the company\u2019s management expects growth for its Azure cloud services to range between 31% and 32%, marking a deceleration from the previous quarter's 34% growth rate. Overall, revenue for the Intelligent Cloud segment is projected to increase by 18% to 20% year over year.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) management projected that sales from AI-related products are expected to remain consistent with last quarter's performance. The company is optimistic about Azure's potential to accelerate in the latter half of the fiscal year, driven by new investments in data center capacity that are set to come online.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure.

          "whole_article": "Constellation Energy stock (CEG) fell 12.5% Monday amid a broader decline in nuclear power stocks following the US government's rejection of another Big Tech nuclear power agreement late Friday.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a proposal from a grid operator, PJM, to ramp up the amount of power supplied through the grid from Talen Energy (TLN) to an Amazon (AMZN) artificial intelligence data center. Talen said in a statement on Sunday it believes the FERC \"erred\" in its ruling, adding the company is \"evaluating our options, with a focus on commercial solutions.\"\nTalen Energy dropped 2.2%, while Sam Altman-backed Oklo (OKLO) fell 2.8%, Centrus Energy (LEU) tumbled 28.8%, NANO Nuclear (NNE) dropped 12.8%, Vistra (VST) sank 3.2%, and NuScale Power (SMR) fell 2.8%.\nEven with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\u2022 USD\n(CEG)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nBig Tech\u2019s interest in nuclear energy has risen substantially as companies look to meet growing demand from power-hungry data centers to run generative artificial intelligence software without falling behind on their climate goals. Amazon, Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power.\nConstellation entered into a 20-year deal with Microsoft in late September to supply power to one of its AI data centers. The stock is up 36% from three months ago, as the Microsoft deal and Big Tech\u2019s growing interest in nuclear power have sent shares soaring.\nThree Mile Island nuclear power plant stands in the middle of the Susquehanna River on Oct. 10, 2024, near Middletown, Pennsylvania. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) \u00b7 Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images\nConstellation Energy also on Monday reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.74, ahead of Wall Street\u2019s forecast of $2.65, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Its quarterly revenue of $6.6 billion also surpassed the $5.2 billion expected by analysts.\n\u201cThe importance of AI and the data economy to America\u2019s economic competitiveness and national security can\u2019t be overstated, and Constellation will do our part to meet the moment,\u201d Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez said in a statement Monday.\nStill, red tape plagues the industry. Nuclear projects have been subject to stringent regulations in response to high-profile global nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011.\nOn average, it takes the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission 80 months to approve nuclear plant construction in the US, according to research cited by Canaccord Genuity.\nThe FERC said in its filing Friday that it rejected the Amazon nuclear power agreement due in part to concerns that it could threaten the reliability of the power grid and raise energy costs for the public.\nStory Continues\nConstellation\u2019s deal with Microsoft, which would restart Three Mile Island for the first time following the meltdown, still requires approval from the NRC.\nBipartisan support, however, has mounted to reduce regulatory hurdles.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 4, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.\nMicrosoft, Amazon or Alphabet: Who's Winning the Cloud Race?\nAs cloud computing transforms the digital landscape, industry giants Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet dominate the race with their respective cloud platforms\u2014Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. Each company has invested heavily in AI, data storage, and innovative technologies to attract business clients and capture greater market share. Today, Amazon leads the group in cloud market share with 31% of the market, then Microsoft with 20% followed by Alphabet with 12%.\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, in the third quarter of 2024, spending on global cloud infrastructure services surged by $15.7 billion, or 23%, over the same period in 2023, reaching over $84 billion for the quarter ending September 30. Over the last year, revenue from cloud infrastructure services hit $313 billion, underscoring the intense competition in this sector. Despite its massive scale, the cloud market continues to expand rapidly, with year-over-year (YoY) growth accelerating for the fourth straight quarter.\nAll three of these stocks reported earnings this week, with the results of their cloud services segments under the microscope. Amazon and Alphabet had positive reactions to their earnings results, while Microsoft saw some selling following its meeting. All companies had very positive results though, beating sales and earnings estimates. Also notable, Amazon stock has outperformed the market year-to-date (YTD), while Alphabet is about in line with market performance and Microsoft below.\nAMZN, GOOGL and MSFT Earnings Revisions\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have each made significant strides in cloud computing, but their earnings revision trends and growth forecasts tell slightly different stories. Both Amazon and Microsoft currently hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a relatively flat earnings revision trend. On the other hand, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting a more favorable outlook driven by recent upward revisions to its earnings estimates.\nLooking at long-term earnings growth projections, Amazon stands out with an anticipated annual growth rate of 27.2% over the next three to five years led by AWS. Alphabet's expected growth rate of 17.6% per year reflects its continued growth in cloud services, YouTube and now self-driving with Waymo, while Microsoft, expected to grow at 14.7% annually, showcases steady gains in both its cloud and software offerings, including Azure and Office 365.\nStory Continues\nTheir valuation also offers valuable insight into what investors can expect going forward. Today, Alphabet is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.4x which is below its 10-year median of 25.8x, Amazon at 38.4x is also below its 10-year median of 92.4x and Microsoft at 31.2x is above its 10-year median of 26.5x.\nAMZN, GOOGL or MSFT: Which Shares Should Investors Buy?\nFor investors seeking the best mix of growth potential and value, GOOGL and AMZN stand out as the most attractive choices among the cloud giants. Both companies not only boast strong earnings growth projections\u2014with Amazon leading the group\u2014but also offer relatively appealing valuations compared to Microsoft discounting for growth forecasts and historical valuations.\nAlphabet's recent performance in the cloud segment and ongoing investments in AI and self-driving cars show huge promise, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio remains appealing given its growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Amazon's growth prospects are bolstered by its dominant position in e-commerce and the ever-expanding AWS, which remains a leader in the cloud infrastructure market. Additionally, Amazon's valuation is more favorable relative to its growth rate and historical average, making it an attractive option for those focused on long-term potential.\nIn contrast, Microsoft's substantial capital expenditures on AI and other tech advancements\u2014though expected to drive future growth\u2014have been flagged as a point of concern for now. While Microsoft remains a cloud and AI powerhouse, these elevated costs could temper near-term returns, making it comparatively less compelling at current valuations.\nOverall, Alphabet and Amazon's mix of robust growth forecasts and favorable valuations make them top picks in the cloud landscape for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 4, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\nBreaking Down Mag 7 Earnings Results\nOf the six members of 'The Magnificent 7' group of stocks that have reported September-quarter results already, the market didn't like three \u2013 Apple, Microsoft and Meta \u2013 but loved the Teslareport and liked what it saw from Alphabet and Amazon.\nThe group ceded its market leadership role a few months back, and these mixed results can be interpreted to mean that the trend is now here to stay. In other words, the group's unambiguous market leadership of last year and early this year is now firmly behind us.\nI want to push back on part of this narrative, as most Mag 7 stocks provide some of the most sustainable growth performances in the entire market.\nAside from Apple, which is likely no longer a growth company, the other Mag 7 companies are not only generating impressive top- and bottom-line growth today, but the trend is expected to remain in place at least through next year, if not beyond.\nTake the case of Apple, which beat consensus estimates and whose Q3 earnings increased +8.8% from the year-earlier level to almost $25 billion on +6.1% higher revenues of nearly $95 billion. Apple may no longer command the growth pace of its peers like Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta, but it enjoys a degree of market dominance that is hard to dislodge by its competitors, let alone start-ups.\nMicrosoft's Q3 earnings were up +10.7% on +16% higher revenues, while Meta's earnings increased +35.4% on +18.9% revenue growth. Both companies beat top- and bottom-line consensus estimates.\nIf one was nitpicking the results from these two companies, then signs of deceleration in Microsoft's cloud revenues and Meta's advertising revenues would be the only operating issues here. Is that the issue in the Microsoft and Meta reports, or is there something else at play?\nThe answer to that question lies in what Microsoft and Meta are doing to prepare for the artificial intelligence (AI) world. Each of them is heavily investing in building AI infrastructure, and the amounts involved are massive and bigger than many in the markets had been expecting.\nIn fact, Microsoft and Meta are hardly alone in this boat, as Alphabet and Amazon are spending as heavily on AI infrastructure as these two.\nIn fact, Apple is the lone laggard in this regard, though it has started talking more about the AI capabilities embedded in its coming software upgrades that will require users to have the newest iPhones. However, we should remember that unlike Apple, which is solely a consumer-facing operator whose AI functionalities will be targeted at consumers, the other Mag 7 players primarily target businesses with their AI offerings.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet and Amazon have been able to explain and show the impact and contribution of AI spending level on its current and coming growth trajectory this earnings season. Microsoft and Meta didn't do a good job on that front.\nWe have no reason to think that these otherwise very well-run companies are throwing good money on questionable projects. As such, we like these companies investing in their future that will ensure their primacy and leadership status in the AI-centric future world. In other words, we think the market's capex fixation is overdone.\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q3 earnings for the Technology sector are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +11.4% higher revenues. Please note that had it not been for the big hit that Intel took in Q3, earnings growth for the sector would be +30.5%.\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks in the forefront of the rising estimates trend.\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nThrough Friday, November 1st, we have seen Q3 results from 350 S&P 500 members, or 70% of the index's total membership. With 104 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week, we will have seen Q3 results from more than 90% of the index's membership.\nTotal earnings for these 350 companies that have reported are up +8.8% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues, with 74.9% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 60.6% beating revenue estimates.\nThe proportion of these 350 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 50.3%.\nAs you can see above, the growth trend appears to be stable and positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter average for this group of companies, with the Q3 revenue beats percentage just a hair above the low point for the preceding 20-quarter period.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +6.8% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\nThe Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.\nHad it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +9.2% instead of +6.8%. Excluding the Tech sector's substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be only +2% instead of +6.8%.\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +1.3% instead of +6.8%.\nFor the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues.\nUnlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better.\nPlease note that this year's +7.5% earnings growth improves to +9.5% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Tech Flexes Earnings Power: A Closer Look\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nView our latest analysis for Microsoft\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Microsoft\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President & Vice Chairman, Bradford Smith, sold US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$412 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$410. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).\nInsiders in Microsoft didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\ninsider-trading-volume\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nMicrosoft Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Microsoft shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$46m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nInsider Ownership Of Microsoft\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Microsoft insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$998m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nSo What Do The Microsoft Insider Transactions Indicate?\nInsiders sold Microsoft shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Microsoft is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Microsoft. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Microsoft and we suggest you have a look.\nStory Continues\nOf course Microsoft may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Cloud Security earns perfect scores in API Security, Automation, Threat Hunting, Scalability, Cost, and Compliance\nAUSTIN, Texas, November 04, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) today announced it has been named a Leader in the 2024 GigaOm Radar Report for Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs). The report recognizes CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Cloud Security\u2019s innovation and performance, earning perfect 5/5 scores in critical functionality areas including API Security, Security Automation and Orchestration, Threat Hunting and Anomaly Detection, Scalability, Cost, and Compliance.\nAccording to the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report, cloud exploitation cases surged by 110% over the past year, with adversaries becoming increasingly focused and persistent. Stopping cloud breaches requires a modern CNAPP that delivers comprehensive visibility and protection across every attack path. CrowdStrike is the only platform that protects the entire modern cloud estate\u2014infrastructure, applications, data and AI models\u2014from a single, unified platform, so organizations can easily consolidate point products, reduce complexity and stop cloud breaches.\nCrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Security is differentiated from point cloud security tools in the market in the following areas:\nConsolidated Code to Cloud Protection: With unified visibility and protection in a single-agent and agentless platform architecture, CrowdStrike eliminates security gaps and stops cloud breaches without making customers manage different cloud security point products. Customers can consolidate the disjointed point products across their entire cloud estate to reduce overall costs and eliminate complexity.\nBuilt to Stop Breaches: Many CNAPPs are thinly veiled CSPMs, built as cloud vulnerability management tools lacking capabilities to stop cloud breaches. CrowdStrike stops threats in real-time with advanced runtime protection delivered from the same unified agent as CrowdStrike\u2019s best-in-class EDR and Identity Protection. Leveraging world-class managed threat hunting and intelligence, CrowdStrike sets the standard for cloud detection and response (CDR) as a native part of the most comprehensive cloud security platform, built to stop the breach.\nComplete Hybrid Cloud Security: With most organizations operating a hybrid architecture, CrowdStrike provides unified protection across cloud and on-prem environments through a single sensor. This ensures full visibility and security coverage, including cloud-native technologies like ASPM, which work seamlessly across both cloud and on-prem applications. CrowdStrike stops attackers as they move between environments, eliminating gaps and simplifying hybrid cloud security.\nStory Continues\n\"Cloud security is at a critical inflection point\u2014adversaries are more relentless than ever, leveraging stolen identity credentials to exploit cloud environments as a preferred attack vector. Traditional approaches and point cloud security tools are not sufficient to provide the visibility and protection needed to stop cloud breaches,\" said Raj Rajamani, head of products, CrowdStrike. \"At CrowdStrike, we are redefining what\u2019s possible in cloud security. Being recognized as a Leader by GigaOm underscores our relentless innovation and leadership in the market. Falcon Cloud Security goes beyond visibility\u2014it provides automated intelligence, threat hunting, protection and scalability, empowering organizations to not only detect cloud issues but also stop breaches in real time, outpace adversaries, and confidently secure their cloud environments for the future.\"\nAccording to Chris Ray, Principal Analyst at GigaOm: \"Falcon Cloud Security received a 5/5 in several areas, most notably in API security. This high score is attributed to its ability to positively identify APIs used by applications in client clouds, as well as analyze upstream and downstream communication among applications and services to understand risks.\" He added: \"The solution also stands out in scalability, leveraging a cloud-native architecture claimed to handle trillions of events per day while also supporting smaller deployments of less than 100 assets\u2026The solution\u2019s comprehensive approach makes [Falcon Cloud Security] valuable for securing cloud-native applications, managing cloud misconfigurations, and protecting against advanced threats in cloud environments.\"\nFor more information on the GigaOm Radar Report for Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs), please visit our website.\nAbout CrowdStrike\nCrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, has redefined modern security with the world\u2019s most advanced cloud-native platform for protecting critical areas of enterprise risk \u2013 endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data.\nPowered by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud and world-class AI, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform leverages real-time indicators of attack, threat intelligence, evolving adversary tradecraft and enriched telemetry from across the enterprise to deliver hyper-accurate detections, automated protection and remediation, elite threat hunting and prioritized observability of vulnerabilities.\nPurpose-built in the cloud with a single lightweight-agent architecture, the Falcon platform delivers rapid and scalable deployment, superior protection and performance, reduced complexity and immediate time-to-value.\nCrowdStrike: We stop breaches.\nLearn more: https://www.crowdstrike.com/\nFollow us: Blog | Twitter | LinkedIn | Facebook | Instagram\nStart a free trial today: https://www.crowdstrike.com/free-trial-guide/\n\u00a9 2024 CrowdStrike, Inc.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in CrowdStrike Holdings implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\nInsiders have been selling lately\nEvery investor in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CrowdStrike Holdings.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CrowdStrike Holdings?\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nWe can see that CrowdStrike Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of CrowdStrike Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in CrowdStrike Holdings. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.6%. With 7.5% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO George Kurtz is the owner of 3.1% of the company's shares.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nStory Continues\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.. Insiders own US$3.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over CrowdStrike Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with CrowdStrike Holdings .\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

He added that a lot of time and effort would be freed up when there is a set of regulator-approved control standards for the industry.\nYue said banks are required to conduct risk assessments of AI service providers to strengthen their operational resilience and must have in place contingency plans to address potential service disruptions caused by third parties.\nStory Continues\nThese \"basic, common sense\" moves are essential to better safeguard companies and other institutions, said James Elwes, HSBC's chief information officer for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"[Third-party risk management] starts with simply identifying where your concentration risk is and documenting that,\" he said. \"If you've not done that, you're not going to do any of the next steps that are important.\"\nVendor diversification could help to solve some issues, Elwes said, but he added that big tech companies are often the most well-equipped to be third-party service providers.\n\"There are benefits to concentration simply because of the nature of some of these organisations - the scale they can provide and the investment they can put in,\" he said.\n\"So a degree of concentration on vendors, especially within technology, is likely to remain.\"\nSarah Breeden, deputy governor at the Bank of England, said in a pre-recorded speech that financial institutions are expected to have a \"stronger and more rigorous\" grasp of AI as they increase their dependence on it for \"higher impact areas of their businesses.\" These areas include credit risk assessment, capital management and algorithmic trading.\nHong Kong's government unveiled its first guidelines on the responsible use of AI on Monday. They said any financial institution that wants to use AI must have a strategy on how the systems should be implemented and used, as well as offer advisory and training services for on-premise deployment.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks on the list of crowded software short positions.\nWith the close of 2024 approaching fast, artificial intelligence continues to set the narrative on Wall Street. The tail end of October marks the start of another highly anticipated earnings season, which for the most part, will continue to be dominated by AI. On the hardware front, investors will be on the lookout for whether the demand for AI GPUs is sustaining and if the firm that is the market leader is also improving its margins and profitability. For software stocks, investors will pour over profitability data to determine whether the billions of dollars invested in training and testing AI as well as in business partnerships are yielding results.\nFor software stocks, their exposure to AI is so strong that it has divided the 2024 stock performance of some firms into neat halves determined by investor sentiment about their AI products. One such AI software stock ranked 5th on our recent list of AI stocks that insiders are selling. Looking at its year-to-date share price performance, it\u2019s rather neatly divided into two halves that converge on June 13th. Year to date on June 13th, the shares were down 19.8% even though the firm\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenue was a cool $19.4 billion and had grown by 10% annually. Before that eventful day, the firm\u2019s first quarter had seen it grow revenue by 11% annually but struggle to keep costs low and profit margins high.\nYet, the investor bearishness surrounding this well-known provider of productivity software tools such as Photoshop and Reader, would change in the blink of an eye. From June 13th to the third week of October, the shares have reversed course and gained 8.5%. In fact, between the 13th and September 12th, the stock had gained 27.9%. June 13th was the day that this firm reported its second-quarter earnings. The results led to its shares jumping by 13% in aftermarket trading, with investors impressed by the fact that the firm increased full-year guidance to range between $21.40 billion and $21.50 billion from an earlier $21.30 billion $21.50 billion.\nThe optimism was driven in part by the firm\u2019s Creative Cloud business which includes products such as Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, and Express. The AI addition to Creative Cloud was the firm\u2019s set of generative AI models dubbed Firefly. Management shared that Firefly was at the heart of the ARR guidance bump to $1.95 billion as they shared:\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the Digital Media business and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services and Express. We\u2019re pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half.\u201d\nWith AI profitability driving the second-quarter earnings season, investors were naturally ecstatic and sent the stock higher.\nHowever, the June respite would be short-lived as the shares tanked by 13.4% in September. As usual, AI was the culprit. The downward trend started in the form of a 9.2% drop in after-market following the firm\u2019s third-quarter report. It saw the company guide Q4 revenue at a midpoint of $5.525 billion which fell below the $5.61 billion analyst consensus.\nWhile this firm is a consumer and professional software stock, the broader software as a service (SaaS) industry hasn\u2019t been spared by the AI-driven Wall Street trends either. SaaS and software stocks are predominantly valued through two metrics: the Rule of 40 and EV/Sales (or variants such as EV/EBITDA or Price to Sales). These multiples are somewhat unique to the software and SaaS stock narrative as they evaluate the firms based on their ability to grow. This is key since one of the main reasons behind SaaS stock popularity is that they do not have to deal with inventory, logistics, or supply chain issues like other businesses.\nIn the AI era, SaaS valuation multiples and revenue growth estimates have been severely compressed. Data shows that the median price to forward sales SaaS multiple is 5.5x right now. The valuations are driven by lower growth expectations. After AI and the decimation ushered in by high interest rates, just 1% of SaaS and software companies have a 12-month future revenue growth rate higher than 30% as of June 2024. Digging deeper, investors have also placed a higher premium on growth as while firms with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 have a median EV/Sales multiple of 8.9x, those with a growth rate greater than 30% but a Rule of 40 score lesser than 40 have a median multiple of 11.6x.\nThese AI-driven software shifts, precipitated by worries of a reduction in SaaS demand due to businesses self-developing software using AI have also affected investor sentiment. According to Jefferies\u2019 latest Trading Positioning Survey, 19% of institutional investors were overweight on software stocks as of October 2024, a sharp drop over July\u2019s reading of 28% and January\u2019s 51%. Yet, investors have also tempered their short positions as Jefferies shows that 54 software stocks were shorted as of October compared to 73 in July.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software short positions, we ranked the top nine crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a well-known cybersecurity software provider that rose to fame earlier this year after its faulty software update led to an unbelievable 8.5 million computers going offline worldwide. The outage also flipped the firm\u2019s narrative, as the shares lost more than 42% of their value over the next two weeks. However, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has managed to control some of the damage from the outage as its shares are up 24.9% year to date and 41.6% since the post-outage bottom. Part of the recovery is based on easing investor worries of customer loss as CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) might be able to prevent fallout due to high switching costs. Investors will nevertheless be on the watchout for customers jumping ship, and they will also monitor CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s fiscal 2031 recurring revenue guidance of $10 billion and midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of crowded software shorts according to Jefferies. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $982.26 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25%. The $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +27.5% and +22.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(CRWD) Rebounds Amid Post-Outage Challenges\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity software products provider that made headlines earlier this year due to a faulty software update that caused one of the biggest software outages in history. The outage affected an unbelievable 8.5 million computers worldwide, and it is now shaping CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s narrative as well. While the shares are up by 42% since the post-outage bottom, compared to the pre-outage peak, they are still down 20.8%. Investors are waiting to see whether the reputational impacts from the outage might lead businesses to not renew their contracts with CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s Falcon system. As for the firm, it is still targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by its fiscal year 2031 and a midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%. Consequently, investors will be combing CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s upcoming earnings with a fine-toothed comb to see if customer sentiment has weakened to make meeting these guidelines difficult.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 9th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Delta did not immediately comment on CrowdStrike's suit.\nCrowdStrike is seeking a declaratory judgment plus legal fees.\nDelta's lawsuit filed on Friday in Fulton County Superior Court called the faulty software update from CrowdStrike \"catastrophic\" and said the company \"forced untested and faulty updates to its customers, causing more than 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to crash.\"\nDelta said the faulty update caused 7,000 flight cancellations, disrupted travel plans of 1.3 million customers and cost the carrier more than $500 million.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit, also filed on Friday, said Delta's own response and technology caused delays in the carrier's ability to resume normal operations.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit reiterated its contention that it has minimal liability, something Delta rejected.\nDelta said CrowdStrike is liable for over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses as well as for unspecified lost profits, expenditures - including legal fees - reputational harm and future revenue loss.\nThe incident prompted the U.S. Transportation Department to open an investigation.\n\"If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed,\" Delta's lawsuit says.\nDelta said it has invested billions of dollars in information technology licensing and infrastructure.\nLast month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologized before Congress for the faulty software update.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Broadcom Inc. (AVGO).\nBroadcom Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.18, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.18 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 30 are Strong Buy, representing 90.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AVGO\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for AVGO\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Broadcom Inc. here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Broadcom Inc., it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs AVGO Worth Investing In?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Broadcom Inc., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $4.82.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in November.\nAmid soaring valuations of AI stocks, beginner investors keep wondering whether they are too late to the AI party. However, investing experts believe that opportunities abound in the AI space because of the nature of this technological revolution.\nWhile talking to Wall Street Journal during the\u00a0WSJ Tech Live Conference, venture capitalist Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, explained why he believes there is no such thing as \u201ctoo late\u201d when it comes to AI for now.\n\u201cWhen it comes to AI, it really feels like the marginal cost of language, reasoning and creation are going to zero. And if that\u2019s the case, this is a supercycle. And if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ve got decades. So there\u2019s no \u201ctoo late.\u201d In that sense, we\u2019re still very, very early.\u201d\nThe AI revolution is quickly entering the phase where we are seeing real-life use cases as AI is helping companies significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency. According to a detailed report published by Benesch\u2019s AI Commission, an AI-based tool that monitors real-time data from electronic medical records reduced unexpected deaths in hospitalized internal medicine patients by 26%.\nCasado also talked about the usability of AI models for actual problem-solving:\n\u201cEverybody looks at the OpenAIs. But as far as value creation and integration, if you look at all the private companies, the smaller companies that are building their own smaller models, they are some of the fastest-growing companies we\u2019ve seen in the history of the industry.\u201d\nAlso Read\u00a010 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\u00a0and\u00a010 Best Mid-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now.\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and earnings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nibm, pc, testing, closeup, isolated, human, technician, mainboard, technical, white, tool, hardware, power, business, engineering, repairman, processor, install, occupation,\nSergiy Zavgorodny/Shutterstock.com\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nBill Baruch, President, Blue Line Futures, recently said while talking during a program on CNBC:\nStory Continues\n\u201cIt\u2019s breaking out. The stock looks terrific. If you look outside of Nvidia, it\u2019s been the best performing. It\u2019s the diversification they have as well with the subscription business and the infrastructure building within that space. I think this name is going to continue to rise. We hold it not only in our main portfolio but in our concentrated portfolio.\u201d\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nBroadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. The company expects about $12 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2024, which means 20% of its total revenue will come from AI and counting.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in November. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nBroadcom Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Hock Tan, for US$26m worth of shares, at about US$173 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$169. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).\nBroadcom insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\ninsider-trading-volume\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nBroadcom Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Broadcom. Specifically, insiders ditched US$60m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of Broadcom\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Broadcom insiders own 1.3% of the company, worth about US$10b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Broadcom Tell Us?\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Broadcom. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.\nStory Continues\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other S&P 500 stocks.\nAs per AXA Investment Managers, the US dominated financial markets this year. The investment firm believes that the broader economy has been stronger than anticipated with GDP growth running at an annualized rate of 3.0% in Q2. The blue-chip benchmark, S&P 500 index, has surged ~22% on a YTD basis. Also, the US fixed-income markets saw strong returns. Overall, the financial markets were supported by the success of the US Fed in dealing with inflation.\nInterest rates have started to move lower, with credit markets reflecting the strength of the broader US corporate sector, per AXA Investment Managers. At the start of October 2024, the investment firm mentioned that a 50:50 allocation to the S&P 500 Growth equity index and the ICE US High Yield bond index might have resulted in a return of ~18% YTD.\nS&P 500 Index \u2013 The Road Ahead\nForbes believes that the prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. While the momentum in technology innovation, together with the environment of lower interest rates, should help the broader S&P 500 index, investors are required to be wary of certain risks. These include elevated valuations, global tensions, and uncertainty regarding the US presidential election.\nAccording to ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, which is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor (RIA), the ongoing innovation in AI and lower rates should help the\u00a0S&P 500 Index see growth in the range of 14.5% \u2013 19.6%. Another firm, Running Point Capital Advisors, expects the S&P 500 to see an increase of 7% \u2013 11% in 2025, with some volatility. As per the company, the influencing factors include economic growth, expansion in earnings, higher mergers and acquisitions activity, and a\u00a0favorable interest rate environment.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\nSectors To Keep on Radar\nForbes highlighted that investors are required to keep certain sectors, like technology, healthcare, and energy, on the\u00a0radar in 2025. As per IDC, worldwide spending on AI, which includes AI-enabled applications, infrastructure, and associated IT and business services, should more than double by 2028 to reach $632 billion. The incorporation of AI, and generative AI (GenAI) in particular, in a range of products should result in a\u00a0CAGR of ~29.0% over 2024-2028, which should help the broader technology sector.\nStory Continues\nDefinitive Healthcare believes that investors should see more device makers and pharmaceutical companies jump on the D2C bandwagon in 2025. Also, ICRA, a Credit Rating Agency, expects a strong financial outlook for the broader hospital industry in FY 2025. The optimistic outlook stems from the increasing incidence of non-communicable lifestyle diseases, a rise in per capita healthcare spending, increased medical tourism, and penetration of health insurance.\nUS Energy Information Administration, in its short-term energy outlook report (October 2024), mentioned that the summer temperatures this year were warmer in the US as compared to last summer, mainly in the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which supported pushing up the US electricity demand. EIA expects 2% more U.S. sales of electricity to ultimate customers in 2024 as compared to 2023, followed by another 2% expected growth in 2025. Overall, it expects electricity sales to increase throughout economic sectors. It projects that commercial electricity sales will rise by 3% this year followed by a 1% growth in 2025.\nBroadcom Inc.

After getting the list, stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds were chosen. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holdings: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.\nWall Street analysts opine that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s long-term growth trajectory is expected to be aided by its competitive advantages, which stem from\u00a0intangible assets in chip design and switching costs for the software products. The company plans to continue its focus on hyperscalers, cloud, and digital natives for AI products. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) anticipates a recovery in non-AI markets and robust AI revenue growth in fiscal 2025.\nIts strategic financial management, which includes debt restructuring and dividend payouts, demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a\u00a0healthy balance sheet while, at the same time, delivering value to shareholders. Its focus on AI and collaboration with Seagate reflect its emphasis on innovation and market trends. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been positioning itself for strong growth in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.\nThe company is a critical player in the AI revolution, leveraging expertise in custom silicon and networking solutions in a bid to tap a\u00a0substantial share of the expanding market.

As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

          "whole_article": "Another kitchen sink type of earnings day from chip giant Intel (INTC).\nIntel stock (INTC) rose slightly in premarket trading on Friday as the struggling US icon managed to serve up better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Shares had been up about 8% late Thursday, but a cautious earnings call subdued sentiment.\n\"This was a critical quarter for us, and I think [it] gives optimism for what is to come,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance moments after the company's earnings call ended (video above).\n\u2022 USD\n(INTC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe somewhat positive market reaction may be a tad overdone when digging into the quarterly results.\nIntel revealed $15.9 billion in total non-cash charges related to inventory write-downs and lower performance expectations for certain businesses, such as autonomous driving firm Mobileye (MBLY), where it owns a majority stake. The company reported a $5.8 billion operating loss at Intel Foundry \u2014 Intel's upstart chipmaking business \u2014 on $4.4 billion in sales.\nIntel took a cautious stance on the health of the foundry business and its artificial intelligence product roadmap in 2025.\n\"The bad news, in our view, is that Intel's AI strategy appears to have changed again, now with what seems to be a longer-term approach that centers on the traditional CPU+co-processor/accelerator approach to Enterprise class AI workloads,\" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note on Friday.\nOn the earnings call, management promised to continue executing a $10 billion cost-cutting plan and exploring alternative sources of funding to support chipmaking ambitions.\nGelsinger told Yahoo Finance that no deal is imminent in terms of external funding.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger holds a sample of a wafer during his keynote speech at Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images\nHe reiterated that Intel will push forward with opening chipmaking plants in states like Ohio and Arizona despite not receiving billions of dollars in funding yet from the CHIPS Act.\nThe Biden administration has earmarked $8.5 billion in direct funding to Intel for its projects, but the company is still awaiting the cash as government officials iron out milestones that it must hit.\n\"Overall, we are seeing the CHIPS Act as a critical thing that we've invested a lot of time and energy into, and as we said on our earnings call, we're disappointed by the time that it's taken to get done,\" Gelsinger said.\n\"It's well over two years since the CHIPS Act passed. And over that period, I've invested $30 billion in US manufacturing and we've seen $0 from the CHIPS Act. This has taken too long. We need to get it finished.\"\nTo be sure, Wall Street still sees a bumpy road ahead for Intel.\nStory Continues\nIntel faces an \"uphill battle\" to turn itself around and compete with the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Taiwan's TSMC (TSM), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari recently told Yahoo Finance.\nHe added the company will need some time to get its technology \u2014 notably AI chips \u2014 on par with its rivals, if they can do it at all.\nAnd BofA analyst Vivek Arya struck a cautious tone on Intel in a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast (listen here).\nGelsinger also clarified the company's relationship with TSMC to Yahoo Finance.\nReuters reported that Gelsinger made comments early on in his Intel tenure that strained the relationship with the semiconductor manufacturing giant. In turn, TSMC pulled a discount it was giving Intel on 3-nanometer wafers.\n\"They are an awesome company. They have just created the foundry model. They service customers extremely well, and they service us well. And, Lunar Lake, the AI PC that we spoke about, we couldn't do it without TSMC \u2014 they've been critical to that project's success,\" Gelsinger said.\n\"That said, we want to be a Western foundry at scale, and we think that's seminally important for the Western world. ... And finally, I supply them with some of our advanced equipment as well. So it's a complex relationship but critically important for Intel, for TSMC, for the industry,\" added Gelsinger, who called TSMC a customer and a competitor that they have a great partnership with.\nIntel shares are down 55% year to date.\n\u2022 USD\n(INTC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe earnings rundown\nNet Sales: -6% year over year to $13.3 billion vs. estimate of $13.02 billion\nClient Computing Sales: $7.3 billion vs. estimate of $7.46 billion\nData Center & AI Sales: $3.3 billion vs. $3.15 billion\nNetwork & Edge Sales: $1.5 billion vs. $1.39 billion\nMobileye Sales: $485 million vs. $485.5 million\nIntel Foundry Sales: $4.4 billion vs. $4.44 billion\nAdjusted Gross Margin: 18% vs. 38% estimate\nAdjusted EPS: -$0.46 (+$0.41 a year ago) vs. estimate for -$0.03\nWhat else caught our attention: Fourth quarter guidance\nNet Sales: $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion vs. estimate of $13.63 billion\nAdjusted EPS: $0.12 vs. $0.06 estimate\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMicrosoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from \u201cthird parties\u201d weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software.\n\u201cMicrosoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can\u2019t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,\u201d wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\nPersistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft\u2019s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen.\nCEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark. (MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN via Getty Images\n\u201cAs long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow \u2026 the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.\u201d\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. \u201cAs we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,\u201d said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company\u2019s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be \u201clikely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.\u201d\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u2019 quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company\u2019s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday.\nStory Continues\nTo be sure, Big Tech companies\u2019 AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google\u2019s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on megacap tech stocks Thursday.\nMeta said it expects \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.\"\nNvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the BofA's List Of AI & Semiconductor Stocks That Fund Managers Love & Hate: 16 Stocks On The Manager Radar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate.\nThe initial wave of artificial intelligence investing has shaken up the stock market. Suddenly, technology stocks are divided between those that have exposure to AI and those that don't. The former category has soared to set records while the latter has been lackluster because of the state of sluggishness in the non-AI business world.\nWithin AI stocks that have outdone themselves, semiconductor stocks are a standout. Additionally, just as is the case with broader technology stocks, semiconductor stocks are also divided between those with AI and non-AI exposure. The best example of the former category is Wall Street's top AI stock pick. This stock is of a firm that designs and sells GPUs used to process AI workloads. Its shares are up 845% since the 2023 start and have set multiple records since OpenAI's Chat GPT became publicly available.\nOn the flip side, another semiconductor stock has floundered during the same period even though it's one of the oldest and largest semiconductor companies in the world. This stock belongs to a firm that is also one of the only three companies in the world that can manufacture high-end semiconductors and it is the only one which is headquartered in the US. While the GPU designer's shares have gained 845%, over the same time, this semiconductor stock is down 13.9%, and year to date the shares have bled an unbelievable 53.14%.\nTherein lies the bifurcation between semiconductor stocks that is fueled by the artificial intelligence wave. However, these returns might belong to the first stage of AI stocks only, implying that other semiconductor companies could also see gains provided robust AI software demand and the ability of firms to monetize their products.\u00a0 We covered a lot of such potential stocks as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks.\nIn this list, there were five semiconductor stocks. Four of these are semiconductor manufacturers while the remaining stock is the firm whose designs are the backbone of the modern-day smartphone industry. The stocks are ranked 19th, 16th, 14th, 8th, and 6th. Looking at their year-to-date performance, these stocks are up roughly 45%, 51.7%, 65.7%, 97.8%, and 122% year-to-date, respectively. Safe to say, the AI wave has been kind to these stocks. The next step in our brief analysis is to see what analysts believe the future holds for these firms. To do this, one particularly useful ratio is the forward price to earnings since it gauges the current price to analyst estimates of future earnings.\nStory Continues\nFor these five phase two AI semiconductor stocks, the forward P/E ratios in respective orders are roughly 31.25, 50.51, 29.41, 25.19, and 99 times. The forward P/E ratio for global and US semiconductor stocks is 45.77 so most of these stocks are fairly valued. Consequently, this implies that in case of an AI correction that sees investor sentiment evaporate for any reason, these stocks might not be hit as hard as those speculating about an 'AI bubble' might worry, but if Wall Street finds more reasons to add to its AI euphoria, then their valuation might further bloom for more gains.\nShifting gears, the average forward P/E ratio for the semiconductor industry also leads us to wonder which stocks are driving this average value higher. After all, the six AI chip stocks we've covered above include some of the biggest companies in the world. However, high P/E ratios commonly belong to smaller companies that earn small profits but have a much higher share price. Two stocks that we've identified that have at least 2x the average forward P/E ratio are both unprofitable right now. The one with the higher forward P/E ratio of 196.08 ranks 20th on our list of Piper Sandler\u2019s Top Technical Stock Picks: 20 Best Stocks while the second with a beefy ratio of 133.33 ranked 32nd on this list of AI stocks that were recently trending.\nSo, the next question to ask is, what makes these stocks so special that despite the fact that neither is currently profitable, investors have valued their shares more than 100 times over their projected earnings? Well, starting from the first stock with the higher P/E ratio, this firm is one of the few hardened integrated circuit manufacturers in the US. It makes radiation-resistant chips for the US military and its tools enable chip designs at various nodes. The second stock, which is up 49% year to date, is a specialty chip manufacturer that makes and sells silicon-based timing devices as an alternative to quartz-based products. These are used in applications such as edge computing and 5G networks - systems that are closer to end users and therefore must endure more strenuous working environments.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of semiconductor stocks that fund managers love and hate according to BofA, we used its recent list of semiconductor stocks that were popular or losing popularity with fund managers. The list was divided into two sections based on expansion or decline in ownership.\u00a0 Stocks within each category were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. For an interesting exercise, you can also compare these stocks with those on our lists of Goldman Sachs\u2019 List Of Stocks That Hedge & Mutual Funds Love & Hate: 28 Stocks On The Mutual and Hedge Funds Radar.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 130\nSection: Gaining Popularity\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a diversified technology company with a presence in the semiconductor and SaaS industries. It has exposure to the semiconductor industry via modems, network controllers, network processors, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These allow Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) products to operate in the smartphone, laptop, and data center industries. The firm also benefits from its ASIC business as it allows it to. work with companies interested in designing their custom AI chips. Consequently, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0 has a wide semiconductor moat which allows it to profit from several industries. Its cybersecurity business adds margin-heavy revenue to the income statement, making Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) one of the most well-rounded firms in the world. However, with Apple's propensity to shift to its in-house chips, the firm could see headwinds in the future if Apple decides to self-design and make chips such as MacBook WiFi modules.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA's list that fund managers love and hate. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Courtyards\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nChicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow\nMuddling the Message Around \u2018Climate Havens\u2019\nThe AI startup and chipmaker are also consulting with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world\u2019s largest chip contract manufacturer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. OpenAI has been planning a custom chip and working on such uses for the technology for around a year, the people said, but the discussions are still at an early stage.\nOpenAI declined to comment. A representative for Broadcom didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and a TSMC spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on rumors and speculation. Reuters reported on OpenAI\u2019s ongoing talks with Broadcom and TSMC on Tuesday. The Information reported in June that Broadcom had discussed making an AI chip for OpenAI.\nThe process for taking a chip from design to production is long and expensive. OpenAI is less focused on graphics processing units, chips that are used to train and build generative AI models \u2014 a market that has been cornered by Nvidia Corp. Instead, it\u2019s looking for a specialized chip that will run the software and respond to user requests, a process called inference. Investors and analysts expect the need for chips to support inference will only grow as more tech companies use AI models to field more complex tasks.\nOpenAI may continue to research setting up its own network of foundries, or chip factories, one of the people said, but the startup has realized that working with partners on custom chips is a quicker, attainable path for now. Reuters earlier reported that OpenAI was pulling back from the effort of establishing its own chip manufacturing capacity.\nBroadcom shares closed up 4.2% to $179.24 in New York trading on Tuesday. Even before the latest gain, they were up 54% this year. TSMC\u2019s US-traded shares closed more than 1% higher.\nBroadcom is the largest designer of application-specific integrated circuits \u2014 chips designed to fit a single purpose specified by the customer. The company\u2019s biggest customer in this area is Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Broadcom also works with Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\nStory Continues\nWhen asked last month whether he has new customers for the business, given the huge demand for AI training, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that he will only add to his short list of customers when projects hit volume shipments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy product to deploy for any customer, and so we do not consider proof of concepts as production volume,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call.\nOpenAI\u2019s services require massive amounts of computing power to develop and run \u2014 with much of that coming from Nvidia chips. To meet the demand, the industry has been scrambling to find alternatives to Nvidia. That\u2019s included embracing processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and developing in-house versions.\nOpenAI is also actively planning investments and partnerships in data centers, the eventual home for such AI chips. The startup\u2019s leadership has pitched the US government on the need for more massive data centers and CEO Sam Altman has sounded out global investors, including some in the Middle East, to finance the effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stretch,\u201d OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told Bloomberg Television on Monday. \u201cStretch from a capital perspective but also my own learning.

          "whole_article": "One of my favorite ways to pick winning stocks by combining two of the most effective methods out there; the Zacks Rank and momentum. The Zacks Rank is a highly effective quantitative strategy that aggregates all analyst ratings of a stock and converts them into a simple ranking. Momentum is one of the most well documented edge and is well known as a premier anomaly for investors to utilize for successful trading.\nTogether, these two techniques have helped me detect dozens of huge winners in the stock market and right now they have identified three highly compelling stock picks. Arista Networks (ANET), Tesla (TSLA) and ServiceNow (NOW) all boast a top Zacks Rank and an A+ technical momentum setup, leading me to believe that they may be huge winners in the coming weeks and months.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla: Bullish Setup and Strong Buy Stock\nTesla stock has been on a rather volatile and uncertain path this year as electric vehicle sales have slowed markedly. However, CEO Elon Musk is a master of surprising to the upside, and with humanoid robots, self-driving cars and a multitude of other side-bets within Tesla, there is always the potential for a huge run in the stock.\nOver the last two months, analysts have started to upgrade their earnings estimates for Tesla, and it now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 13.4% over the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have jumped by 7.5% over the same period.\nBut most notable is the technical chart pattern forming in Tesla stock price. After gapping higher following its quarterly earnings report, the price action has been building a highly compelling descending wedge. If the stock can trade above the $250 level, it would signal a breakout and may send the stock on another major bull run. Alternatively, if it loses the $240 level of support, the pattern will be invalidated, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nArista Networks: Stock Breaking out Now\nArista Networks, a leading provider of high-performance networking solutions primarily for data centers and cloud computing, is another stock to watch. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, ANET also boasts strong earnings growth forecasts and sits in the top 13% of the Zacks Industry Rank.\nOver the next three to five years, Arista Networks is projected to increase its earnings per share by an impressive 15.3% annually. Sales are also expected to grow nicely, with estimates of a 16.3% increase this year and 17.4% next year.\nStory Continues\nArista Networks stock is also breaking out of its technical pattern today. After building out a bull flag over the last month, ANET is staging a clear breakout. If the stock can hold above the $400 level, it should be the start of another rally. However, if it reverses and loses the breakout level, it may be a sign that the stock needs more time before climbing higher.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nServiceNow: Poised for Growth and a Bullish Breakout\nServiceNow is a cloud computing company that offers a suite of software solutions for IT service management, human resources, customer service, and more. These products help organizations automate routine tasks, enhance productivity, and improve employee and customer experience.\nServiceNow is a rapidly growing technology company that also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Earnings are projected to grow 24.7% annually over the next three to five years, while sales are expected to climb 22.3% this year and 20.1% next year.\nLike the other two stocks, NOW stock looks to be developing a very bullish technical pattern. After beating earnings estimates and gapping higher, the price action has been consolidating into a picture-perfect bull flag. Today, NOW stock is bumping up against the upper level of resistance, and if it can break out above the $955 level, it should send the stock significantly higher. However, if it loses the $930 level of support, investors may want to hold off and wait for other opportunities.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy NOW, ANET and TSLA Shares?\nThe current setups for Arista Networks, Tesla, and ServiceNow are quite convincing, blending strong fundamental growth with technical momentum. Each company boasts robust earnings growth forecasts, competitive market positions, and favorable chart patterns, making them solid candidates for those seeking high-potential momentum plays.\nFor investors with an appetite for growth and momentum, NOW, ANET, and TSLA offer a balanced blend of technical and fundamental indicators suggesting strong performance ahead. As always, keeping an eye on key price levels and being a keen risk manager will be key for trading them successfully.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "The market for ServiceNow, Inc.'s (NYSE:NOW) shares didn't move much after it posted weak earnings recently. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nSee our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-history\nZooming In On ServiceNow's Earnings\nOne key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.\nServiceNow has an accrual ratio of -0.40 for the year to September 2024. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$3.4b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$1.34b. ServiceNow shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On ServiceNow's Profit Performance\nAs we discussed above, ServiceNow's accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is a positive for the company. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that ServiceNow's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at an extremely impressive rate over the last three years. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing ServiceNow at this point in time. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for ServiceNow and you'll want to know about these.\nStory Continues\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of ServiceNow's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "Bill McDermott is very intense.\u00a0When he first joined ServiceNow as CEO in 2019\u2014he was previously CEO of SAP\u2014he met all 7,000 employees and shook hands with every single one of them.\n\u201cIn the first hundred days I was here, I travelled the whole world. The whole world. I met every single person that works for this company in person, and shook their hand.\u201d\nHandshake intensity is a thing, in McDermott's world.\nThe first handshake is incredibly important, he says. It\u2019s part of his mindset, especially for dealing with clients. He advises sales people, upon entering a room with a prospective client, to \u201cfind the decision-maker and shake his hand, but be the last one to let go.\u201d\nHe spoke to Fortune recently in a penthouse suite at the Four Seasons hotel in London, during a business trip to meet clients.\nQuestion 1: Does this handshake thing really work?\n\u201cYes, it does.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not a perfunctory exercise to greet somebody. It's not a perfunctory exercise to shake somebody's hand. They have to know you're in the room and you have to let them know that you care,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo just to shake hands as if it's just some standard thing to do is not enough.\u201d\n(So, was my handshake any good? \u201cYou were fine. I wasn't judging you.\u201d)\nMcDermott\u2019s stewardship of ServiceNow is certainly working. Five years later, ServiceNow has 26,000 employees, revenues of $2.8 billion per quarter and a market cap of more than $195 billion.\nThe AI-driven enterprise software company counts clients such as IBM, KPMG, and Deloitte, for whom it provides a vast range of back-end software that handles customer service, IT operations, security, and new employee on-boarding, among dozens of other services.\nThe handshake thing is a good example of McDermott\u2019s intense, driven style. This is a man who only sleeps for five hours a night. He wakes up at 5 a.m., reads three newspapers, drinks an espresso, does a light workout and walks his dog, Amber. He\u2019s in the office by 8 a.m. He usually continues working until 11 p.m. at night.\nQuestion 2: Can you really get by on just five hours\u2019 sleep?\n\u201cFive hours a night, you know, which is fine,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the week, you know, like it's \u2018go time.\u2019\u201d\nHe sleeps a bit more on weekends.\nQuestion 3: Does ServiceNow have supply issues with Nvidia?\nMost products offered by ServiceNow are driven by AI.\nSo is he getting what he needs from Nvidia, the AI chipmaker that has been accused of not being able to meet demand for all its customers?\n\u201cPerhaps we're fortunate because we have such a strategic relationship but Nvidia has fulfilled all of our requirements and done a great job,\u201d he says.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe started building models with Jensen [Huang, the CEO] several years ago, and we were the first mover in enterprise software building with Nvidia's GPU stack.\u201d\nQuestion 4: Will you cave to Robby Starbuck?\nMcDermott isn\u2019t afraid of the usual culture-war controversies that have come to bedevil leaders at large corporations. ServiceNow, for instance, has a well-developed, public facing DEI program, of the type that has lately become unfashionable.\nRobby Starbuck\u2014the conservative activist who organizes boycotts of companies that he believes are too \u201cwoke\u201d\u2014recently forced Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson, among others, to back away from their DEI initiatives.\nSo what will McDermott do if Starbuck comes calling?\n\u201cWell the good news about ServiceNow is we haven't played \u2018acronym bingo,\u2019\u201d McDermott says.\n\u201cIf you're not growing and you're managing and all you talk about is corporate acronyms, that could be a problem for that phone call. But when you're growing like we are, we have to source talent from every corner of the earth to keep up with the pace of our growth. So if we didn't believe in diversity, if we didn't have an equitable and an inclusive culture, there's no way we could be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. So I think that call would be pretty simple.\u201d\nQuestion 5: Is working remotely OK?\nMcDermott is not a fan of 100% remote working. He asked the company to return to the office about two years ago. ServiceNow currently has a flexible policy in which some employees come in two days a week unless they are designated remote workers.\n\u201cI believe strongly that people do their best work in person.\u201d\n\u201cWe need everybody in the company to cross-pollinate and innovate and work as teams. So, basically, when I asked the company to do it, I didn't have to mandate it. I just had to say, we need it now, we have to hit the accelerator, people came back.\u201d\nBut when the CEO says \u201cwe need it now,\u201d surely that's a mandate?\n\u201cIf they trust you, it's not a mandate. It's a desire. It is \u2018I need you. I trust you. I want you with me.\u2019 I'm not telling you I have to have you tied to a chair, and I'm not telling you I'm going to fire you if you don't do it. I'm telling you, I need you to do it and I don't ask for things that I don't need. And they responded next day, the parking lots are all full. There\u2019s a difference between leading and managing and I don't think it's healthy to actually have people that feel forced into things,\u201d he says. \u201cOne volunteer is worth 10 pressed people.\u201d\nQuestion 6: Are you a micromanager or do you prefer to delegate?\nThis question is important because McDermott has, in the past, insisted on riding along on sales calls with his staff.\n\u201cI hire people that are the best in the world at what they do and I trust them with my life. I think trust is the ultimate human currency and I think the best leaders hire people that are substantially better than them. In every area of domain expertise. So, if you have a CFO, they have to be better than you at finance. If you have a CHRO, they have to know more about the people equation than you do. If you hire a head of engineering, they have to be an extraordinary exemplar of an engineering manager and they should know a lot more than you do. In other words, when I look around the table of my leadership team, I'm humbled, that's how good they are.\u201d\n\u201cI also believe strongly that we have to go into the details and we have to be with our customers and we have to be shoulder to shoulder with the customer so you understand the pain that they deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cI become obsessed with their problems. And I want 26,000 people to be obsessed with their problems, so we come up with new solutions to make them better.\u201d\nQuestion 7: What is the most difficult thing you have tackled as CEO?\nGrowing the company from 7,000 people to 26,000 must have involved some difficulties. But McDermott won't admit it.\n\u201cI love scale. I came here from a company that had a hundred thousand people. So my whole life has been spent scaling companies, so the things that people might find difficult, we find great joy in, we bring new people into the culture, we get new people to buy into the\u00a0purpose.\u201d\nThat sounds like PR spin. Surely there must have been pain points while growing ServiceNow?\n\u201cI've encountered thousands of challenges, but is that a difficulty? Or is that a challenge? Is that A setback? Or is that an opportunity,\u201d he says.\nAnd then, just in case you needed a reminder of the level of intensity he is working at, he adds:\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what is pain? Your pain might be my pleasure.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Top findings include a group of AI Pacesetters\u2014government organizations relatively more advanced in using AI and other emerging technologies\u2014that are driving efficiency and achieving better outcomes than organizations that have been slower to adopt AI-powered workflows and automation. Key insights illuminate the unique ways Pacesetters use AI to improve citizen and employee experiences, strengthen compliance, and scale business processes.\nAccording to the research, many government organizations have yet to reap the full benefits of digital technology and relatively few are leveraging innovation to advance their diverse missions. The report outlines best practices implemented by Pacesetters that can be replicated in other government organizations to improve outcomes.\n\"In today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, governments need AI-driven solutions to meet the evolving expectations of citizens and employees,\" said Jonathan Alboum, Federal CTO at ServiceNow. \"This report reinforces that leading governments are already reaping the benefits of AI through accelerated service delivery, citizen experience, and employee productivity. Whether you\u2019re a Pacesetter or still in the beginning stages of a digital journey, these findings show that the future is promising for those willing to embrace AI.\"\nKey findings from The State of AI-Powered Transformation in Government include:\nImproving Speed of Mission\nPacesetters significantly improve their speed and agility by integrating automation into their organizations\u2019 processes. This profoundly impacts both government employees and the citizens they serve.\nFaster time to value with more benefits. Most Pacesetters (61%) achieve a 1.5X faster return on digital investments and report greater outcomes from those investments \u2013 including higher asset utilization and return (50%), improved compliance and risk management (49%), and faster public services (41%).\nAutomating workflows with end-to-end platforms. Pacesetters are making greater progress in implementing end-to-end platforms, with 67% expecting to make advanced progress within the next three years. Currently, 59% have invented new cross-functional workflows that leverage human and AI collaboration.\nAccelerating productivity and ability to scale transformation. Pacesetters boost productivity via specific digital solutions, such as mobile apps (64%), performance management systems (43%), and AI-enabled tools (38%). Those investments are paying off for Pacesetters, measured by improved staff retention (49%), employee upskilling and reskilling (44%), and productivity (41%).\nStory Continues\nAI-Powered Citizen Service Delivery\nPacesetters are finding new momentum within their Citizen Experience (CX) efforts through unique uses of AI and other digital solutions. This is not only improving citizen service delivery but also helping build trust.\nReshaping government services with AI. Governments are using AI in various ways to accelerate citizen service delivery. The top uses for AI among Pacesetters include personalization of citizen communication and engagement, continuous service improvement with feedback loops, and citizen queries and recommendations.\nTechnology improves citizen experience and builds trust. Pacesetters are making greater use of apps and automation to reach citizens. Compared to the general population of government agencies in our survey, Pacesetters are more likely to deploy mobile apps that citizens can use to access government services (47%), digital identities for easy and secure access to public services (46%), and automated responses to citizen problems or requests (44%).\nTech investments are beginning to drive CX improvements.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the UBS' Top Tech Based Disruptive Stocks For 2030: Top 29 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) Thrives with Strong Growth and Profitability\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 1.88%\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the biggest SaaS companies in the world. The firm provides products that enable users to automate their business processes and manage human resource operations, IT operations, and others. The firm has raked in $1.1 billion in trailing twelve-month net income and its shares are up 33.5% year to date. Since it\u2019s a SaaS stock, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u2019s narrative depends on its ability to sustain revenue levels, maintain profitability, grow its customer base, and increase the portion of larger deals within the overall mix. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) appears to be executing well on these fronts. During the second quarter, the firm grew customers with annual recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% and its committed remaining performance obligations by 31% to a whopping $18.6 billion. The latter is a particularly important metric since it measures the money that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is nearly guaranteed to receive in the future. This helps evaluate the firm\u2019s future cash flows.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in\u00a0Adobe\u00a0and\u00a0ServiceNow\u00a0earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 6th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ServiceNow, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NOW a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $13.83.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.3%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.36 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for NOW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Investors in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) had a good week, as its shares rose 3.2% to close at US$951 following the release of its quarterly results.

This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

Some leaders like Comerica\u2019s (CMA) chief banking officer, Peter Sefzik, have indicated that they want to see another 50 to 100 basis points cut. Krisiloff says the earnings calls from financial executives show \u201cthe gap between the confidence in financial markets versus the real economy.\u201d\nKrisiloff adds, \u201cI think everybody is kind of waiting for more rate cuts here. I think even the Fed has just acknowledged that the rate cuts that they've had so far are just to bring us to a somewhat less restrictive stance. They still want to get to a neutral stance. But I think many actors in the economy are looking for a stimulative stance, and so the Fed's hand may really be pushed toward that stimulative stance over time.\u201d\nConsumer resilience is also a common theme of third quarter corporate earnings calls. \u201cResilient has been the most used word on earnings calls for the last two years now, as we've all been surprised that a recession really hasn't come through despite the higher interest rate environment. The consumer has just continued to spend.\u201d\nHe continues, \u201cWhat you're really seeing is a continuation of a bifurcation of the consumer where high- and moderate-income consumers are still spending a lot, and low-income consumers are really under pressure \u2026 I think what we're seeing right now in terms of consumer resilience is that employment is still carrying the day. As long as people are getting a steady paycheck and feel secure in their jobs, people are spending, and so that is powering the economy. The consumer is really the underpinning force of all of this.\"\nStory Continues\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\nView Comments"

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NOW.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations, released its 10-Q filing on October 24, 2024. The company continues to demonstrate financial strength, with a notable increase in revenues from $6,534 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $8,027 million in the same period in 2024. Subscription revenues, the core of ServiceNow's business model, surged from $6,315 million to $7,780 million year-over-year. Net income, however, showed a decrease from $1,436 million to $1,041 million, reflecting strategic investments in growth and development. ServiceNow's financial position remains robust, with comprehensive income rising to $490 million from $176 million, and cash flows from operating activities increasing significantly from $1,793 million to $2,632 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\nDecoding ServiceNow Inc (NOW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\nStrengths\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) has established itself as a market leader in IT service management. Its innovative Now Platform has been pivotal in maintaining this position, offering a suite of services that cater to various business functions beyond IT, such as HR, customer service, and security operations. The company's commitment to R&D, as evidenced by its $1,875 million investment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has resulted in a continuous stream of product enhancements and new offerings, ensuring that ServiceNow remains at the forefront of the industry.\nFinancial Performance: ServiceNow's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and successful business model. The company's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and recurring revenue stream, which has seen a substantial increase from $6,315 million to $7,780 million in subscription revenues year-over-year. This financial stability is further reinforced by a solid gross profit margin, which stood at $6,371 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWeaknesses\nDependence on Subscription Revenues: While ServiceNow's subscription model is a strength, it also presents a risk. The company's heavy reliance on subscription revenues means that any significant churn in its customer base could adversely affect its financial performance. As of September 30, 2024, the company reported a renewal rate of 98%, indicating a stable customer base, but this also underscores the importance of maintaining high retention rates.\nStory Continues\nIncreasing Operating Expenses: ServiceNow's aggressive investment in sales and marketing, as well as research and development, has led to increased operating expenses, which grew from $4,637 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $5,381 million in the same period in 2024. While these investments are crucial for growth and maintaining a competitive edge, they also put pressure on the company's margins and profitability.\nOpportunities\nExpansion into Non-IT Workflows: ServiceNow has been expanding its workflow automation logic to non-IT areas, which presents a significant opportunity for growth. By leveraging its existing technology and expertise, the company can tap into new markets and diversify its revenue streams. The increase in RPO to $19.5 billion, with 48% representing cRPO, indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and the potential for further market penetration.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: ServiceNow's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have been instrumental in expanding its product offerings and enhancing its platform capabilities. The company's ability to integrate new technologies and services from these partnerships and acquisitions can drive innovation and open up new markets, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive enterprise workflow solution provider.\nThreats\nCompetitive Landscape: The market for enterprise IT solutions is highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants continuously vying for market share. ServiceNow must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage. The company's significant investment in R&D is a response to this threat, but it also needs to be balanced with cost management to protect profitability.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rate hikes, inflation, and geopolitical tensions can impact ServiceNow's business. While the company has not experienced any significant impact on its liquidity or operations due to recent macroeconomic events, ongoing global economic uncertainties could affect customer spending and, consequently, ServiceNow's financial performance.\nIn conclusion, ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, driven by its innovative platform and subscription-based revenue model. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape and global economic uncertainties while managing its reliance on subscription revenues and increasing operating expenses. ServiceNow's strategic expansion into non-IT workflows and its focus on partnerships and acquisitions present significant opportunities for growth. As the company continues to invest in innovation and market expansion, it is well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.
