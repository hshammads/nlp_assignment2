Here's how each stock performed.\nTesla \u2014 reported on Wednesday 23 October\nElon Musk's Tesla got the group off to a strong start, when it reported its third-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday 23 October.\nWhile the results were mixed, investors cheered the company's beats on earnings per share and higher gross margins, with the stock surging nearly 14.5% in after-hours trading.\nTesla posted revenue of $25.18bn (\u00a319.18bn), which was less than the $25.4bn expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. However, this was higher than the $25.05bn in reported in the second quarter and topped the $23.04bn it posted for the same period last year.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.72, was ahead of an anticipated $0.60, on adjusted net income of $2.5 billion and free cash flow of $2.9bn.\nTesla's closely-watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.\nRead more: IMF upgrades UK growth forecast in budget boost for Rachel Reeves\nIn its earnings deck, Tesla said: \"Preparations remain under way for our offering of new vehicles \u2014 including more affordable models \u2014 which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025.\"\nMusk then said in an earnings call that Tesla's volume growth could be between 20% and 30% next year.\nStory continues\nThese details were welcome news to investors, in light of recent updates that disappointed markets. Tesla recently announced third-quarter deliveries that slightly missed expectations, while the company's highly-anticipated robotaxi event left investors wanting more details.\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said this strong set of results was a \"reminder that, for all its recent challenges, it is one of the few operators to genuinely make the manufacture of electric vehicles pay\".\nHe added: \"The next key test for Tesla is to hit its targeted year-on-year increase in vehicle deliveries for 2024 which will require a pretty sizable acceleration in the remainder of the year.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(TSLA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nAlphabet \u2014 reported on Tuesday 29 October\nGoogle-parent Alphabet smashed expectations with its fiscal third quarter earnings, driving a surge in its shares.\nThe search giant posted earnings per share of $2.12 for the third quarter, which was up 37% on the same period last year and beat forecasts of $1.83, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $88.27bn for the quarter ended 30 September, up 15% on last year and ahead of estimates of $86.44bn.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of the cloud unit in an earnings call on Tuesday, noting that the company's AI portfolio is attracting new customers and leading to larger deals. Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, surpassing expectations.\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the medium and long-term threats at play for Alphabet \u2014 the Department of Justice and AI agents \u2014 these are a very clean set of numbers.\"\nEarlier this month, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it was considering whether to recommend the break up of Google to rein in its dominance in the search engine market.\nThe DOJ said in a court filing that it was considering options, including \"behavioural and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search\".\nThis update came after a landmark ruling in August, in which a US district court said Google had illegally monopolised the online search market.\nRead more: Bitcoin investors eye rally if Trump beats Harris in US election\nIn response to DOJ's latest court filing, Google released a blog post entitled: \"DOJ\u2019s radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\"\n\"With new and improving features with search, Google has a decent future even with the DOJ trying to break it up,\" said Barringer.\n\"YouTube has also been very stable which has allowed the business to focus on the areas it needs to, without worrying about its other core components.\n\u201cInterestingly, the cloud business was growing strongly and should provide a good read across for the rest of the sector.\"\nBarringer said that while innovation was coming through in the business, \"the threats are big and thus the stock will struggle despite good short-term trends. Ultimately, investors await what will happen with the DOJ.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMeta Platforms \u2014 reported on Wednesday 30 October\nMeta disappointed on investor expectations when it shared its guidance for the fourth quarter in its latest results.\nMeta guided to revenue of between $45bn and $48bn for the fourth quarter, with analysts looking for $46.09bn. The company also said it expects capital expenses to grow significantly in 2025.\nWhile this latest set of results weighed on shares, the stock is still up nearly 61% year-to-date.\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said that another area of disappointment for investors in the third quarter figures was daily active users growth on Meta's social media platforms and apps. The company said this figure was up 5% to 3.29 billion individuals in Q3, but this missed the 3.31 billion market forecast.\n\"It\u2019s not simply enough for Meta to move ahead, it needs to stay in the fast lane at all times as far as the market is concerned. Investors typically care about the short term and they want more, more, more,\" he said.\nRead more: Record number of millionaires to leave UK amid tax increase fears\n\u201cEven though Meta owns some of the world\u2019s most popular social media platforms, it still faces significant competition from the likes of TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube. Every minute someone uses a rival platform is a missed opportunity for Meta to generate advertising income,\" he added.\nHowever, it posted beats on earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, earnings per share came in at $6.03, which was ahead of an anticipated $5.25, based on consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $40.5bn for the third quarter, beating forecasts of $40.2bn, as well as rising on last year's figure of $34.1bn.\nCoatsworth said Meta was another company spending big on AI. He highlighted that \"improvements to its AI-driven feed and video recommendations led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year. Meta AI is now helping to improve search functionality on its social media platforms, answering questions and being deployed to edit images.\"\n\"It has further applications such as helping individuals with coding and working as a chatbot,\" he added. \"On top of this, Meta\u2019s Llama large language models are being used by companies and organisations including the US government and the company continues to improve its capabilities.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMicrosoft \u2014 reported on Wednesday 30 October\nAnother tech company that didn't quite match Wall Street's expectations with its latest results was Microsoft, despite also beating forecasts on key financial metrics.\nMicrosoft said commercial revenue which includes cloud services sales, came in at $38.9bn compared to expectations of $38.1bn. The company's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure business, brought in $24.1bn in the quarter, up 20% year over year.\nHowever, Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said that the \"downbeat stock reaction is likely due to guidance given on the call\".\n\"Margins are expected to come under pressure next quarter as the ramp-up in AI spending hits the cost line, and with Azure growth expected at 31-32%, that would mark a slowdown quarter-on-quarter,\" he added.\nRead more: Lloyds profits flat but beat estimates\nEven so, Microsoft still posted earnings per share of $3.30, which were ahead of of analyst forecasts of $3.10, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue of $65.6bn also topped expectations of $64.5bn.\nOne of the latest areas of competition for major technology firms is digital agents powered by AI, with Microsoft jumping into the race last week.\nMicrosoft recently announced the rollout of its Copilot AI features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. These AI tools, known as autonomous agents, are custom-built applications that can handle specific tasks, with the aim of freeing up employees to focus on more strategic work.\nIn full-year results released at the end of June, Microsoft said revenue was up 16% to $245bn, while operating income had risen 24% to $109bn. In addition, net income had grown 22% to $88bn.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView quote details\nAmazon \u2014 reported on Thursday 31 October\nE-commerce giant Amazon posted stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than expected on Wall Street.\nAmazon reported earnings per share of $1.43, which was ahead of estimates of $1.16, while revenue came in at $158.9bn against forecasts of $157.29.\nThe company also said it expected revenue in the range of $181.5bn to $188.5bn in the fourth quarter, versus analyst forecasts of $186.36bn.\nIn terms of operating income, Amazon said it expected this be between $16bn and $20bn in final quarter of the year, compared with estimates of $17.49bn.\nShares popped on the back of this latest earnings release, up 31% year-to-date.\nRead more: The best stocks to buy in the UK, according to Barclays\nMamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Amazon's \"online sales and international growth both proved strong, while AWS remained steady. Much of the online success is as a result of consumers continuing to be price cautious.\"\nShe highlighted that Amazon's cloud business results came in line with expectations with revenue up 19%.\n\"AWS is benefiting from AI budgets being implemented by businesses, with demand currently exceeding capacity, and while traditional workload migration also remains healthy,\" Valechha said.\n\u201cAll in all, this was a positive update from Amazon and investors seemed to agree with the stock trading well in the after hours,\" she added. \"Given softer numbers earlier this year it is good to see Amazon bounce back and live up to expectations once again.\u201d\nAmazon's second quarter disappointed in terms of revenue performance.\nWhile Amazon's earnings of $1.26 per share exceeded expectations of $1.04, net sales of $147.98bn was just shy of an anticipated $148.78bn revenue figure.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView quote details\nApple \u2014 reported on Thursday 31 October\nShares in Apple dipped following the release of its fourth quarter results.\nApple reported earnings per share of $0.97 on revenue on revenue of $94.9bn. The company said it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay \u20ac13bn to Ireland for back taxes.\nWithout the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3bn.\nApple's iPhone sales beat forecasts, at $46.2bn for the quarter, against expectations of $45bn. However, revenue of $24.9bn from its services business, fell short of expectations of $25.2bn.\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: \"Apple is at a major turning point in its career.\nRead more: Dividend stock picks to consider when investing as interest rates fall\n\u201cThe roll-out of its AI-powered Apple Intelligence service could be a powerful catalyst to encourage consumers to upgrade products such as phones and laptops.\n\"Unfortunately, mass upgrades won\u2019t happen overnight as the service is only being rolled out on a phased basis,\" he added. \"That means the market is judging Apple more on what it\u2019s doing today, not what it could do tomorrow, and the pace of growth isn\u2019t strong enough to excite.\"\nHe said that Apple had been \"late to the party with AI and the pace of hardware innovation feels pedestrian compared to previous decades\".\nDespite the criticism around this latest set of results, Coatsworth said it was clear that the business \"has been busy laying the foundations for future growth\".\n\"Each of its core products has a trick up its sleeve to win over the consumer,\" he said.\nIn terms of its Apple Intelligence service, Coatsworth said it \"might take at least another quarter to see if the AI facility is compelling enough to boost sales\".\n\u2022 USD\n(AAPL)\nFollow\nView quote details\nNvidia \u2014 reports on Wednesday 20 November\nNvidia's third quarter earnings are slated for release later in November.

          "whole_article": "Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this social media company have returned -4.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has lost 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $6.70 per share, indicating a change of +25.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.53 points to a change of +51.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5.5%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.08 indicates a change of +11.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $46.98 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.1%. The $162.97 billion and $186.69 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.8% and +14.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $40.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.9%. EPS of $6.03 for the same period compares with $4.39 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +16.18%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Meta Platforms Inc. META, the undisputed leader of the global social media space, reported strong third-quarter 2024 earnings results. The company provided strong guidance buoyed by its extensive thrust on generative artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe stock price of META has soared 58.5% year to date compared with Wall Street\u2019s broad-market index \u2014 the S&P 500\u2019s gain of 20.5%. Despite this, the stock currently has a double-digit upside for the short term.\nMoreover, in the long term, META has a higher earnings per share (EPS) growth rate than the S&P 500 index, which should drive its stock prices in the next 3 to 5 years. Meta Platforms currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of Meta Platforms year to date.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nA Brief Recap of META\u2019s Q3 Earnings Results\nMETA reported third-quarter 2024 earnings of $6.03 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.18%. Revenues of $40.59 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.1%.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, total costs and expenses increased 13.9% year over year to $23.24 billion. As a percentage of revenues, total costs and expenses were 57.3%, significantly down from 59.7% in the year-ago quarter.\nGenerative AI aids META\u2019s advertising revenues (98.9% of Family of Apps revenues), which increased 18.6% year over year to $39.89 billion and accounted for 98.3% of third-quarter revenues.

For 2024, the company still anticipates total expenses between $96 billion and $98 billion.\nMETA continues to expect Reality Labs\u2019 operating losses to increase meaningfully year over year. It expects 2024 capital expenditure in the range of $38-$40 billion, higher than the previous guidance of $37-$40 million.\nStory Continues\nMeta platforms warned that it expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending next year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses.\nFuture Catalysts for META Stock\nMeta Platforms is set to receive initial shipments of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s NVDA new flagship AI chip later this year. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META is set to get B200 Blackwell chips.\nMETA\u2019s AI-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms.\nManagement said that the company will invest $3-$40 billion as capital expenditure in AI initiatives in 2024. Moreover, capital spending is likely to reach more than $50 billion in 2025.\nOn July 24, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA\u2019s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbents like Open AI.\nOn Oct. 24, Meta Platforms entered into a multi-year deal with Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI to allow its AI chatbot access to news content for responses to current events and news questions. This constitutes a significant AI partnership between a tech behemoth and a news publishing giant.\nSolid Earnings Estimate Revisions for META Shares\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently shows revenues of $46.98 billion, suggesting an improvement of 17.1% year over year and EPS of $6.70, indicating an appreciation of 25.7% year over year.\nMoreover, META has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the last seven days. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 20.8% and 50.9%, respectively, for revenues and EPS in 2024. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues and EPS reflects an upside of 14.6% and 11.4%, respectively.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStrong Upside Left for META Shares\nMeta Platforms is currently trading at an attractive valuation compared to its peers. The stock has a forward price/earnings (P/E) of 25.3X, below the industry\u2019s P/E of 31.2X. META has a robust return on equity (ROE) of 35.6% compared with the industry\u2019s ROE of a negative 1%.\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 11.7% from the last closing price of $560.68. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $475-$811. This indicates a maximum upside of 44.6% and a maximum downside of 15.3%.\nMETA currently has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 20.1%, well above the S&P 500\u2019s long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%. Therefore, the risk/reward is strongly in favor of the stock from a long-term perspective.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "The rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence and deep-fake technologies had many dreading the year of the AI election. And as the 2024 campaign winds down, misinformation and disinformation about the election is everywhere online, from foreign bot accounts to billionaire-backed ad campaigns and the candidates themselves.\nSince the 2020 presidential election, the volume and methods for disinformation campaigns have grown, says Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance.\n\u201cThe biggest red flag is that they're going to try to make you reactionary and get you out of your critical thinking process and into your reactionary, emotional thinking process,\u201d he told Fortune.\nA recent survey of voters by YouGov and Tech Policy Press found 65% of Americans believe election-related misinformation on social media has worsened since 2020.\nFake bot accounts and deepfakes are on the rise, often proliferated by foreign adversaries, while platforms like X have loosened efforts to limit misleading content.\nAhead of Election Day, U.S. intelligence officials debunked social media videos, some of which originated in Russia, claiming to show election interference in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\nMeanwhile, former president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance repeated false claims about Haitian immigrants in Ohio that began online. And Elon Musk has boosted right-wing conspiracies about immigrant voting, often via his social media platform.\nThe methods of misinformation\nMusk\u2019s X was under increased scrutiny for amplifying right-wing misinformation in the days leading up to the election. The billionaire tech CEO claimed he was committed to uncensored freedom of speech when he bought the platform formerly known as Twitter for $44 billion in 2022.\nReports show that false claims run rampant under X\u2019s community notes feature\u2014a crowdsourced method of fact-checking meant to replace the watchdogs laid off by Musk. Lately, with Musk all-in for Trump, that includes Musk\u2019s inescapable self-promotion of right-wing rhetoric and political advertising, such as his false claims that Democrats \u201chave imported massive numbers of illegals to swing states.\u201d\nX\u2019s chatbot, Grok, also proliferated incorrect information about voting. The company only changed its answers to redirect users to Vote.gov after five secretaries of state flagged the misinformation. The election officials estimated that millions of people viewed incorrect responses to their questions about the election.\nSome election officials have reportedly hand-delivered personal warnings about spreading election misinformation to Musk. A spokesperson for X told Fortune that the company has communicated with election regulators and other stakeholders to address threats, noting that its civic integrity policy will remain in place through the inauguration. Since Musk purchased Twitter, that policy no longer explicitly bans content that seeks to undermine the outcome of an election.\nStory Continues\nBut X is far from the only platform harboring misinformation. Meta\u2019s Facebook made $1 million from misleading advertisements that suggest the election might be delayed or rigged, which Meta has since removed. A deceptive ad series appearing to come from the Harris campaign, but backed by Musk and other conservatives, also thrived on Facebook.\nThe company blocked new ads about social issues, elections, or politics for the final week of the election\u2014a policy it\u2019s had since 2020. In anticipation of misinformation about vote counts and election integrity after the polls close, Meta told advertisers Monday that it will extend its ban until later this week. A spokesperson for Meta said the company employs around 40,000 people globally working on safety and security.\nOn the encrypted messaging app Telegram, more than 500,000 right-wing users across 50 channels stoked claims that they would question and dispute any outcome other than a Trump victory.\nForeign sources of misinformation\nThe FBI on Saturday warned voters about two deepfake videos that emerged ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election. Both falsely claimed to come from the FBI, with one concerning ballot fraud and another about Kamala Harris\u2019s husband, Doug Emhoff.\nThe BBC reported that those deepfakes were part of a larger Russian operation.\nFederal agencies say Russia, China, and Iran are the most prominent foreign nations spreading disinformation in the U.S. While Russia favors Trump, Iran promotes Harris. China has spread false information about both candidates.\nU.S. intelligence officials also identified a fake video of a Haitian man claiming to cast multiple votes in Georgia as a product of Russian influence. Another video that appeared to show a Pennsylvania poll worker destroying mail-in ballots was similarly attributed to Russian actors.\nSome of the other 300-plus videos impersonated news organizations and posted false claims about Harris and content about unrest and \u201ccivil war,\u201d the BBC found. But it added that most of these videos did not get significant views from real people on X, and instead showed tens of thousands of views that came mainly from bot accounts.\nDespite the \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in disinformation from foreign actors, Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said Monday that she hasn\u2019t seen evidence of adversaries affecting the election. Still, she expects deceptive information about election integrity to spread online in the coming days, until Congress certifies the results on Jan. 6.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

As a result, hackers were able to use inactive pages to forge identities and request password resets for the accounts of other Facebook users. Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.\nIn September, European regulators hit Meta with over $100 million in fines for a 2019 security lapse in which user passwords were temporarily exposed in an un-encrypted form.\nMeta\u2019s South Korean office said it would \u201ccarefully review\u201d the commission\u2019s decision, but didn\u2019t immediately provide more comment.\nIn 2022, the commission fined Google and Meta a combined 100 billion won ($72 million) for tracking consumers\u2019 online behavior without their consent and using their data for targeted advertisements, in the biggest penalties ever imposed in South Korea for privacy law violations.\nStory Continues\nThe commission said then that the two companies didn\u2019t clearly inform users or obtain their consent to collect data about them as they used other websites or services outside their own platforms. It ordered the companies to provide an \u201ceasy and clear\u201d consent process to give people more control over whether to share information about what they do online.\nThe commission also hit Meta with a 6.7 billion won ($4.8 million) fine in 2020 for providing personal information about itsx users to third parties without consent.\nView Comments"

Burberry may lose its spot in the upcoming FTSE 100 reshuffle, according to the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG)'s indicative quarterly review changes for September 2024. The actual review for all FTSE UK indices will be done on 3 September, with final changes being revealed on 4 September, following market close.

Burberry's new strategic focus on iconic products like outerwear and scarves is commendable, and the company is getting more pragmatic in terms of pricing,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, \u201cMoncler\u2019s expertise in outerwear and its marketing prowess could be a game-changer for Burberry, steering the brand back to its core strengths.\u201d\nMoncler dismissed the speculation, with a spokesperson adding that the company \u201cdoes not comment on unsubstantiated rumors.\"\u00a0A Burberry representative mirrored the same statement when approached for comment.\nBurberry\u2019s shares were up as much as 8% during the day on Monday and was up 6% at market close.\nMeta\u2019s eyes on EssilorLuxottica\nElsewhere in the world of luxury fashion, Bloomberg reported \u201crenewed chatter\u201d around tech giant Meta potentially buying a 5% stake in EssilorLuxottica, the eyewear company behind Ray-Ban and Oakley.\nThe two companies joined forces in 2019 to create a pair of glasses powered by Meta\u2019s AI assistant and with a tiny camera on the rim. In September, they announced extending their partnership to redefine \u201cthe potential for wearables in consumers\u2019 lives.\u201d\nEssilorLuxottica\u2019s chief had previously hinted that Meta was considering investing in the company. Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has also spoken about making a \u201csymbolic\u201d investment in the company as a \u201cnice gesture\u201d to solidify the partnership.\nStory Continues\nAn audience member watches the Meta Connect Developer Conference keynote while wearing Ray-Ban Meta 2nd generation smart glasses at Meta's headquarters in Menlo Park, California on Wednesday September 27, 2023.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss.\nArtificial Intelligence is a game changer. According to a PwC report, it could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity while $9.1 trillion is from consumption-side effects. The report also reveals that global GDP will be up to 14% higher in 2030 due to the accelerating development of AI. The greatest productivity gains are likely to go to North America and China, with the former expected to realize the AI benefits faster.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\nHowever, the surge in artificial intelligence will require a huge number of data centers, and it is significantly going to impact how much the world consumes power, and how much that is going to cost. To have an idea, on average, a ChatGPT search needs as much as 10 times more electricity to process as a Google search. That said, AI gathering steam is only going to make the power hunger crazier. According to estimates from Goldman Sachs, the data center demand is going to grow 160% by 2030. Presently, data centers consume about 1-2% of overall power, but the percentage is likely to rise to 3-4% by the end of the decade.\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAs we examine the increasing energy demand of data centers stemming from the surge in AI, it\u2019s worth noting how these advancements are manifesting in practical applications. In its latest breakthrough, Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company that builds reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems, has launched Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u2014their first release in the forthcoming Claude 3.5 model family. The Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency (HumanEval), demonstrating marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural and relatable tone.\nAnother exciting news is how Runway, an AI company shaping the next era of art, entertainment, and human creativity, has launched a new set of advanced AI camera controls for its Gen-3 Alpha Turbo video generation model. These tools allow the user generating videos from text prompts, upload images, or even their footage, to have greater control over the AI-generated settings and characters. Users can even zoom in or out of the scene and subjects without disrupting their realism, creating a more immersive experience of a seemingly 3D world.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, a highly anticipated release that many have been waiting on is seemingly delayed, as per the latest reports. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that his company\u2019s next big model won\u2019t likely be released this year. According to Altman, the company is \"prioritizing\" shipping existing models focused on reasoning and difficult questions.\n\u201cAll of these models have gotten quite complex and we can\u2019t ship as many things in parallel as we\u2019d like to\u201d. He said the company faces \u201climitations and hard decisions\u201d when it comes to allocating compute resources \u201ctowards many great ideas.\u201d - Altman wrote during a Reddit AMA.\nWhen asked about the release of ChatGPT-5, Altman stated that the company has some very good releases this year but \u201cnothing that we are going to call GPT-5.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Rides AI-Powered Ad Revenue Growth; Citi Raises Target, Citing Early AI Gains\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a technology company that develops applications and technologies to help people connect, find communities, as well as grow businesses. The company is a top Artificial Intelligence player in consumer internet, investing heavily in AI-related infrastructure, technology, and products.\nOn October 31, Citi analyst raised the price target on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to $705 from $645 and kept a \"Buy\" rating on the shares after the Q3 report. According to the analyst, Meta continues to gain a share of overall ad budgets, with advertising revenue increasing 20% year-over-year excluding currency, along with ad impressions and pricing growth.

The firm also recommends investors seize any post-earnings selloff in the shares.\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Microsoft Corp., which Nvidia passed last month, has a market cap of $3.06 trillion. Nvidia has soared more than 850% since the end of 2022.\n\u201cOver the past several quarters, it has felt like people basically care about inflation numbers, job numbers, and Nvidia numbers,\u201d said Fall Ainina, director of research at James Investment Research. \u201cNvidia overtaking Apple in market cap not only conveys that it is the biggest beneficiary of the AI infrastructure cycle, but it suggests people expect the AI boom will continue.\u201d\nThe chipmaker accounts for 7% of the weight of the S&P 500 Index and is responsible for about a quarter of the benchmark\u2019s 21% gain this year. Nvidia previously closed with the title of largest company in June, although it only held the record for a day.\nThe biggest companies on Wall Street are all heavily exposed to artificial intelligence: Apple with its newly launched AI iPhones; Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc. with their cloud businesses and AI services; and Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s AI features and ad targeting. With the exception of Apple, these companies are all among Nvidia\u2019s largest customers, and they have stressed their commitment to continuing to spend on AI.\nLast week, Apple\u2019s results underlined concerns about its revenue growth, along with weakness in China. Nvidia will report later this month.\nNot only are the biggest companies by market cap AI plays, but so are the year\u2019s top stock performers. Nvidia\u2019s 183% advance is the third-largest in the S&P 500 this year, behind Vistra Corp. \u2014 the power producer that has seen a surge in demand related to AI \u2014 and data-analysis software firm Palantir Technologies Inc.\nRecent strength has come as the company calmed investor concerns about issues involving its Blackwell chip, which was delayed due to engineering snags, as well as its long-term growth prospects.\nAnalysts expect Nvidia\u2019s revenue to more than double in its current fiscal year and rise another 44% during the following, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wall Street analysts have continually raised estimates for Nvidia\u2019s earnings and profit over the past quarter.\nStory Continues\nBeyond the Blackwell optimism, recent sales from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. showed strong AI demand, while a funding round for OpenAI resulted in a $157 billion valuation.

The fine could also be accompanied by periodic penalty payments, levied on Apple until it complies with the law, said the people, adding that the decision was still being drafted.\nApple spokespeople didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The European Commission declined to comment.\nThe move follows a warning to Apple in June that it must give developers effective means to steer users away from its App Store, or face future penalties. In contrast to traditional antitrust law, the DMA is designed to head off anticompetitive behavior before it is too late to wreck markets for good.\nUnder the law, EU regulators have powers to fine the world\u2019s most powerful tech firms 10% of their global annual sales, 20% in the event of repeated infringements, or periodic fines of as much as 5% of the average daily revenue.\nIn fourth quarter results posted last week, Apple reported sales of $94.9 billion, compared with an average estimate of $94.4 billion. Revenue from the iPhone came in at $46.2 billion, beating estimates of $45 billion.\nApple shares rose less than 1% to $223.45 at the close in New York on Tuesday. They are up 16% this year.\nVestager has locked horns with Apple several times during her period in Brussels. In the Spotify dispute, she accused Apple of blocking its rival from informing users of cheaper deals away from Apple\u2019s App Store.\nStory Continues\nVestager also grabbed the headlines when she ordered Apple to repay \u20ac13 billion in allegedly unfair tax breaks from Ireland. Soon after that order, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called the commission\u2019s case \u201cpolitical crap.\u201d\nEarlier this year, EU antitrust regulators also managed to force Apple to allow third parties use the iPhone\u2019s payment chip to handle transactions, a move that allows banks and other services to compete with the Apple Pay platform.\n--With assistance from Jake Rudnitsky and Peter Elstrom.\n(Updates with Apple shares in 10th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\nThe Stakes Are Sky High for Elon Musk\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with QSR.\nWorking with a range of vendors to produce accessories and parts for Apple devices, the American technological firm intends to invest in a manufacturing plant in Bandung, southeast of Jakarta. This project aims to solve Indonesia's legislation requiring minimum of 40% locally produced components for sold cellphones within the nation.\nCiting non-compliance with local investment criteria, Indonesia banned the sales of Apple's iPhone 16 series last week. Under the same guidelines, Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) too suffered a restriction for its Pixel cellphones.\nApple formally sent a proposal to the Ministry of Industry of Indonesia; this application is now under evaluation.\nIn past initiatives, Apple spent 1.5 trillion rupiah (about $95 million) in Indonesia mostly for the creation of four development academies. This sum, meanwhile, is less than Apple's previous promise of 1.7 trillion rupiah. Though Apple does not have stand-alone factories in Indonesia, instead working with local suppliers, the new investment proposal might enable the corporation to increase its presence in a market with 278 million people.\nThe investment request is supposed to be decided upon by the Ministry of Industry soon.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Super Micro Computer Inc. started the year as a hot artificial intelligence trade. But just eight months after shares hit a record high, investors are asking whether the server maker will be delisted by Nasdaq Inc. and booted from the S&P 500.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nParis Restricts Through Traffic in City Center\nFrom Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow\nIstanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nThe troubled firm \u2014 which has seen shares plummet more than 75% since March \u2014 is due to give a business update on Tuesday after the close. Top of mind is what it says about meeting Nasdaq Inc.\u2019s compliance obligations following the resignation of auditor Ernst & Young LLP last week. The auditor cited concerns about Super Micro\u2019s commitment to integrity and ethics \u2014 a blow that follows a US Department of Justice probe and a damaging short-seller report earlier this year.\nThe stock was up 1.2% midday in New York after reversing an earlier loss. Options data signal that traders see shares moving as much as 20% in either direction after the company\u2019s business update.\nSuper Micro\u2019s listing status was already looking shaky after it failed to file its annual 10-K report by an August deadline. Nasdaq rules give the company until mid-November to submit a plan to restore it to compliance, and if that plan is approved, it could get extra time \u2014 pushing the deadline to February 2025. But the resignation of Ernst & Young makes that more challenging.\n\u201cI think that they probably end up getting delisted just because of the timelines involved,\u201d Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said in an interview. \u201cHow do they get their 10-K out in just a few months when they don\u2019t have an auditor and their last auditor resigned?\u201d\nRepresentatives for Super Micro, Nasdaq and S&P Global, which owns the S&P 500 Index, declined to comment.\nA Nasdaq delisting would be the latest development in a tumultuous year. Super Micro shares were flying high at the start of 2024, with Wall Street enthusiastic about AI-fueled demand for its high-powered data center servers, and the company winning inclusion in the S&P 500. But investors have been bailing as issues pile up, with the 10-K filing delay followed by news that regulators are looking into an ex-employee\u2019s claims that the company sought to overstate its revenue.\nAt the time of Ernst & Young\u2019s resignation, Super Micro said it doesn\u2019t expect the issue to lead to restatements of previously issued financial reports, and that it has begun the process of identifying another auditor.\nStory Continues\nBut some analysts are more wary. \u201cWe now believe there is meaningful risk that prior financial statements may have to be restated once a new public accounting firm is hired,\u201d Needham analysts led by N Quinn Bolton wrote last week, suspending coverage on Super Micro shares.\nA Nasdaq delisting could also trigger removal from the S&P 500 \u2014 leading to forced selling of the shares by institutions, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts led by Woo Jin Ho. He added that about 24% of Super Micro\u2019s shares are held in passive funds, and about 8% are owned by S&P 500-related funds.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Super Micro has been delisted. The company was delisted in 2019 after failing to meet deadlines to file a 10-K and several quarterly reports. It got approval to rejoin in 2020. The same year, Super Micro resolved an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission into its accounting by paying a $17.5 million penalty. Super Micro didn\u2019t admit to or deny the regulator\u2019s allegations as part of its settlement.\nWedbush analyst Bryson noted that the last time Super Micro was delisted, growth stalled for two years. Customers can be spooked by financial issues because it may suggest disruption in the company\u2019s ability to deliver products in a timely way, he added.\nBloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Jin Ho agrees. \u201cWhile any impact on sales won\u2019t be immediate, risks for order cancellations will grow given the rising number of alternative rivals to its still-dominant position in AI servers for data centers,\u201d he wrote.\nDell Technologies Inc. could be a potential beneficiary, he added.\nTech Chart of the Day\nPalantir Technologies Inc. shares are up more than 20% Tuesday after the data-analysis software company reported third-quarter results that beat expectations on \u201cunwavering\u201d AI demand. The company also raised its forecast for operating income in the current period, with analysts noting strong demand for AI applications from enterprise clients.\nTop Tech Stories\nAmazon.com Inc. said it\u2019s committed to building a data center campus adjacent to a Pennsylvania nuclear plant after the top US energy regulator rejected a special deal to power the facility.\nApple Inc. is exploring a push into smart glasses with an internal study of products currently on the market, setting the stage for the company to follow Meta Platforms Inc. into an increasingly popular category.\nApple\u2019s major manufacturing partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. reported its slowest monthly sales growth since February, stoking concerns about demand momentum for both AI infrastructure and iPhones.\nApple has proposed investing almost $10 million to make additional goods in Indonesia, according to people familiar with the matter, as it seeks to have the country\u2019s ban on sales of its latest iPhone removed.\nOpenAI is advancing in its bid to transform the non-profit structure of the $157 billion company into a for-profit business by having preliminary discussions with regulators.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nPremarket\nGartner\nGlobalFoundries\nNovanta\nSequans\nGogo\nConsolidated Comms\nPostmarket\nMicrochip\nSuper Micro Computer\nQualys\nBigbear.ai\nVishay Precision\nFrontier\nLumen Technologies\nVtex\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates stock move, adds options data in second paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\nThe Stakes Are Sky High for Elon Musk\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Here's how each stock performed.\nTesla \u2014 reported on Wednesday 23 October\nElon Musk's Tesla got the group off to a strong start, when it reported its third-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday 23 October.\nWhile the results were mixed, investors cheered the company's beats on earnings per share and higher gross margins, with the stock surging nearly 14.5% in after-hours trading.\nTesla posted revenue of $25.18bn (\u00a319.18bn), which was less than the $25.4bn expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. However, this was higher than the $25.05bn in reported in the second quarter and topped the $23.04bn it posted for the same period last year.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.72, was ahead of an anticipated $0.60, on adjusted net income of $2.5 billion and free cash flow of $2.9bn.\nTesla's closely-watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.\nRead more: IMF upgrades UK growth forecast in budget boost for Rachel Reeves\nIn its earnings deck, Tesla said: \"Preparations remain under way for our offering of new vehicles \u2014 including more affordable models \u2014 which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025.\"\nMusk then said in an earnings call that Tesla's volume growth could be between 20% and 30% next year.\nStory continues\nThese details were welcome news to investors, in light of recent updates that disappointed markets. Tesla recently announced third-quarter deliveries that slightly missed expectations, while the company's highly-anticipated robotaxi event left investors wanting more details.\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said this strong set of results was a \"reminder that, for all its recent challenges, it is one of the few operators to genuinely make the manufacture of electric vehicles pay\".\nHe added: \"The next key test for Tesla is to hit its targeted year-on-year increase in vehicle deliveries for 2024 which will require a pretty sizable acceleration in the remainder of the year.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(TSLA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nAlphabet \u2014 reported on Tuesday 29 October\nGoogle-parent Alphabet smashed expectations with its fiscal third quarter earnings, driving a surge in its shares.\nThe search giant posted earnings per share of $2.12 for the third quarter, which was up 37% on the same period last year and beat forecasts of $1.83, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $88.27bn for the quarter ended 30 September, up 15% on last year and ahead of estimates of $86.44bn.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of the cloud unit in an earnings call on Tuesday, noting that the company's AI portfolio is attracting new customers and leading to larger deals. Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, surpassing expectations.\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the medium and long-term threats at play for Alphabet \u2014 the Department of Justice and AI agents \u2014 these are a very clean set of numbers.\"\nEarlier this month, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it was considering whether to recommend the break up of Google to rein in its dominance in the search engine market.\nThe DOJ said in a court filing that it was considering options, including \"behavioural and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search\".\nThis update came after a landmark ruling in August, in which a US district court said Google had illegally monopolised the online search market.\nRead more: Bitcoin investors eye rally if Trump beats Harris in US election\nIn response to DOJ's latest court filing, Google released a blog post entitled: \"DOJ\u2019s radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\"\n\"With new and improving features with search, Google has a decent future even with the DOJ trying to break it up,\" said Barringer.\n\"YouTube has also been very stable which has allowed the business to focus on the areas it needs to, without worrying about its other core components.\n\u201cInterestingly, the cloud business was growing strongly and should provide a good read across for the rest of the sector.\"\nBarringer said that while innovation was coming through in the business, \"the threats are big and thus the stock will struggle despite good short-term trends. Ultimately, investors await what will happen with the DOJ.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMeta Platforms \u2014 reported on Wednesday 30 October\nMeta disappointed on investor expectations when it shared its guidance for the fourth quarter in its latest results.\nMeta guided to revenue of between $45bn and $48bn for the fourth quarter, with analysts looking for $46.09bn. The company also said it expects capital expenses to grow significantly in 2025.\nWhile this latest set of results weighed on shares, the stock is still up nearly 61% year-to-date.\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said that another area of disappointment for investors in the third quarter figures was daily active users growth on Meta's social media platforms and apps. The company said this figure was up 5% to 3.29 billion individuals in Q3, but this missed the 3.31 billion market forecast.\n\"It\u2019s not simply enough for Meta to move ahead, it needs to stay in the fast lane at all times as far as the market is concerned. Investors typically care about the short term and they want more, more, more,\" he said.\nRead more: Record number of millionaires to leave UK amid tax increase fears\n\u201cEven though Meta owns some of the world\u2019s most popular social media platforms, it still faces significant competition from the likes of TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube. Every minute someone uses a rival platform is a missed opportunity for Meta to generate advertising income,\" he added.\nHowever, it posted beats on earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, earnings per share came in at $6.03, which was ahead of an anticipated $5.25, based on consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $40.5bn for the third quarter, beating forecasts of $40.2bn, as well as rising on last year's figure of $34.1bn.\nCoatsworth said Meta was another company spending big on AI. He highlighted that \"improvements to its AI-driven feed and video recommendations led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year. Meta AI is now helping to improve search functionality on its social media platforms, answering questions and being deployed to edit images.\"\n\"It has further applications such as helping individuals with coding and working as a chatbot,\" he added. \"On top of this, Meta\u2019s Llama large language models are being used by companies and organisations including the US government and the company continues to improve its capabilities.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMicrosoft \u2014 reported on Wednesday 30 October\nAnother tech company that didn't quite match Wall Street's expectations with its latest results was Microsoft, despite also beating forecasts on key financial metrics.\nMicrosoft said commercial revenue which includes cloud services sales, came in at $38.9bn compared to expectations of $38.1bn. The company's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure business, brought in $24.1bn in the quarter, up 20% year over year.\nHowever, Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said that the \"downbeat stock reaction is likely due to guidance given on the call\".\n\"Margins are expected to come under pressure next quarter as the ramp-up in AI spending hits the cost line, and with Azure growth expected at 31-32%, that would mark a slowdown quarter-on-quarter,\" he added.\nRead more: Lloyds profits flat but beat estimates\nEven so, Microsoft still posted earnings per share of $3.30, which were ahead of of analyst forecasts of $3.10, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue of $65.6bn also topped expectations of $64.5bn.\nOne of the latest areas of competition for major technology firms is digital agents powered by AI, with Microsoft jumping into the race last week.\nMicrosoft recently announced the rollout of its Copilot AI features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. These AI tools, known as autonomous agents, are custom-built applications that can handle specific tasks, with the aim of freeing up employees to focus on more strategic work.\nIn full-year results released at the end of June, Microsoft said revenue was up 16% to $245bn, while operating income had risen 24% to $109bn.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Apple AAPL and Dell Technologies DELL.\nIndustry: Micro-Computers\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2363538/2-stocks-to-watch-from-the-challenging-computer-industry\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry participants are suffering from waning demand for consumer PCs. Geopolitical challenges, including persistent inflation and high interest, are major headwinds. Weak demand in China has been a headwind. However, industry participants are benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones.\nIndustry participants like Apple and Dell Technologies are benefiting from these trends. The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for industry participants. The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants. Robust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers.\nIndustry Description\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung.\nExpanding screen size, better display, and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n3 Micro Computer Industry Trends to Watch\nEnterprise Adoption Remains Healthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung.\nStory Continues\nImproved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\nAI-enabled PCs to Boost Demand: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be they Windows or Apple's MacOS-based ones, are expected to benefit from AI infusion. Canalys expects AI-enabled PC shipments to reach 48 million in 2024, representing 18% of total PC shipments. AI-capable PC shipments are projected to surpass 100 million in 2025, which will represent 40% of all PC shipments. This offers significant growth opportunities for industry participants.\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospect\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #210, which places it in the bottom 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\nGiven the dim outlook, there are only a few stocks worth watching in the sector. But before we present those stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.\nThe industry has gained 16.8% over this period compared with the S&P 500's return of 20.5% and the broader sector's growth of 20.5%.\nIndustry's Current Valuation\nOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 26.32X compared with the S&P 500's 21.71X and the sector's 26.13X.\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 32.27X and as low as 16.9X, with the median being 24.9X.\nComputer Stocks to Watch Right Now\nApple: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple currently has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers worldwide, helping it offer appealing new apps that drive the App Store's traffic. A growing number of AI-infused apps will attract subscribers to the App Store.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has decreased by 1.19% to $7.45 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has gained 15.8% in the year-to-date period.\nDell Technologies: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers, driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications.\nIts PowerEdge XE9680L AI-optimized server is very much in demand. Strong enterprise demand for AI-optimized servers is aiding Dell. It is witnessing demand from a diversified customer base that includes higher education institutions, financial services, health care and life services and manufacturing.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been steady at $7.85 per share over the past 30 days. DELL shares have gained 71.1% year to date.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

          "whole_article": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $2.34 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.1%. This estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.38 indicates a change of +12.9% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $127.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.4%. The $419.65 billion and $464.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.3% and +10.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nApple reported revenues of $94.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.1%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.46 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $94.56 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.39%. The EPS surprise was +10.07%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "By Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) -Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said at an all-hands meeting on Tuesday that the plan to require employees to be in-office five days per week is not meant to force attrition or satisfy city leaders, as many employees have suggested.\nThe controversial plan mandating workers come to Amazon offices every day starting next year, up from three days now, has caused consternation among employees who say it is stricter than other tech companies and will hinder efficiency because of commuting times.\nWorkers who are consistently not in compliance have been told they will be \"voluntarily resigning\" and locked out of company computers.\n\"A number of people I've seen theorized that the reason we were doing this is, it's a backdoor layoff, or we made some sort of deal with city or cities,\" said Jassy, according to a transcript of the meeting reviewed by Reuters.\n\"I can tell you both of those are not true. You know, this was not a cost play for us. This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture,\" he said.\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\nLast month Matt Garman, the CEO of cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services, suggested that workers who did not want to comply with the full in-office requirement could leave for another company and said that nine of 10 employees he had spoken with supported the change.\nThat prompted a letter signed by more than 500 Amazon employees imploring Garman to revise the policy, noting the company had operated well fully remote and that the new rule would impact employees with families or medical challenges more than others.\n\"We were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a five-day in-office mandate,\" according to the letter.\nAmazon said in response at the time that it is providing commuter benefits and subsidized parking rates, among other things, to help with its return-to-office policy.\n\"It is an adjustment,\" said Jassy on Tuesday. \"I understand that for a lot of people, and we're going to be working through that adjustment together.\"\nJassy added that an internal system for reporting excess bureaucracy was working well and that out of around 500 emails received, the company had taken action on around 150 of them, without providing detail.\n\"I hate bureaucracy,\" he said. \"One of the reasons I'm still at this company is because it's not a political, bureaucratic place.\"\nAmazon last month reported a record $15.3 billion profit for its third quarter and said it expected a strong holiday quarter. The five-day in-office mandate begins on Jan. 2.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Sandra Maler)\nView Comments"

Following with anticipated spending of $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion are Google and Meta.\nDriven mostly by investments in generative artificial intelligence and huge language models, the predicted expenditure represents a multi-year potential for hyperscale firms.\n\"Continued AI-driven platform-level innovation on Search, YouTube, and with other offerings improves confidence in the durability of long-term growth,\" said Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Brian Nowak, in an investor note regarding Google.\nMeta still gives leaner operations, productivity, and efficiency first priority. \"Importantly, revenue and engagement trends are also improving across Meta's platform,\" Nowak said. \"Our industry and company conversations speak to progress driving incremental Reels engagement and monetization.\"\nMicrosoft keeps expanding public cloud use and artificial intelligence, so it is a leading spender in this area. \"Multiple expansion and positive estimate revisions will come from greater than expected strength in commercial business in coming years,\" Nowak said.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is projected to spend the most on hyperscaler initiatives in 2025. \"Amazon's high-margin businesses continue to allow Amazon to drive greater profitability while still continuing to invest,\" Nowak added. \"Cloud is in a multi-decade secular adoption cycle, Amazon is gaining share in eCommerce/retail and share of consumers' wallets.\"\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nAmazon (AMZN) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 15.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 75% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 28.4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7.1%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8.8%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Amazon have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 6.2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given a notable revision in the company's earnings estimates. While the stock has been gaining lately, the trend might continue since its earnings outlook is still improving.\nThe upward trend in estimate revisions for this online retailer reflects growing optimism of analysts on its earnings prospects, which should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. This insight is at the core of our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank.\nThe five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.\nFor Amazon, strong agreement among the covering analysts in revising earnings estimates upward has resulted in meaningful improvement in consensus estimates for the next quarter and full year.\nCurrent-Quarter Estimate Revisions\nThe earnings estimate of $1.46 per share for the current quarter represents a change of +44.55% from the number reported a year ago.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon has increased 6.16% over the last 30 days, as 11 estimates have gone higher while one has gone lower.\nCurrent-Year Estimate Revisions\nFor the full year, the earnings estimate of $5.07 per share represents a change of +74.83% from the year-ago number.\nThere has been an encouraging trend in estimate revisions for the current year as well. Over the past month, 12 estimates have moved up for Amazon versus one negative revision. This has pushed the consensus estimate 6.23% higher.\nFavorable Zacks Rank\nThanks to promising estimate revisions, Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank is a tried-and-tested rating tool that helps investors effectively harness the power of earnings estimate revisions and make the right investment decision. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nOur research shows that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) significantly outperform the S&P 500.\nBottom Line\nWhile strong estimate revisions for Amazon have attracted decent investments and pushed the stock 8.3% higher over the past four weeks, further upside may still be left in the stock.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. said it\u2019s committed to building a data center campus adjacent to a Pennsylvania nuclear plant after the top US energy regulator rejected a special deal to power the facility.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nParis Restricts Through Traffic in City Center\nFrom Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow\nIstanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nListen to the Here\u2019s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday voted down a request by Talen Energy Corp. that would have increased the amount of power its nuclear plant could supply to an Amazon Web Services data center. Shares of US power producers slumped in response, as investors bet that FERC\u2019s ruling would set back efforts by major technology companies to gain quick access to nuclear energy to power their growing data centers.\n\u201cWe remain committed to continue innovating and advancing carbon-free energy solutions with companies like Talen Energy to power data center operations in the United States and the many technologies supporting our customers and our daily lives,\u201d Duncan Neasham, an Amazon spokesperson, said Monday in an email. Reached by phone, Neasham confirmed the company intends to go forward with the Talen project.\nTalen in March had announced that Amazon\u2019s cloud computing unit would pay $650 million for a data center campus of as much as 960 megawatts adjacent to Talen\u2019s Susquehanna nuclear plant. Talen shares gained as much as 9.8% to $186.64 on Tuesday, after Amazon confirmed its continued support for the project. Amazon\u2019s stock rose about 1%.\nUnder the deal, the data center campus would be powered directly by the plant, meaning Amazon wouldn\u2019t have to plug into the wider grid or fund related transmission upgrades. Some utility owners challenged the move, saying it could threaten grid reliability and raise rates. Talen had previously secured the rights to power the facility with as much as 300 megawatts in that manner. That authorization is unaffected by FERC\u2019s ruling.\nAmazon and other big cloud-computing companies, desperate for power to support their growing operations while pursuing their public goals to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, have sought agreements with operators of nuclear power plants.\n(Updated with shares in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\nThe Stakes Are Sky High for Elon Musk\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) will report later in November.\nThese companies have been capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, leading markets higher.\nRead more: Barclays shares soar to 9-year high as bank posts 23% profit rise\nThe main S&P 500 (^GSPC) index is up 22% so far this year, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) has risen nearly 25% year-to-date.\nLast year, the Magnificent 7 were responsible for more than half of the S&P 500's gain, according to Morgan Stanley.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Given the super high valuations these companies are currently trading at, signs of weakness and numbers which fall short of expectations are likely to spark jolts of volatility and may see positive sentiment seep away.\"\nWill this latest batch of earnings drive these stocks even higher? Here's how each stock performed.\nTesla \u2014 reported on Wednesday 23 October\nElon Musk's Tesla got the group off to a strong start, when it reported its third-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday 23 October.\nWhile the results were mixed, investors cheered the company's beats on earnings per share and higher gross margins, with the stock surging nearly 14.5% in after-hours trading.\nTesla posted revenue of $25.18bn (\u00a319.18bn), which was less than the $25.4bn expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. However, this was higher than the $25.05bn in reported in the second quarter and topped the $23.04bn it posted for the same period last year.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.72, was ahead of an anticipated $0.60, on adjusted net income of $2.5 billion and free cash flow of $2.9bn.\nTesla's closely-watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.\nRead more: IMF upgrades UK growth forecast in budget boost for Rachel Reeves\nIn its earnings deck, Tesla said: \"Preparations remain under way for our offering of new vehicles \u2014 including more affordable models \u2014 which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025.\"\nMusk then said in an earnings call that Tesla's volume growth could be between 20% and 30% next year.\nStory continues\nThese details were welcome news to investors, in light of recent updates that disappointed markets. Tesla recently announced third-quarter deliveries that slightly missed expectations, while the company's highly-anticipated robotaxi event left investors wanting more details.\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said this strong set of results was a \"reminder that, for all its recent challenges, it is one of the few operators to genuinely make the manufacture of electric vehicles pay\".\nHe added: \"The next key test for Tesla is to hit its targeted year-on-year increase in vehicle deliveries for 2024 which will require a pretty sizable acceleration in the remainder of the year.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(TSLA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nAlphabet \u2014 reported on Tuesday 29 October\nGoogle-parent Alphabet smashed expectations with its fiscal third quarter earnings, driving a surge in its shares.\nThe search giant posted earnings per share of $2.12 for the third quarter, which was up 37% on the same period last year and beat forecasts of $1.83, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $88.27bn for the quarter ended 30 September, up 15% on last year and ahead of estimates of $86.44bn.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of the cloud unit in an earnings call on Tuesday, noting that the company's AI portfolio is attracting new customers and leading to larger deals. Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, surpassing expectations.\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the medium and long-term threats at play for Alphabet \u2014 the Department of Justice and AI agents \u2014 these are a very clean set of numbers.\"\nEarlier this month, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it was considering whether to recommend the break up of Google to rein in its dominance in the search engine market.\nThe DOJ said in a court filing that it was considering options, including \"behavioural and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search\".\nThis update came after a landmark ruling in August, in which a US district court said Google had illegally monopolised the online search market.\nRead more: Bitcoin investors eye rally if Trump beats Harris in US election\nIn response to DOJ's latest court filing, Google released a blog post entitled: \"DOJ\u2019s radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\"\n\"With new and improving features with search, Google has a decent future even with the DOJ trying to break it up,\" said Barringer.\n\"YouTube has also been very stable which has allowed the business to focus on the areas it needs to, without worrying about its other core components.\n\u201cInterestingly, the cloud business was growing strongly and should provide a good read across for the rest of the sector.\"\nBarringer said that while innovation was coming through in the business, \"the threats are big and thus the stock will struggle despite good short-term trends. Ultimately, investors await what will happen with the DOJ.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMeta Platforms \u2014 reported on Wednesday 30 October\nMeta disappointed on investor expectations when it shared its guidance for the fourth quarter in its latest results.\nMeta guided to revenue of between $45bn and $48bn for the fourth quarter, with analysts looking for $46.09bn. The company also said it expects capital expenses to grow significantly in 2025.\nWhile this latest set of results weighed on shares, the stock is still up nearly 61% year-to-date.\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said that another area of disappointment for investors in the third quarter figures was daily active users growth on Meta's social media platforms and apps. The company said this figure was up 5% to 3.29 billion individuals in Q3, but this missed the 3.31 billion market forecast.\n\"It\u2019s not simply enough for Meta to move ahead, it needs to stay in the fast lane at all times as far as the market is concerned. Investors typically care about the short term and they want more, more, more,\" he said.\nRead more: Record number of millionaires to leave UK amid tax increase fears\n\u201cEven though Meta owns some of the world\u2019s most popular social media platforms, it still faces significant competition from the likes of TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube. Every minute someone uses a rival platform is a missed opportunity for Meta to generate advertising income,\" he added.\nHowever, it posted beats on earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, earnings per share came in at $6.03, which was ahead of an anticipated $5.25, based on consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $40.5bn for the third quarter, beating forecasts of $40.2bn, as well as rising on last year's figure of $34.1bn.\nCoatsworth said Meta was another company spending big on AI. He highlighted that \"improvements to its AI-driven feed and video recommendations led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year. Meta AI is now helping to improve search functionality on its social media platforms, answering questions and being deployed to edit images.\"\n\"It has further applications such as helping individuals with coding and working as a chatbot,\" he added. \"On top of this, Meta\u2019s Llama large language models are being used by companies and organisations including the US government and the company continues to improve its capabilities.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMicrosoft \u2014 reported on Wednesday 30 October\nAnother tech company that didn't quite match Wall Street's expectations with its latest results was Microsoft, despite also beating forecasts on key financial metrics.\nMicrosoft said commercial revenue which includes cloud services sales, came in at $38.9bn compared to expectations of $38.1bn. The company's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure business, brought in $24.1bn in the quarter, up 20% year over year.\nHowever, Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said that the \"downbeat stock reaction is likely due to guidance given on the call\".\n\"Margins are expected to come under pressure next quarter as the ramp-up in AI spending hits the cost line, and with Azure growth expected at 31-32%, that would mark a slowdown quarter-on-quarter,\" he added.\nRead more: Lloyds profits flat but beat estimates\nEven so, Microsoft still posted earnings per share of $3.30, which were ahead of of analyst forecasts of $3.10, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nShmulik was recently interviewed by Yahoo Finance, where he showed a lot of positives for Amazon's future. Amazon feels like the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about, he said. He highlighted AWS Revenue's increased growth rate as the firm headed towards the fourth quarter and further invested in Prime Video at the right time during the holiday season. He also emphasized the strong and increasing core business to set up a very solid 2025' in terms of free cash flows.\nHowever, while noting that Amazon's appetite for spending will only grow as it gears up for a bumper holiday quarter, Shmulik noted that the e-commerce giant has had good returns on its investments, especially in Prime Video, implying that the company has faith in its spending.\nAmazon's strong operating financials came in the third quarter last year, when net sales were up by 11% to $158.9 billion, higher than WS's predicted $157.2 billion.

This optimism is similarly reflected by Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, which has recently upped its exposure to Amazon, which is considered a growth stock.\nAt this time, Amazon was at $195.78 per share and was up 30.58% for the year, although shares slipped slightly in after-market trading on Monday.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Amazon (AMZN).\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.10, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 50 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.10 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 50 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 46 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 92% and 6% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for AMZN\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs AMZN a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 6.2% over the past month to $5.07.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this online retailer have returned +8.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.46 per share, indicating a change of +44.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.07 points to a change of +74.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +6.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.13 indicates a change of +20.7% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.9%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $186.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $636.32 billion and $705.64 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.7% and +10.9%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $158.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11%. EPS of $1.43 for the same period compares with $0.85 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $157.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.15%. The EPS surprise was +25.44%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "By Florence Loeve and Sudip Kar-Gupta\nPARIS (Reuters) -Investigators searched the offices of U.S. streaming giant Netflix in France and the Netherlands on Tuesday as part of a preliminary investigation into tax fraud laundering, a French judicial source said.\nThe French investigation, carried out by the Parquet National Financier (PNF) - a special financial crime prosecution unit known for pursuing high-stakes white-collar probes that often involve large international companies - was opened in November 2022.\n\"We are cooperating with the authorities in France, where Netflix is a significant contributor to the local economy, and we comply with the tax laws and regulations in all the countries in which we operate,\" a Netflix spokesperson told Reuters.\nInvestigators specialising in financial crime and corruption raided the company's offices in central Paris on Tuesday morning.\nDutch authorities were simultaneously searching the company's European headquarters in Amsterdam, the French judicial source said.\n\"Cooperation between the French and Dutch authorities has been under way for many months as part of these proceedings,\" the French source said. The office of the Dutch prosecutor for financial crime declined to comment and referred questions to the PNF.\nA preliminary investigation in France does not imply criminal charges and does not necessarily lead to a trial.\nIt was not immediately clear what prompted the investigation.\nLarge tech companies offering their online services and subscriptions across borders often run into difficulties with European tax authorities.\nNews website La Lettre reported last year that Netflix's French subsidiary became the subject of scrutiny from tax authorities over its low reported turnover, which the outlet said was at odds with paying user numbers in the country.\nBetween 2019 and 2020, Netflix Services France paid less than 1.0 million euros ($1.09 million) in corporate taxes, by involving a separate unit registered in the Netherlands, La Lettre said, adding the company stopped the practice in 2021.\nCorporate records reviewed by Reuters showed the revenue of Netflix's French unit surged to around 1.2 billion euros in 2021, from 47 million the year before.\nNetflix in France did not respond to a request for comment on the alleged reporting of revenues through Amsterdam rather than France in 2019 and 2020.\nThe PNF declined to give details on the scope of its investigation.\nIn 2022, Netflix agreed to settle a tax dispute with Italy by paying 55.8 million euros.\nStory Continues\nNetflix said on its website it opened its Paris office, located just around the corner from the Opera Garnier, in 2020 and employed around 40 staff.\nThe company produces most of its original films and series, including the global blockbuster Emily in Paris by working with third-party contractors.\n($1 = 0.9149 euros)\n(Additional reporting by Toby Sterling in Amsterdam and Mathieu Rosemain in Paris; Writing by Tassilo Hummel; Editing by Richard Lough, Ed Osmond and Sandra Maler)\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock is up by a considerable 24% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Netflix's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Netflix\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Netflix is:\n34% = US$7.8b \u00f7 US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.34 in profit.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nA Side By Side comparison of Netflix's Earnings Growth And 34% ROE\nFirst thing first, we like that Netflix has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Netflix's exceptional 22% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.\nWe then performed a comparison between Netflix's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 27% in the same 5-year period.\npast-earnings-growth\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for NFLX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\nStory Continues\nIs Netflix Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nGiven that Netflix doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nSummary\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Netflix's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) stock is up 79% over the past 12 months and trading at a premium valuation. Does the streaming giant have another leg higher, or is the rally running out of steam? With the stock up significantly and shares trading at 38 times analysts\u2019 December 2024 earnings estimates, it might seem that shares are running out of juice. However, the company has a secret weapon that it is ready to launch this month and expand as we head into 2025 \u2013 a new in-house ad server.\nI\u2019m bullish on Netflix because of its new in-house ad server, which should allow the company to capitalize on its growing ad-supported tier and make it a more valuable partner for advertisers, unlocking the next phase of the company\u2019s growth.\nAd-Supported Memberships Are Growing\nThings are going well for Netflix. The $324.6 billion company reported strong third-quarter results, growing revenue 15% year-over-year. Meanwhile, it increased operating income by a scorching 52% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, and its operating margin was 30%, up from 22% last year. In addition, ad-supported memberships are becoming a bigger part of the company\u2019s business, as they grew a remarkable 35% quarter-over-quarter.\nAnd Netflix\u2019s new secret weapon is poised to make this ad-supported tier even more lucrative for the company in the months ahead. Netflix\u2019s new ad server will launch in Canada this month and then in additional markets in 2025. Netflix previously relied on Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) ad server, but its new ad server will take advantage of partnerships with Google Live and Trade Desk (TTD).\nWhat Is an Ad Server?\nWhat is an ad server, and why is this important for Netflix? According to Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS), ad servers are \u201cthe technology engines that allow advertisers and publishers to optimize, manage, and distribute ads across a multitude of paid channels,\u201d such as Netflix and YouTube. Netflix\u2019s ad server will allow it to sell advertising slots to potential advertisers who want to advertise to viewers watching Netflix content.\nDigital ads like these are quite valuable to advertisers because they are more targeted and tailored to the specific viewer than traditional broadcast ads. Netflix is very close to the end user and their data, so based on the user\u2019s viewing habits and other data, Netflix\u2019s server may know that they like golf and can serve them ads for new golf clubs or golf apparel, which are more relevant to them than a broader ad for something they are not interested in.\nAs you can imagine, these narrowly-targeted, data-driven ads are also more valuable to the advertisers themselves.\nStory Continues\n\u201cEpisodic\u201d Ads that Tell a Story\nNetflix has also talked about the idea of serving customers \u201cepisodic\u201d ads that tell a story within themselves, which could help to attract attention and maintain interest from viewers. Co-CEO and President Ted Sarandos says that the ad server is a \u201ckey server in unlocking value\u201d in the ad-supported market and that \u201cwhile we\u2019ve got lots of work to do, we are very confident in our ability to execute and grow our ad business much like we did with the paid sharing initiative.\u201d\nUltimately, the proprietary ad server will empower Netflix to deliver more targeted, more valuable ads to its growing number of ad-tier subscribers around the world, powering the next leg up in the company\u2019s growth.\nNetflix\u2019s Valuation\nAs discussed above, Netflix trades at a premium valuation of 38.1 times earnings, but with analysts projecting earnings per share to grow to $23.79 for Fiscal 2025, the company trades at a slightly more inviting valuation of 31.8 times forward earnings, getting a bit closer to the S&P 500\u2019s (SPX) average valuation of 25 times earnings.\nAs the company continues to grow its ad-supported tier and better monetize this segment thanks to its in-house ad server, earnings should continue to grow over time and make this valuation more palatable.\nIs NFLX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nTurning to Wall Street, NFLX earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, 10 Holds, and two Sells assigned in the past three months. The average NFLX stock price target of $786.34 implies 4% upside potential from current levels.\nSee more NFLX analyst ratings\nSmart Score\nWhile Wall Street analysts view Netflix as a Moderate Buy, TipRanks\u2019 proprietary Smart Score system is decidedly bullish. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Netflix boasts an impressive Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 9 out of 10.\nLooking Ahead\nNetflix has been a great growth story for a long time and has gained nearly 80% over the past 12 months. However, the company could still have ample room for growth ahead as it debuts its new ad server in Canada this month and then rolls it out to a larger number of markets in 2025. I\u2019m bullish on Netflix based on the development and rollout of this valuable tool that Sarandos called the \u201ckey to unlocking value\u201d in the ad market.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "It's no secret the overall media and entertainment industry has struggled in recent years, burdened by labor strikes, profitability challenges, and a transition to streaming that's upended some of the most well-known corporate behemoths.\nOne company, though, has thrived amid the various changes: Netflix (NFLX).\nThe streaming platform beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs. The stock is up more than 50% since the start of the year.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCompared to other players, Netflix's subscriber count and profitability stand out.\nThe streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%.\nAnd in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close.\nDisney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks.\n\"Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,\" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance.\nOther analysts have piled onto that thinking, declaring the infamous streaming wars officially over.\n\"Netflix won the streaming wars,\" MoffettNathanson, one of the leading equity research firms for the tech and media sector, said in a note penned by analyst Robert Fishman last week. \"The media space right now is defined by a dichotomy in which Netflix stands as a lone exception.\"\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan agreed, recently telling Yahoo Finance's Market Domination that the company has \"undoubtedly\" secured its No. 1 position.\nHow we got here\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and, most importantly, subscribers.\nThe goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\nStory Continues\nAt the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. \"Bridgerton\" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.\nOthers soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for \"The Office\" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time.\nNetflix CEO Ted Sarandos (C) poses with cast and crew as they arrive for Netflix's \"Bridgerton Season 3\" premiere at Alice Tully Hall on May 13, 2024, in New York City. (ANDREA RENAULT / AFP) \u00b7 ANDREA RENAULT via Getty Images\nBut investors quickly realized that streaming is a tough business. It's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. Case in point: the profit struggles at Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount, among others.\nNetflix, viewed by even its competitors as \"the gold standard\" in streaming, has consistently had the upper hand due to its first-mover advantage as a pure-play streaming company. Its innovative approach to monetization, which includes controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, has also helped boost its positioning.\nAs the market stands today, Netflix's total enterprise value is now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined. It's viewed as a growth stock on Wall Street with full-year revenue expected to climb over 15% year over year.\nAnd as the chart below shows, Netflix's estimated enterprise multiple, which is a ratio used to determine the value of a company after taking into account debt and cash levels, in addition to stock price and cash profitability, comes second only to tech giant Apple. Not too shabby for a pure-play streaming player.\nCatching up to Netflix\nFishman argued in his note that a handful of key assets will be needed for streaming players to not only catch up to Netflix but to survive the industry's massive transition.\nThis includes a scaled streaming service (both in the US and globally), a free advertising video-on-demand (AVOD) platform, top-tier sports rights, a US broadcast network, and film and television studios.\nNot every company will need each one of these assets. But having any can boost a company's respective position within the industry.\nTake Disney (DIS), for example. The media conglomerate checks off every box except a free AVOD platform. But having a scaled streaming service in the US and abroad, like Netflix has, appears to be the formula to success \u2014 at least in the current moment.\n\"That really is, it seems, the end goal,\" Fishman said. \"Whether a company wants that for its own sake (all the traditional players) or to augment sales of toilet paper or cellphones [like Amazon], that is the goal.\"\nThat means joint ventures and other deals like acquisitions will be likely outcomes heading into the back half of the decade.\nParamount (PARA) has already agreed to merge with Skydance Media in a deal that's set to mark an end to the Redstone family's control of the company. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025.\nRegulatory challenges could be an overhang, however. A judge temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), citing antitrust concerns.\nThe Big Tech giants would face similar dealmaking hurdles given their size, while media companies combining with each other would pose their own risk, as nearly all of the top players carry heavy debt loads.\nIn his report, Fishman said Fox and WBD have the most complementary assets for a possible combination, especially since WBD lacks the NFL and most recently lost the NBA. The company is currently tied up in litigation after suing the NBA over the loss of those media rights.\nNetflix has won the streaming wars, but where does that leave everyone else? (Getty Images) \u00b7 SimpleImages via Getty Images\nTo that point, sports has emerged as the final frontier of streaming amid a dying cable TV business. But professional leagues have also been hesitant to fully abandon traditional television.\nThat gives the upper hand to companies with a broadcast network like Fox, Comcast and Disney, in Fishman's view.\n\"While leagues are also increasingly comfortable partnering with streamers, as the NFL Thursday Night Football transition from Fox to Amazon showed, doing so still presents a tradeoff in viewership,\" Fishman pointed out. \"Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners.\"\nAnd as new data shows, companies with exposure to both traditional television and streaming typically capture the most eyeballs.\nDisney's traditional broadcast and streaming properties accounted for a combined 11.3% of overall TV viewing time during the month of September, according to the latest Gauge report from Nielsen.\nGoogle's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Netflix rounded out the top five at 10.6%, 9.3%, 8.2%, and 7.9%, respectively.\nLooking ahead, \"Disney has the right asset mix to establish a true second global streaming service after Netflix,\" Fishman predicted. Disney, which is in the midst of finding its next CEO with Bob Iger's contract set to expire at the end of 2026, will report quarterly earnings on Nov. 14.\nBut he warned the rest of traditional media companies like Comcast, Paramount, and Warner Bros. \"still need to quickly determine which path to take in order to better position themselves within the great streaming game\" \u2014 whether that means a merger, asset sale, acquisition, partnership, or something else altogether.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this internet video service have returned +7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has gained 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nNetflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +99.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.2%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has changed +3.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Roku (ROKU) stock fell more than 17% on Thursday after the company's fourth quarter guidance disappointed, despite the media player reporting its first quarter of $1 billion in revenue.\nFor the current quarter, the company estimated gross profit to hit $465 million, with adjusted EBITDA expected at $30 million. Both metrics fell below Wall Street expectations of $477 million in gross profit and $36.2 million in adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022 USD\n(ROKU)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe company also said it will stop reporting streaming households as a key performance metric, echoing a similar move from streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), which will no longer report subscriber figures at the start of next year.\nInstead, Roku said it will focus on streaming hours, platform revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n\"Since our IPO in 2017, the streaming industry has evolved meaningfully, with Americans now spending significantly more TV time streaming than watching cable,\" Roku said in its earnings release. \"Our business has also grown and evolved, and we are now primarily focused on growing platform revenue and profitability.\"\nPrior to Wednesday's release, shares had rallied more than 30% over the past three months on expectations of a strong ad market and upside to platform revenue growth.\nIt's a critical shift for the company, which underwent a number of cost-cutting measures last year in an effort to bring down operating expenses and improve profits. Roku has recently committed to various monetization initiatives, which have included a deeper integration with programmatic advertising giant the Trade Desk (TTD).\nRoku said those efforts, along with tailwinds from political ad spend, will \"continue in Q4.\"\nA Roku logo is seen on a screen with a silhouette of a hand holding a tv remote. (Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) \u00b7 SOPA Images via Getty Images\nIn the third quarter, Roku reported net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 16% year over year, with a net loss of $65 million, or $0.06 a share. That quarterly net loss was significantly narrower than the $0.33 loss Wall Street expected, as well as the prior-year period's $2.33 quarterly loss.\nPlatform revenue, which includes ad sales, revenue from distribution deals, and the over-the-top streaming service, the Roku Channel, came in at $908 million, up 15% on the year.\nThe boom was driven by strength in advertising sales, content distribution, and expansion into international markets.\n\"In Q3, the year-over-year growth of advertising activities across the Roku platform \u2014 excluding media and entertainment \u2014 outperformed both the overall ad market and the over-the-top (OTT) ad market in the US,\" Roku said, highlighting strength in political, retail, and consumer packaged goods ad verticals.\nStory Continues\nThe company reported 85.5 million streaming households, a sequential increase of 2 million and up 13% year over year. Streaming hours also increased 5.3 billion year over year to reach 32 billion in the quarter.\nOverall, the company has been facing more competition in the connected TV and streaming ads business.\nAmazon (AMZN) rolled out ads on its Prime Video streaming service earlier this year in the US. Wall Street has noted the massive disruption the tech giant has already caused in the space as companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) are also in the running for ad buyers.\nOn Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne reiterated his Underweight rating on shares, categorizing recent optimism as \"premature\" and rising competition \"as an under-appreciated risk.\"\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Outdoor Brands, Inc. AOUT, Crocs, Inc. CROX, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Mattel, Inc. MAT.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n5 Discretionary Stocks to Buy as Consumer Confidence Hits 9-Month High\nU.S. consumers are much more confident now than they were last month. A jumbo rate cut announced last month by the Federal Reserve, coupled with optimism surrounding more interest rate cuts in the coming months, have made consumers confident about the economy's health.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in discretionary stocks such as American Outdoor Brands, Inc., Crocs, Inc., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Netflix, Inc. and Mattel, Inc.. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nConsumer Confidence Soars\nThe Conference Board said on Tuesday that the consumer confidence index surged to 108.7 in October, from 99.2 in the previous month, to hit its highest level in nine months.\nThe Present Situation Index, a measure of consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, jumped 14.2 points to reach 138. The Expectations Index, a measure of consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market situation, rose 6.3 points to 89.1. This was comfortably above the threshold of 80. Any reading below 80 indicates impending recession.\nThe jump in consumer confidence comes after ebbing drastically in September on fears of a slowing economy. Interestingly, consumer confidence remained high in October despite data suggesting a cooling job market.\nThe Labor Department said on Tuesday that job openings fell to a three-and-a-half-year low in September. Despite the decline, the Conference Board's survey showed that consumers' perceptions of the jobs market improved in October, which boosted their confidence.\nMore Rate Cut Hopes Boost Consumer Confidence\nFears gripped markets earlier this month after fresh data showed a slight uptick in monthly inflation in September. This raised concerns over the economy's health, turning markets volatile.\nHowever, consumers are hoping that inflation will still be on track to reach the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, its first rate cut since March 2020.\nStory Continues\nThe Federal Reserve has also hinted that more rate cuts are on the horizon if inflation continues to ease substantially. The CME FedWatch tool presently shows a 98.9% possibility of a 25-basis point cut in November and a 76.6% probability of a 20-basis point cut in December. Lower borrowing rates typically benefit growth stocks like tech and consumer discretionary.\n4 Discretionary Stocks With Upside\nAmerican Outdoor Brands\nAmerican Outdoor Brands, Inc. is a provider of outdoor products and accessories, including hunting, fishing, camping, shooting and personal security and defense products, for rugged outdoor enthusiasts. AOUT produces products under the brands Caldwell; Crimson Trace; Wheeler; Tipton; Frankford Arsenal; Lockdown; BOG; Hooyman; Smith & Wesson Accessories; M&P Accessories; Thompson/Center Arms Accessories; Performance Center Accessories; Schrade; Old Timer; Uncle Henry; Imperial; BUBBA; UST; LaserLyte; and MEAT!.\nAmerican Outdoor Brands' expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 59.4%.

NCLH presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\nNetflix, Inc.\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\nNetflix's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 64.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 3.7% over the past 60 days.

Microsoft Corp., which Nvidia passed last month, has a market cap of $3.06 trillion. Nvidia has soared more than 850% since the end of 2022.\n\u201cOver the past several quarters, it has felt like people basically care about inflation numbers, job numbers, and Nvidia numbers,\u201d said Fall Ainina, director of research at James Investment Research. \u201cNvidia overtaking Apple in market cap not only conveys that it is the biggest beneficiary of the AI infrastructure cycle, but it suggests people expect the AI boom will continue.\u201d\nThe chipmaker accounts for 7% of the weight of the S&P 500 Index and is responsible for about a quarter of the benchmark\u2019s 21% gain this year. Nvidia previously closed with the title of largest company in June, although it only held the record for a day.\nThe biggest companies on Wall Street are all heavily exposed to artificial intelligence: Apple with its newly launched AI iPhones; Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc. with their cloud businesses and AI services; and Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s AI features and ad targeting. With the exception of Apple, these companies are all among Nvidia\u2019s largest customers, and they have stressed their commitment to continuing to spend on AI.\nLast week, Apple\u2019s results underlined concerns about its revenue growth, along with weakness in China. Nvidia will report later this month.\nNot only are the biggest companies by market cap AI plays, but so are the year\u2019s top stock performers. Nvidia\u2019s 183% advance is the third-largest in the S&P 500 this year, behind Vistra Corp. \u2014 the power producer that has seen a surge in demand related to AI \u2014 and data-analysis software firm Palantir Technologies Inc.\nRecent strength has come as the company calmed investor concerns about issues involving its Blackwell chip, which was delayed due to engineering snags, as well as its long-term growth prospects.\nAnalysts expect Nvidia\u2019s revenue to more than double in its current fiscal year and rise another 44% during the following, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wall Street analysts have continually raised estimates for Nvidia\u2019s earnings and profit over the past quarter.\nStory Continues\nBeyond the Blackwell optimism, recent sales from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. showed strong AI demand, while a funding round for OpenAI resulted in a $157 billion valuation. OpenAI recently released an AI model with reasoning capabilities, something Alphabet Inc. is also working on.\n\u201cThe implication of AI is extraordinarily large, and these big tech companies are investing hundreds of billions into it, with Nvidia benefiting the most,\u201d said James Investment\u2019s Ainina. \u201cOverall there continues to be a good picture for its prospects.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\nThe Stakes Are Sky High for Elon Musk\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Vice President Kamala Harris made an Election Day push to win over swing-state voters while former President Donald Trump said there would be no violence from his supporters, as Americans streamed to the polls to cast their ballots in one of the tightest races in modern US history.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nParis Restricts Through Traffic in City Center\nFrom Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow\nIstanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers\nIn Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround\nAnxiety about the outcome of the race \u2014 and when the winner will be known \u2014 hung over Election Day with at least 83 million people having voted early. Long lines were reported at polling stations in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania but otherwise voting appeared to be going smoothly so far.\nHarris, who is looking to become the first woman to lead the US, did interviews on drive-time radio in battleground states. She told an Atlanta station that her focus for Black men \u201cranges from access to capital to what we need to do for health care, what we need to do for our fathers and our young fathers.\u201d\nListen and follow The Big Take on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts\nIn earlier speeches, the vice president branded Trump a threat to democracy and pledged to protect reproductive freedoms and lower prices for housing and health care. Yet she struggled to define herself in one of the shortest presidential campaigns, after Joe Biden stepped aside in July.\nTrump is hoping to capitalize on surveys that widely show Americans trust his ability to steward the economy. He\u2019s vowed to crack down on immigration, promising to deport millions of undocumented migrants and slash taxes. He\u2019s also cast his political opponents as the \u201cenemy from within\u201d \u2014 a dark vision that was fueled by a sense of threat after a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet grazed his right ear at a July rally.\nA victory would mark an extraordinary political comeback for Trump, who left office in 2021 weeks after a mob of his supporters attacked the US Capitol to reverse his electoral loss. He regained the support of Republicans, some of whom had abandoned him after the Jan. 6 Capitol assault. He was found guilty earlier this year on 34 felony counts linked to a payment to an adult film actress before the 2016 election.\n\u201cI may regret that statement, but I\u2019m hearing we\u2019re doing very well,\u201d Trump told reporters after he voted in Palm Beach, Florida. Addressing concerns of civil unrest once the results are known, Trump said there would be no violence.\nStory Continues\n\u2018My supporters are not violent people,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want any violence.\u201d\nAfter refusing to concede the 2020 election and earlier accusing Democrats of trying to steal this year\u2019s vote, Trump struck a more slightly more conciliatory tone Tuesday. \u201cIf I lose an election \u2014 a fair election \u2014 I\u2019ll be the first one to acknowledge it,\u201d he said.\nUS stocks stayed higher Tuesday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 rose more than 1%, fueled by gains in Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. Treasuries pared some of their earlier losses after a $42 billion auction of 10-year notes drew good demand.\nTrump planned to hold his election night rally at the convention center in Palm Beach. Harris, who is registered to vote in California, cast her ballot by mail. Her rally was planned for Washington\u2019s Howard University, her alma mater.\nThe two candidates offered opposite visions of how to lead in what\u2019s set to become the costliest campaign in US history. Trump promised an amplified version of his playbook-shredding first term, with its emphasis on \u201cAmerica First.\u201d Some of his former White House aides have questioned his fitness for a second term, including his one-time chief of staff John Kelly, who said in the final weeks of the campaign that Trump was a \u201cfascist.\u201d\nHarris ran a cautious campaign that saw her reintroduce herself to voters after her 2020 election run. She sought to distinguish herself from Biden without criticizing the president who endorsed her to replace him. Harris has espoused a similar foreign policy doctrine to Biden, who corralled support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia. She\u2019s also navigated intra-party angst over Israel\u2019s war against Hamas.\n\u201cHe\u2019s way out there in another world and if he gets selected, it\u2019s going to be a disaster,\u201d Steve Wyche, 65, said after voting in Roswell, Georgia. A longtime Republican, Wyche said he voted for Harris rather than Trump because \u201cI just want him to go away.\u201d\nWhile Biden emphasized democracy in his campaign against Trump, Harris leaned on freedom as a way to encompass democracy, women\u2019s reproductive rights and civil rights. She\u2019s promised to expand the child tax credit and make housing more affordable.\nWith the Republican ticket still refusing to concede that Biden won last time, anxiety is running high over the potential for a drawn-out battle and when the next president will be known. Trump made little secret of his party\u2019s plan for legal challenges should Harris win.\nIn Las Vegas, many voters cast ballots at Allegiant Stadium. Ian Stumbaugh, 46, said securing the border was his top priority followed by the economy, and he voted for Trump.\nThis is \u201can election that we definitely want to be a part of,\u201d said Stumbaugh. He said he used to live in California. \u201cMy vote didn\u2019t matter over there,\u201d he said.\nThere are also 67.2 million voters who requested mail-in ballots that they haven\u2019t yet returned. In most states, voters must return those ballots by the time polls close or cast a vote in person \u2014 although 18 states will count mail-in ballots as long as they\u2019re postmarked by Election Day.\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher globally. The election winner will inherit the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and must face down an increasingly assertive China. The night before Election Day, US intelligence agencies issued an unprecedented statement saying adversaries \u2014 with Russia as the \u201cmost active threat\u201d \u2014 were stepping up a push to undermine confidence in the elections.\nThere were worrying developments in the waning days of the race when early-voting boxes in Oregon and Washington were set on fire, destroying hundreds of ballots. On Tuesday, the FBI said non-credible bomb threats that appeared to have originated from Russia had been received at polling locations in several states.\nVoters also voiced fears about misinformation \u2014 which were borne out by recent deep-fakes of Harris\u2019 running mate Tim Walz.\nIt was a campaign of unprecedented vitriol. The candidates \u2014 and their vice presidential picks, Walz and Republican JD Vance \u2014 spurred supporters on with dark warnings about their rivals winning control of the White House.\nTrump cast America as a \u201cgarbage can for the world,\u201d a weak nation unable to outfox its rivals and buckling under the weight of undocumented immigrants. At a rally in New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden, a comedian opening for the former president called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d while another speaker referred to Harris\u2019 \u201cpimp handlers.\u201d\nYet Vance made a plea for unity after he voted in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\u201cThe best way to heal the rift in the country is to try to govern the country as well as we can create as much prosperity as we can for the American people, and remind our fellow Americans that we are all fundamentally on the same team,\u201d Vance said.\n--With assistance from Gregory Korte, Stephanie Lai, Ted Mann, Michael Sasso and Mark Niquette.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEven Some High-Income Americans Can\u2019t Afford New Cars Anymore\nAn Immigrant Workforce Thrives in Georgia\u2019s MAGA Heartland\nExpect This Election to Play Differently than 2020 on Social Media\nAt Business Schools, More Women Are Getting MBAs\nThe Stakes Are Sky High for Elon Musk\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "ETFs that use option strategies to generate exceptionally high yields have gained immense popularity in recent years. Some of these ETFs trade options on single stocks, boasting yields of 100%, 200%, or even higher, which generate a lot of buzz on social media.\nHowever, these ETFs generally underperform compared to their underlying stocks, even as they continue to attract assets from investors drawn to the lucrative monthly distributions. Let\u2019s examine how these strategies work and why they may not be suitable for long-term investors.\nDistribution Yield Calculation\nThe YieldMax SMCI Option Income Strategy ETF SMCY currently boasts a yield of 232%. This yield is calculated by multiplying the recent monthly payout by 12 and dividing it by the fund\u2019s most recent NAV.\nThe yields can vary significantly month-to-month, as the income from selling options fluctuates with changes in the underlying stock\u2019s movement, implied volatility, and other factors.\nThe extreme volatility and recent decline in SMCI SMCI\u00a0 stock explain this unusually high current yield, but the same yield may not be achievable in the future.\nThe YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF MSTY currently reports a yield of 202%, driven in part by significant volatility in MicroStrategy MSTR stock.\nHow the Strategy Works\nThese funds hold both long and short positions in call and put options, along with Treasury bonds as collateral. The principal strategy is to obtain synthetic exposure to the underlying security, which requires less capital.\nTo generate monthly income, the fund manager sells call options and, in some cases, credit call spreads to enhance yields.\nFund Performance vs. Underlying Stock\nThe best-performing YieldMax product, the NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF NVDY, has generated a total return of about 200% since its inception in May 2023. However, NVIDIA NVDA stock itself has risen approximately 374% over the same period. Despite this underperformance, the fund has attracted $1.3 billion in assets.\nAnother popular fund, the TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF TSLY, has remained nearly flat since its launch in November 2022, underperforming Tesla\u2019s TSLA 36% gain in that period.\nBottom Line\nIt\u2019s essential for investors to understand how these funds operate and what to expect from these strategies. Fund managers have done a commendable job explaining their strategies, so please educate yourself thoroughly before investing.\nTo learn more, please watch the short video above.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Instead, many have found another way to make better strides in the AI market besides investing in semiconductor big leagues and Wall Street sweetheart NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\u00a0 Nvidia has been a major winner, but is flat since June, and its hot streak could be ending. However, there are other ways to profit off the AI boon.\nRobotic stocks have for quite some time been gaining major traction on the stock market as new developments are helping leading companies break into this pocket of the tech sector. Robotic stocks and their respective companies are involved in various operations, working as cross-functional solutions in a mirage of industries.\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nFrom healthcare, autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and renewable energy infrastructure, robotic systems are building a compelling case for the future developments of artificial technology and digital equipment.\nFor some investors, this could be the switch-up their portfolios need amid a wider market shift. Future forecasts expect spending on robotic systems development to reach stratospheric levels, as competition in the industry increases and new automation developments, in collaboration with artificial intelligence, breaks ground.\nThis year alone the AI robotics market has grown by 30%, compared to 2023. Experts expect that the market will see a nearly 20% annual growth until 2030. With growing potential, now might be a pleasant time for investors to get a head start on the robotics industry.\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc.\nFirst on the list is the all-American biotechnology company, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). The Sunnyvale, California-based company develops, markets, and distributes robotic systems used in healthcare, which in turn helps to improve clinical patient outcomes.\nIntuitive Surgical is best known for its development of the da Vinci Surgical System, a highly sophisticated robotic system that allows surgeons to perform and complete minimally invasive procedures. In the last earrings quarter, the company reported that global da Vinci procedures had increased by 17% compared to the same period last year. Across the world, the company has installed a base of 9,203 da Vinci systems.\nIn addition to this, third quarter earnings results showed that the company had experienced another strong quarterly performance, with revenue of $2.04 billion up 16.88% quarter-over-quarter, and net income of $565.10 million rose 35.94% compared to the previous quarter. Globally, da Vinci procedures increased 18% compared to Q3 2023, while revenue across most product and service categories grew during the quarter.\nStory Continues\nThe positive quarterly results helped push share prices further north, with ISRG gaining over 10% in post quarterly earnings trading. Shares have gained 56% year to date, which is double the year-to-date performance of the bench S&P 500 which is up 22.98% since the turn of the year through October 30.\nThe company has plenty to gain from developments on the AI front. Adoption of minimally invasive surgeries is becoming a growing trend across much of the world. Not only this, but self-automated home-based care is making a mark on the industry, which could help place Intuitive at the forefront.\nThere are however some aspects that could impact top-line growth. For starters, Intuitive might face off with rising competition in the market, as new startups are rushing to jump on the AI-robotics bandwagon. Next to this, slower adoption in key regions in Asia could hamper near-term growth and further slow down the rollout of systems.\nZebra Technologies Corp.\nNext up is Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) which manufactures and sells tracking, marking, and computer printing technologies. Despite a surge in online media taking the internet by storm, traditional legacy printing systems are still relevant, however, Zebra is entirely changing the game.\nThe company develops digital products that are used in computers and other electronic devices such as tablets. Additional software systems, also created by Zebra Technologies can help businesses create and print thermal barcode labels, and provide autonomous mobile robotic functionality for industrial hardware and software.\nZebra has been pacing the year on a solid footing, with shares of the company rising a robust 43.55% year to date. On the back of growing optimism regarding the future of artificial technology, ZBRA recently climbed to a 52-week high at $384.68.\nA closer look at the third quarter earnings results showed that the company has remained in a positive territory. For one, revenue of $1.22 billion increased 0.25% during the period, while the company reported $1.25 billion in net sales which represented a year-over-year improvement of 31.3%.\nAdditionally, the company reported $137 million in net income and net income per diluted share of $2.64. Zebra has been making some structural and expense changes in recent months, as they look to build a more robust financial foundation, while increasing revenue margins.\nThough revenue growth has been slower, the company has undertaken a restructuring approach in recent months in an attempt to bolster cash flow and improve net expense savings. In Q3, Zebra reported $120 million in annualized net expense savings, which is currently within the company\u2019s benchmark. In total, the company expects to book $60 million in incremental savings for the full year 2024 and free cash flow of $700 million.\nOn a positive note, Zebra could benefit from improved product demand within the enterprise sector. Demand in e-commerce could also help bolster performance, as mobile computing becomes increasingly important in a sector that\u2019s moving away from legacy systems, and instead seeking to leverage autonomous tools.\nPTC Inc\nLast on the list is the Boston-based computer software and services company, PTC Inc (NASDAQ:PTC). The company has a long track record of developing and distributing parametric and associative technologies which has largely been used in designing and modeling software.\nIn more recent years, the company has shifted focus towards the various services embedded within the Internet of Things (IoT) including augmented reality (AR). Competition in these arenas has steadily been growing, which has seen the company rapidly adapt to a changing consumer and commercial market.\nPerformance of PTC shares have been all over the board this year, and zig-zagging across the market. Shares started the year on a strong note adding approximately 11% within the first three weeks of January. From there on out, performance was largely up and down, with shares peaking near the end of March before slipping back down again.\nOverall, year-to-date performance has remained steady, with shares adding nearly 12.29% since the beginning of 2024. Impressively, shares have regained their footing after a massive sell-off that brushed over much of the tech industry during the opening days of September. Shares were down 8.00% before making a strong rebound, and have gained 14.92% since the decline.\nFinancials are reflecting steady performance, however year over year revenue on a constant currency basis had declined 3%. In total, the company reported $518.64 million in revenue for the third quarter, which was slightly down compared to the reported $542.00 million in the same quarter last year.\nStill, on a positive note, the company reported that guidance of 11%-12% constant currency growth remains on track and PTC continues to maintain free cash flow guidance for the full year 2024. Though there have been some difficulties throughout the year, PTC is expected to see improved financial performance in the coming months, as current delivery remains within full-year guidance.\nPTC is currently on a \u201cHold\u201d basis, according to Zacks Rankings. Looking forward, this could change again, however, sentiment might suggest that investors should consider buying while prices are in a swing state and leverage a possible low-hanging fruit.\nClosing Thoughts\nThere has been a lot of activity shaping the robotics market, and plenty of new developments are creating exciting opportunities for investors who were late to the party. Perhaps the collaboration between artificial intelligence could give robotics a more prominent boost and help bring these companies into the spotlight.\nAs momentum continues to pick up, perhaps the coming months will present investors with a more attractive approach that can help them shift their opinion over the robotics industry. Picking the right companies will be crucial, as not everyone will be winners. However, for the lucky few, this could be a turning point that could help pivot the industry.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "The astonishing rally in U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. The prime factor was the unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology worldwide.\nLately, a section of market analysts and financial researchers have raised concerns about the potential profitability of massive investments in generative AI by several technology giants. We believe that AI applications will continue to gather pace in the coming years, buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet.\nAt this stage, we recommend three technology behemoths with extensive applications of generative AI. These companies are - Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nBuy 3 Tech Giants With Extensive AI Applications\nThese three companies have beaten their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom lines in third-quarter 2024. These stocks have solid price upside potential in the short term.\nIn the long term, these stocks have a higher earnings per share (EPS) growth rate than the broad-market S&P 500 index, which should drive their stock prices in the next 3 to 5 years. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nAlphabet Inc.\nA deepening focus on generative AI technology is a major positive for GOOGL in this data-driven world. Google has been well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\nAlphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI (Gen AI) solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products. GOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance the search results continue to boost traffic on GOOGL\u2019s search engine.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nStory Continues\nIn addition, GOOGL\u2019s Vertex AI enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models. These generative AI capabilities are aiding GOOGL in enhancing search results, accelerating Android development, boosting healthcare reach and delivering enhanced cloud experience.\nExcellent Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 21.6% from the last closing price of $169.24. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$235. This indicates a maximum upside of 38.9% and no downside.\nAlphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12% and 11.4%, respectively, for 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 2.8% in the last seven days. GOOGL currently has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 17.6%, higher than the S&P 500\u2019s long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAdobe Inc.\nAdobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster.\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\nThese services help businesses streamline marketing and products for targeted consumer groups, including chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers.\nAdobe is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products. ADBE\u2019s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are driving top-line growth. The major positives are rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps.\nGrowth in emerging markets and robust online video creation demand remain tailwinds. Additionally, solid demand for Adobe\u2019s commerce offerings and the growing adoption of Acrobat are encouraging. Adobe\u2019s strong market position, compelling product lines and continued innovation remain positive.\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\nRobust Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 26.2% from the last closing price of $481.35. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703. This indicates a maximum upside of 46% and a maximum downside of 8.6%.\nAdobe has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.9% and 12.4%, respectively, for next year (ending November 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.2% in the last 60 days. ADBE currently has a long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%, in line with the S&P 500.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBroadcom Inc.\nBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers. AVGO\u2019s solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers.\nThe acquisition of VMware has benefited the Infrastructure software solutions of Broadcom. VMware\u2019s expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy. AVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\nSolid Price Upside Potential for AVGO Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.9% from the last closing price of $168.55. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $150-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 42.4% and a maximum downside of 18.6%.\nBroadcom has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 16.7% and 27.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2025 (ending October 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.4% in the last 60 days. AVGO currently has a long-term EPS growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500\u2019s long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, this was higher than the $25.05bn in reported in the second quarter and topped the $23.04bn it posted for the same period last year.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.72, was ahead of an anticipated $0.60, on adjusted net income of $2.5 billion and free cash flow of $2.9bn.\nTesla's closely-watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.\nRead more: IMF upgrades UK growth forecast in budget boost for Rachel Reeves\nIn its earnings deck, Tesla said: \"Preparations remain under way for our offering of new vehicles \u2014 including more affordable models \u2014 which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025.\"\nMusk then said in an earnings call that Tesla's volume growth could be between 20% and 30% next year.\nStory continues\nThese details were welcome news to investors, in light of recent updates that disappointed markets. Tesla recently announced third-quarter deliveries that slightly missed expectations, while the company's highly-anticipated robotaxi event left investors wanting more details.\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said this strong set of results was a \"reminder that, for all its recent challenges, it is one of the few operators to genuinely make the manufacture of electric vehicles pay\".\nHe added: \"The next key test for Tesla is to hit its targeted year-on-year increase in vehicle deliveries for 2024 which will require a pretty sizable acceleration in the remainder of the year.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(TSLA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nAlphabet \u2014 reported on Tuesday 29 October\nGoogle-parent Alphabet smashed expectations with its fiscal third quarter earnings, driving a surge in its shares.\nThe search giant posted earnings per share of $2.12 for the third quarter, which was up 37% on the same period last year and beat forecasts of $1.83, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $88.27bn for the quarter ended 30 September, up 15% on last year and ahead of estimates of $86.44bn.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of the cloud unit in an earnings call on Tuesday, noting that the company's AI portfolio is attracting new customers and leading to larger deals. Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, surpassing expectations.\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the medium and long-term threats at play for Alphabet \u2014 the Department of Justice and AI agents \u2014 these are a very clean set of numbers.\"\nEarlier this month, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it was considering whether to recommend the break up of Google to rein in its dominance in the search engine market.\nThe DOJ said in a court filing that it was considering options, including \"behavioural and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search\".\nThis update came after a landmark ruling in August, in which a US district court said Google had illegally monopolised the online search market.\nRead more: Bitcoin investors eye rally if Trump beats Harris in US election\nIn response to DOJ's latest court filing, Google released a blog post entitled: \"DOJ\u2019s radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\"\n\"With new and improving features with search, Google has a decent future even with the DOJ trying to break it up,\" said Barringer.\n\"YouTube has also been very stable which has allowed the business to focus on the areas it needs to, without worrying about its other core components.\n\u201cInterestingly, the cloud business was growing strongly and should provide a good read across for the rest of the sector.\"\nBarringer said that while innovation was coming through in the business, \"the threats are big and thus the stock will struggle despite good short-term trends.

The company also said it expects capital expenses to grow significantly in 2025.\nWhile this latest set of results weighed on shares, the stock is still up nearly 61% year-to-date.\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said that another area of disappointment for investors in the third quarter figures was daily active users growth on Meta's social media platforms and apps. The company said this figure was up 5% to 3.29 billion individuals in Q3, but this missed the 3.31 billion market forecast.\n\"It\u2019s not simply enough for Meta to move ahead, it needs to stay in the fast lane at all times as far as the market is concerned. Investors typically care about the short term and they want more, more, more,\" he said.\nRead more: Record number of millionaires to leave UK amid tax increase fears\n\u201cEven though Meta owns some of the world\u2019s most popular social media platforms, it still faces significant competition from the likes of TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube.

For the third quarter, earnings per share came in at $6.03, which was ahead of an anticipated $5.25, based on consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $40.5bn for the third quarter, beating forecasts of $40.2bn, as well as rising on last year's figure of $34.1bn.\nCoatsworth said Meta was another company spending big on AI. He highlighted that \"improvements to its AI-driven feed and video recommendations led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year. Meta AI is now helping to improve search functionality on its social media platforms, answering questions and being deployed to edit images.\"\n\"It has further applications such as helping individuals with coding and working as a chatbot,\" he added. \"On top of this, Meta\u2019s Llama large language models are being used by companies and organisations including the US government and the company continues to improve its capabilities.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMicrosoft \u2014 reported on Wednesday 30 October\nAnother tech company that didn't quite match Wall Street's expectations with its latest results was Microsoft, despite also beating forecasts on key financial metrics.\nMicrosoft said commercial revenue which includes cloud services sales, came in at $38.9bn compared to expectations of $38.1bn. The company's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure business, brought in $24.1bn in the quarter, up 20% year over year.\nHowever, Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said that the \"downbeat stock reaction is likely due to guidance given on the call\".\n\"Margins are expected to come under pressure next quarter as the ramp-up in AI spending hits the cost line, and with Azure growth expected at 31-32%, that would mark a slowdown quarter-on-quarter,\" he added.\nRead more: Lloyds profits flat but beat estimates\nEven so, Microsoft still posted earnings per share of $3.30, which were ahead of of analyst forecasts of $3.10, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue of $65.6bn also topped expectations of $64.5bn.\nOne of the latest areas of competition for major technology firms is digital agents powered by AI, with Microsoft jumping into the race last week.\nMicrosoft recently announced the rollout of its Copilot AI features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. These AI tools, known as autonomous agents, are custom-built applications that can handle specific tasks, with the aim of freeing up employees to focus on more strategic work.\nIn full-year results released at the end of June, Microsoft said revenue was up 16% to $245bn, while operating income had risen 24% to $109bn. In addition, net income had grown 22% to $88bn.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView quote details\nAmazon \u2014 reported on Thursday 31 October\nE-commerce giant Amazon posted stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than expected on Wall Street.\nAmazon reported earnings per share of $1.43, which was ahead of estimates of $1.16, while revenue came in at $158.9bn against forecasts of $157.29.\nThe company also said it expected revenue in the range of $181.5bn to $188.5bn in the fourth quarter, versus analyst forecasts of $186.36bn.\nIn terms of operating income, Amazon said it expected this be between $16bn and $20bn in final quarter of the year, compared with estimates of $17.49bn.\nShares popped on the back of this latest earnings release, up 31% year-to-date.\nRead more: The best stocks to buy in the UK, according to Barclays\nMamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Amazon's \"online sales and international growth both proved strong, while AWS remained steady.

Google, a unit of Alphabet, did not immediately respond to similar requests.\nFreeman said May could try to refile her lawsuit, but dismissed a claim seeking triple damages for good. Alphabet is based in Mountain View, California.\nIn 2023, Americans lost $217 million in gift card or reload card fraud, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe actual amount is likely much higher because the data cover only reported cases. Citing FTC data from 2021, May said Google Play cards account for about 20% of gift card scams.\nThe case is May v Google LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 24-01314.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)\nView Comments"

However, the true highlight of the report was Google Cloud, which not only recorded a notable acceleration in revenue growth but also saw substantial operating income gains. Yet, Alphabet\u2019s valuation doesn\u2019t seem to fully reflect its ongoing momentum. For this reason, I remain invested in Alphabet, confident about the potential for upside in the stock.\nGoogle Search and YouTube Keep Dominating\nAlphabet\u2019s core revenue segments, Google Search and YouTube, once again posted solid numbers in Q3, reinforcing the company\u2019s position as a digital advertising and search leader. Although I hear concerns from investors and analysts about Alphabet\u2019s lagging position in the large language model (LLM) search arena, the company continues to attract increasing advertising revenue.\nSpecifically, Google Search saw a 12% revenue increase year-over-year, with management citing growing user engagement fueled by recent AI tools like AI Overviews and Circle to Search. AI Overviews has now been rolled out to over a billion users worldwide, enabling more complex queries and expanding how people interact with Search. Circle to Search, another AI feature that lets users draw a circle around an object in an image to search for similar items directly, is now active on over 150 million Android devices.\nThe Circle to Search feature has been quite popular. Management reported that one-third of those who have tried it are now using it weekly, which translates to a strong indicator of its value .\nMeanwhile, YouTube recorded a 12% growth in ad revenue, driven by brand and direct-response ads. The platform\u2019s progress in creating a more TV-like experience, including features like multiview, has definitely boosted its appeal, particularly in the living room space. Shorts is also doing really well, with monetization getting stronger again this quarter. It\u2019s interesting to see how quickly it\u2019s catching up to the in-stream video, especially in the U.S. and other high-ad revenue markets. Notably, 70% of channels uploading to YouTube each month post Shorts, helping Alphabet pull in even more ad dollars.\nGoogle Cloud Impresses with Accelerated Growth and Profitability\nBeyond Alphabet\u2019s core segments performing well, the real standout in Q3 was Google Cloud, a major driver of my bullish outlook on the stock. The segment saw its revenue surge by 35% year-over-year, accelerating from the prior quarter\u2019s 29% growth and well above last year\u2019s 22%. This acceleration is powered by Alphabet\u2019s ever-growing AI infrastructure, including the Gemini models, which power solutions in multimodal AI and real-time analytics.\nStory Continues\nAlthough these tools may not yet resonate widely with everyday consumers, which might explain why some perceive Alphabet as lagging in the space, they are being adopted rapidly by major commercial clients. Noteworthy examples from Q3 include Snap (SNAP) and Hiscox (GB:HXS). In Hiscox\u2019s case, the company was able to reduce the time needed to generate complex insurance quotes from days to just minutes. I think this shows Alphabet\u2019s real potential to drive revenue by creating value for its customers. As its AI tools help businesses run more efficiently and cut costs, more clients will likely be willing to pay for the benefits they\u2019re seeing.\nBut more importantly, Google Cloud is gradually growing as a profit generator for the overall business. Its operating income surged from just $266 million a year ago to $1.9 billion. This huge boost in profitability reflects Alphabet\u2019s success in achieving economies of scale, with the operating margin in the Cloud segment climbing to 17% from 3.2% last year.\nValuation: Wall Street Ignores Superb Top and Bottom-Line Growth\nDespite Alphabet\u2019s impressive Q3 results, Wall Street seems to undervalue the stock. Particularly, Alphabet is trading at just over 21 times the consensus $7.99 EPS estimate for 2024, a rather low multiple given its accelerating revenue and earnings growth, especially in Cloud. Looking further ahead to 2025, Alphabet\u2019s forward multiple drops to around 19 times expected earnings. I believe this makes for a rather attractive valuation compared to the broader S&P 500 (SPX), where many companies trade at much higher multiples with considerably weaker growth prospects. There have been few opportunities historically to buy Alphabet at a sub-20 P/E, and each time, in hindsight, it has proven highly rewarding.\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\nLooking at Wall Street\u2019s view on GOOGL stock, Alphabet features a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buys and six Holds assigned in the past three months. At $207.43, the average\u00a0Alphabet stock price target suggests 21.1%\u00a0upside potential.\nIf you have yet to choose which analyst you should trust if you want to trade GOOGL stock, consider Mark Kelley from Stifel Nicolaus. He is the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe), featuring an average return of 27.87% per rating and an 85% success rate.\nFinal Thoughts\nSumming up, Alphabet\u2019s Q3 results showed outstanding numbers across the board. All core segments, including Google Search, YouTube, and, most notably, Google Cloud, posted excellent top and bottom-line gains. For this reason, I believe that Alphabet\u2019s shares are undervalued at their current levels. With double-digit revenue and earnings growth set to be sustained next year, as well as in the years to follow, Alphabet stock is still trading at a discount, even after its recent post-earnings gains. Therefore, I will remain invested in Alphabet, now my second-largest personal holding.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

Following with anticipated spending of $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion are Google and Meta.\nDriven mostly by investments in generative artificial intelligence and huge language models, the predicted expenditure represents a multi-year potential for hyperscale firms.\n\"Continued AI-driven platform-level innovation on Search, YouTube, and with other offerings improves confidence in the durability of long-term growth,\" said Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Brian Nowak, in an investor note regarding Google.\nMeta still gives leaner operations, productivity, and efficiency first priority. \"Importantly, revenue and engagement trends are also improving across Meta's platform,\" Nowak said. \"Our industry and company conversations speak to progress driving incremental Reels engagement and monetization.\"\nMicrosoft keeps expanding public cloud use and artificial intelligence, so it is a leading spender in this area. \"Multiple expansion and positive estimate revisions will come from greater than expected strength in commercial business in coming years,\" Nowak said.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is projected to spend the most on hyperscaler initiatives in 2025. \"Amazon's high-margin businesses continue to allow Amazon to drive greater profitability while still continuing to invest,\" Nowak added. \"Cloud is in a multi-decade secular adoption cycle, Amazon is gaining share in eCommerce/retail and share of consumers' wallets.\"\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Originally established as a nonprofit AI research facility in 2015, OpenAI established a capped for-profit company in 2019 in order to raise money for expensive AI model building. In a letter to Bloomberg, OpenAI's nonprofit board chairman, Bret Taylor, said \"Any potential restructuring would ensure the nonprofit continues to exist and receives full value for its stake in the for-profit unit.\" Aimed at luring investors, the shift would keep a nonprofit arm with meaningful ownership in the new company, according to OpenAI strategy chief Jason Kwon.\nThe restructuring procedure will probably take a lot of time since asset value will determine regulatory permission. OpenAI has until 2026 to finish the shift under current financing terms; otherwise, the funding will turn into debt, according to The New York Times.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

He noted the surprising sequence in which AI has affected job types, with the automation of white-collar tasks preceding that of blue-collar ones. Gates foresees AI robots performing tasks at construction sites and hotels within a decade.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nAccording to Vanguard\u2019s Advisor\u2019s Alpha Study, working with a financial advisor can result in approximately 3% higher net returns annually, here are the benefits of partnering with a financial advisor and how to find the right one near you in minutes.\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nReflecting on his original vision of a PC on every desk, Gates predicted that AI would extend this concept. He envisions natural language becoming the primary programming language, enabling everyone to have a coding assistant. This shift will allow for more efficient data navigation and business operations without needing custom software.\n\n\nGates also mentioned the potential for AI to streamline software applications, suggesting that many current applications could be consolidated into comprehensive systems.\n\u201cYou know we\u2019ll all have an agent that is a utilitarian help you get things done...your agent can figure out okay which parts of that are important enough to to take your time to understand,\u201d he said.\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nWhy It Matters: The conversation aligns with ongoing discussions about AI\u2019s impact on the workforce. In a recent podcast, Gates and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, explored AI\u2019s role in technological advancement, particularly in the workforce. Studies indicate that 37% of companies have already replaced staff with AI, with 44% predicting AI-driven layoffs in 2024.\nFurthermore, Hoffman has predicted the end of the traditional 9-to-5 job by 2034, attributing this shift to AI and the gig economy. This transformation offers increased productivity and flexibility but raises concerns about stable employment.\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, billionaire Vinod Khosla has predicted that AI will replace most human jobs over the next 25 years. He suggests that AI could perform 80% of all jobs, including those of primary care doctors, salespeople, and engineers, more efficiently than humans.\nRead Next:\nHow do billionaires pay less in income tax than you?

Welcome to Intapp fiscal first-quarter 2025 webcast. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Trone, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. David, please go ahead.g\nDavid Trone\nThank you. Welcome to Intapp's fiscal first-quarter 2025 Financial Results. On the call with me today are John Hall, Chairman and CEO of Intapp; and David Morton, Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the course of this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends strategies and the anticipated performance of our business, including guidance provided for our fiscal second quarter and full year 2025. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and expectations that are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nIntapp disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, except that's required by law. Further on today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results, including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share and free cash flow.\nAs a reminder, all of our financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenue and revenue growth and total remaining performance obligations. Our financial results, along with reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in today's earnings release and its supplemental financial tables, which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K furnished with the SEC prior to this call, or a supplemental financial presentation, which is available on our website.\nWith that, I'll hand the conversation over to John.\nStory Continues\nJohn Hall\nThank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we share the results of our fiscal first quarter. Commencing our fourth fiscal year as a public company, I'm pleased to share that once again, we've achieved strong quarterly results supported by cloud ARR growth, new products, new partnerships, new logos, and expanded client accounts around the world. We also added new applied AI capabilities to our platform and furthered our strategic partnership with Microsoft.\nI'll share details on these select growth drivers throughout this call.\nIn Q1, our cloud ARR grew to $309 million, up 27% year over year. Cloud now represents 74% of our total ARR of $417 million. In the quarter, we earned SaaS revenue of $77 million, up 30% year over year, and total revenue of $119 million, up 17% year over year.\nNow, I'd like to share some highlights from our fiscal first quarter. I'll start with how we're executing on our vertical AI roadmap, specifically our continued applied AI innovation, its practical applications, and our increasing client adoption.\nFirst, we introduced two new AI powered features for Intapp Assist for DealCloud. As you may remember, Intapp Assist brings Generative AI to the daily work of professionals, helping them better apply their intelligence, while driving speed and accuracy.\nIntapp Assist now helps professionals make sourcing recommendations to help professionals quickly identify ideal target companies aligned with firm strategy, such as ideal investment candidates. And Intapp Assist now provides smart tagging to help professionals analyze and organize communications and meeting notes, making complex data easier to search and apply.\nWe are excited that rising client adoption of Intapp Assist for DealCloud is validating our applied AI strategy and its capability to drive tangible results and positive outcomes for our clients. For example, [Serena Clay], Director of International Marketing and Communications at International Investment Bank DC Advisory said, I think a lot of the time what other companies are saying their AI tools can do can be quite performative. But I think the depth to which DealCloud has demonstrated commitment to it, and also their thought process and roadmap for it has been really impressive.\nSecond, we expanded the Intapp Assist product brand by announcing the general availability of Intapp Assist for terms. This new generative AI feature makes it easier for legal professionals to comply with client terms by giving them immediate answers to their questions about contractual terms right in Microsoft Teams. This significantly reduces the time and research needed to comply with outside council guidelines and the firm's client and engagement letter commitments. And it's another example of how we reach professionals in the Microsoft apps they're already using every day, easing adoption and furthering their success.\nAs Carly Numrich, Risk Council at Fredrikson & Byron said, our staff no longer have to go into Intapp terms and search for the right document or contact me with a question. Now, they're able to pull up Microsoft Teams and ask it terms questions, such as what are my payment terms with this client? And Intapp Assist provides the answer. It's a much more streamlined process.\nAnd we're excited to share that Intapp Walls for Copilot is gaining traction in the market as more firms look to apply trusted AI. The solution helps professionals use Microsoft Copilot AI in a secure, compliant manner, while avoiding revealing protected information. We continue to see opportunity to expand our compliance footprint and help firms benefit from AI, while adhering to their regulatory, ethical, and client commitments.\nAs Tori Carrillo, the application manager from law firm, Nelson Mullins, told us, because we use in tap walls to enforce access rules across our networks and applications, I can confidently point Microsoft Copilot wherever we want. And Copilot will pull only from matters that the user has permission to access.\nThese new AI features and capabilities are great examples of how our co-innovation with Microsoft is helping to propel our applied vertical AI strategy. Speaking of Microsoft, I'll now turn to partnerships and share how we're expanding our robust partner ecosystem to drive growth.\nMicrosoft continues to be one of our most prominent partners. We're proud to have launched fiscal '25 with renewed top tier and global ISV partner status with Microsoft, based on strong, joint go-to-market activity and Co-sale success. We continue to grow the number and volume of transactions through the Azure Marketplace in Q1, applying to clients in all our verticals and for both land and expand deals.\nFor example, this quarter, one of the world's largest multinational investment banks significantly increased its number of DealCloud seats for its capital formation team, as it made the use of DealCloud mandatory for specific roles and approval process.\nNext, Cassels Brock & Blackwell, one of the largest business law firms in Canada, purchased in-tap conflicts from the Azure marketplace to manage its conflicts clearance process, reputational risk, and adopt a solution that can scale with the firm's rapid growth.\nAdditionally, our updated partner program, launched a year ago, continues to attract new partners in our target markets. We now have 135 data, technology, and services partners in the program. We're also excited about another six partners who joined the program last quarter, five of which are DealCloud integration partners that bring additional data sets to our already robust platform.\nLet's turn now to Q1, wins and cloud migrations, and share some examples of how we're continuing to grow our client base, expand with existing clients, migrate clients to the cloud, and gain traction in new markets.\nFirst, I'm pleased to share that we're continuing to grow through the addition of new clients, including Crete PA, a private equity-backed network of accounting and professional services firms, which selected Intapp conflicts to centralize, systematize, and simplify the conflicts clearance process for its member firms.\nNext, a nationally recognized restructuring and financial advisory firm, which chose Intapp Conflicts and IntappIntake to support its growth through acquisition.\nWe chose these as illustrations of the growing need for compliance checking by accounting firms, as growth through private equity investment and acquisitions increase in that vertical. We see this trend as a significant growth area for Intapp.\nAnd as we continue to win new clients across all our verticals, both domestically and internationally, here are some examples. In the US, a top-ranked venture capital firm focused on revolutionary technologies, chose DealCloud for its robust CRM capabilities for investor tracking, investor reporting, and pipeline management.\nNext, internationally, TGS Baltic, a leading commercial law firm operating across the Baltic states, chose DealCloud to improve its client account program structure and effectiveness, drive cross-selling, and improve identification of new sales opportunities.\nAdditionally, cross-selling and upselling success in our existing accounts continue to drive strong net revenue retention. A few notable examples include: national CPA and consulting firm, Forvis Mazars, which uses Intapp employee compliance to manage personal independence and recently expanded its relationship with Intapp. The firm added DealCloud to now support its capital advisors team by leveraging AI to manage complex deals more efficiently.\nNext, a multinational law firm and longtime user of our risk and compliance solutions chose DealCloud to support its private equity team. Next, a fast growing business advisory interim management and investment banking firm increased its number of DealCloud seats by almost [400%].\nAnd moving on to cloud migrations, we had steady progress here as well this quarter, including AmLaw 200 firm, Honigman, which chose to migrate its four Intapp compliance solutions to the cloud, so it could gain access to the latest applied AI and streamline its internal processes.\nFinally, a New York-based AmLaw 100 firm chose to migrate its instance of impact time to the cloud, supporting its goals of achieving more compliant time and billing, more efficient and profitable matter management, and increased client satisfaction.\nIn conclusion, we're proud of our strong performance in the first quarter and we're optimistic about our continued growth opportunities. As our Q1 performance has shown, we continue to grow by adding new capabilities to our platform and increasing our global and enterprise go-to-market reach. We see continued opportunity both to add new clients across a broad TAM and to deliver greater value by expanding within our existing client base.\nWe're serving a durable end market with our subscription revenue model, industry specific cloud platform, and applied AI and compliance capabilities. We have a great growth opportunity to drive AI, cloud adoption, and modernization across all the industries we serve. As always, I'd like to thank our clients, our partners, our investors, our Board, and our global Intapp team for their teamwork and dedication. Thank you all very much.\nOkay, David. Over to you.\nDavid Morton\nThanks, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to report a strong first quarter performance driven by solid SaaS revenue growth, an expanding client base, and enhanced operational efficiency. Together, these achievements position us to extend our leadership, as we pursue an exciting market opportunity in fiscal Q2 2025 and beyond.\nAs we begin our fourth fiscal year as a public company, we announced a strategic shift in February focusing on our cloud business over on-premise and service offerings. Accordingly, our disclosures will now highlight SAS revenue and cloud metrics.\nStarting this quarter, our income statement separates SaaS revenue from on-premise support to better highlight the growth trajectory in our cloud business. For fiscal Q1, SaaS revenue was $76.9 million, up 30% year over year, driven by new client acquisitions, contract expansions, and the migration of on-premise products to the cloud. As of fiscal Q1, 92% of our clients have adopted at least one cloud module.\nAs a reminder, our previous disclosure of subscription license included the upfront portion of our on-premise contract. We now report this as license revenue, which also includes the on-premise support portion that previously appeared in SaaS and support. License revenue was $28.5 million in fiscal Q1 of 2% year over year, where price increase and contract expansions were offset by migrations to the cloud.\nTo help bridge the previous SaaS and support taxonomy, revenue totaled in FQ1, [$91.5 million], up 25% year over year, driven by sales to new clients and expansion of existing clients through cross-selling and up-selling initiatives. Professional services revenue totaled $13.4 million, down 8% year over year, reflecting our strategy to de-emphasize services revenue. This approach aligns with our focus on deferring more of these functions to our partners, allowing us to concentrate on overall client satisfaction.\nTotal revenue was $118.8 million, up 17% year over year, driven primarily by sales of our cloud solutions. Our international business continues to present growth opportunities for expansion and greater platform utilization beyond the US.\nRevenue from our international operations remains strong, comprising approximately 34% of total revenue in fiscal Q1, up from 31% a year ago.\nAt the present recent quarters, we continue to invest in and expand our alliances and partner ecosystem around Intapp. Since elevating our partner program a year ago, we have attracted new partners across our target markets, now totaling 135 data, technology, and service partners, a 20% year-over-year increase.\nWith additional accreditation and enablement, these investments enhance our capabilities in deal generation, technology, data, and implementation. And we remain optimistic about their ongoing impact. Intapp's new vertical SaaS AI offerings, Assist and Walls, for Copilot contributed once again this quarter. While it is still early in our product rollout, pipeline development, and client provisioning, we are excited about the growth prospects ahead in fiscal 2025 and beyond.\nQ1 non-GAAP gross margin was 76.3% up from 71.8% in the prior year period. This margin improvement was driven by a services mix and cloud optimization efforts. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $75.6 million compared to $66.5 million in the prior year period, reflecting our continued investment in product-led growth.\nAs we continue to focus on our operational efficiency, non-GAAP operating income was $15.1 million, as compared to $6.4 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.21 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to six cents in the prior year period.\nFree cash flow, which is defined as our cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was $24.1 million for the first quarter, or 20% of total revenue. We exited the quarter with $253.8 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nTurning to our key metrics, cloud ARR was up 27% year over year, and total ARR was up 19% year over year. Total remaining performance obligations were $549.4 million, up 32% year over year. Overall, we remain committed to executing our land and expand model, ending the quarter with over 2,600 clients. Of these, 707 had an annual recurring revenue of at least $100,000, up from $626,000 in the previous year. Our cloud net revenue retention rate highlights our ability to retain and steadily grow business with existing cloud clients, reaching 119% in Q1 FY25.\nNow turning to our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect fast revenue of between $79.5 million and $80.5 million. As these are newly provided revenue outlook metrics, we are also providing the implied year-to-year growth outlook of between 26% and 28%; total revenue in the range of $120.5 million and $121.5 million; non-GAAP operating income in the range of $14 million and $15 million; and non-GAAP ETS results of $0.15 to $0.17 using a diluted share count weighted for the quarter of approximately 83 million common shares outstanding.\nFor the full year fiscal 2025, we expect fast revenue between $327.6 million and $331.6 million. As these are newly provided revenue outlook metrics, we also are providing the implied year-over-year growth outlook of between 26% and 28%. Total revenue in the range of $495.5 million and $499.5 million. We also expect non-GAAP operating income in a range of $61.5 million and $65.5 million. And non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.77, using a diluted share count weighted for fiscal year '25 of approximately $84 million, common shares outstanding.\nThank you. And I'll now turn the call back to the operator.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Steve Enders, Citi.\nSteve Enders\nOkay, great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess maybe just to start, it'd be helpful to, I guess, get a update on maybe what you're seeing out there in the deal environment in? And if there's been any kind of change in some of the macro, or how you're thinking about financial services side in particular, given some of the softness that you saw there in the past year or so?\nJohn Hall\nThanks, Steve. No, we have not seen a change in the deal environment. Demand has been strong. Our pipeline is quite strong. We do have the experience of lumpiness in the large deals, as we've talked about from time to time. But we've not seen anything related to macro, even in financial services, so that's been great.\nSteve Enders\nOh, okay. I guess maybe just to ask a little bit differently. I think we're kind of getting the question from investors just on some of the ARR and billing dynamics here. And I guess it would be good to kind of give your view on maybe how you kind of view the year shaping up from a timing perspective. And if this is maybe in line with your expectations? Or just how you would kind of characterize how this year might take place versus what we might have seen in the past?\nJohn Hall\nSure. So as we've discussed a little bit, Q4 was very strong. We had set up a new strategic team at the beginning of fiscal '24. We had done some investment over the previous years to really develop our enterprise grade features because we were getting interest from larger and larger accounts. And we had good success with that model in '24.\nSo at the start of '25 here, we moved more of our sellers into that same model as strategics. We're calling it enterprise. And we've given more of the named accounts to both a new logo pursuit team and a existing account account management cross sell, up sell team to take advantage of all the new clients that we brought on board in that tier. So Q1 is definitely the time that we move the accounts to the sales team that had good success there.\nWe also have the proof point from last year of how well that went. And there's, as we talked about Investor day, 70% of our sale is in our top 2,000 accounts. So we want to make sure that we put the right resource allocation to set ourselves up for the billion dollars and more.\nAnd that's going well, but we did see some pause in the closing of those large accounts. We did not see anything like that in the mid market accounts, which gives us good evidence about the macro. Also, the commentary has been quite strong and the pipeline is the strongest it's ever been.\nSteve Enders\nOkay, great. That's all the context. Thanks for taking the questions here.\nOperator\nKevin McVeigh, UBS.\nKevin McVeigh\n(technical difficulty) to start framing the impact of the alliance that you have, particularly just continues to kind of be enhanced and you know, just so we get a sense of percentages more broadly kind of where it is today and what that can be over time?\nJohn Hall\nKevin, this is John. I apologize. The beginning of your question was --?\nKevin McVeigh\nSorry, sorry about that. Yeah, just more -- how should we think about kind of the alliances? And you know, does that kind of enhance over time or what percentage of revenue that is today? And how can that scale over time?\nJohn Hall\nThe Microsoft partnership is the largest one, obviously. We've had a very good amount of progress throughout fiscal '24 and continued in the first quarter of fiscal '25 with increased co-marketing and co-selling activities. Obviously, our product announcements around Intap Assist and Walls for Copilot have gone very well.\nThe Azure relationship where the firms can spend part of their minimum. Azure spend their Mac agreement with us because our entire portfolio is available now on the Azure marketplace and the Microsoft sales reps receive commission and quota relief when they sell intact products. So all the components are aligned for us to be co-selling. We also re-qualified for Microsoft's top tier status and global ISE status, which we're very excited about.\nAnd we've got good collaboration in the field. We even have some very important large account deal sharing, lead sharing, going back and forth. And we're co-selling in several important places. So I'm excited about the relationship with Microsoft. It takes a little while to get that going, but a lot of good progress.\nAnd then in addition to Microsoft, we have very strong partnership growth. I gave some stats in prepared remarks. But a lot of data partners coming on board, a lot of services partners helping to expand our reach in different parts of the market and internationally. The partnership program is really developing well.\nKevin McVeigh\nAnd then just to follow up on that, obviously you're seeing a lot of outside success on the margin in terms of literally that the margin upside, particularly relative to how you're guiding. Any thoughts as to what's driving that, number one? And then philosophically, does that continue to flow to the bottom line or do you use that as an opportunity to reinvest and capture more the GenAI opportunity?\nOperator\nOne moment for our next question.\nJohn Hall\nI'm sorry, Kevin. Just to answer your question on margin, Dave, you want to take that one?\nDavid Morton\nYes, I will. Kevin, great question. Thank you. We'll continue to work on our productivity and efficiency, not only on the gross margin, as we continue to scale. We still have some opportunity there. We've been working, and I want to thank, publicly, our services team, continue to bring that to not only neutral, but beyond that, as well as there's still scale opportunity within our cloud operations altogether.\nAnd then when you go below the line, clearly we're going to continue to invest in the company. We've continued to invest. So this hasn't been an absolute reduction, but where you have seen scale has been both in our sales and marketing productivity, as well as in our G&A.\nAnd so when you think about how we continue to invest and stay ahead of the front, specifically in our product led growth organization, that's where you'll continue to see more of an orientation within our product and engineering teams, which gets to your question of GenAI and other narratives on that.\nVery excited about our roadmap and what that will continue to entail, as well as where that leads us in the back half of this fiscal year.\nJohn Hall\nThanks, Kevin.\nOperator\nAlexei Gogolev, JP Morgan.\nAlexei Gogolev\nThank you. Hello, everyone. John, David, may I confirm the implied guidance for share of SaaS revenues in the back half of fiscal 2025? It seems like you're suggesting there might be slightly lower share of those revenues in the second half of the year versus 2Q, maybe some outlook or color, why that might be?\nDavid Morton\nSorry, could you repeat the question? Were you looking at just the pure SaaS or SaaS and support or --?\nAlexei Gogolev\nWell, you're disclosing pure SaaS now and in 2Q you're guiding 67% or there about almost 67% and for full year closer to 66%. Just trying to understand if you're expecting some change in the revenue mix or this is just conservative assumption?\nDavid Morton\nNo, we're being prudent on the overall metrics. I think what you'll see, as we uptick both SaaS as well as the total revenue in total, we do have some shift evolutions as we continue to balance license as we talked about, and putting more in the cloud, which is a time and effort and an evolution, as well as you get an associated pickup when that happens that we've talked about. So it's not a matter of if, it's just when. So that's one balancing impact.\nAnd then the other balancing impact is also how we've continued to articulate the services portion. And that we want to, not only focus more on our customer satisfaction, but then also continue to grow our partner economy. And so that's been a balancing act as we think about our respective guide, all of which continue to be very prudent in our eyes. And so we can continue to deliver the expected results.\nAlexei Gogolev\nGreat, thank you, David. And can you remind us what your outlook is on met new customer additions versus upsell and cross-sell, the ratio that you anticipate going forward?\nDavid Morton\nYeah, we don't guide specifically on that per se, but I can tell you historically, you've seen about 20%, anywhere from, I'll call it, 20% to 40% of net new logo as far as ACB dollars. And then they responded being the expand motion.\nSo we've got the wonderful opportunity, not only to deliver a billion dollars and beyond just on our net new logos, but then also, as you know, as we continue to cross-sell and up-sell, we have a billion dollar opportunity in front of us just on that motion as well. But for this year and our time and place of how we're thinking about the back half of fiscal 2025, it's going to fall into those ranges.\nAlexei Gogolev\nGreat. Thank you, David. Thank you.\nOperator\nCody Kiechle, Bank of America.\nCody Kiechle\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a question on cloud ARR. It just drew 27 and a half percent. Really, really strong performance, all things considered. But I do look at it and it has been decelerating. And I listened to the commentary on the pipeline, which sounds really, really strong. But then I also listened to, you know, it sounds like there might be a little bit of deal elongation out there too.\nSo I guess the question is, what is the potential for this cloud ARR growth metric to accelerate over the next several quarters from here and what would be the drivers for that?\nJohn Hall\nThanks, Cody. So I'll give some points in the day if you can add anything you like. But the core of it is we sell all cloud now, as you know. We're steadily moving up the percentage of the overall business in the cloud, and we report that. So all the new additions add to the cloud growth.\nWe also have more new logos that we acquire each quarter. And so the cross-sell and up-sell that we do to existing clients is all cloud. And so the fundamental growth of the business is in that cloud ARR number. There's also a movement to migrate the existing remaining components of our client base to the cloud. And we talk about that a little bit.\nI think as far as the deals go, as we move up to the larger firms, and you saw some very large numbers in Q4 when we reported the number of million-dollar ARR clients, those firms are, not only large opportunities when we land them, but they're large opportunities when we expand as well. So as we allocated resources to pursue the 2,000 named accounts at the top of the market more and more, which we made a move here in '25 to do more of, I think you're going to see an exciting opportunity for us to bring in larger deals.\nThey do tend to be lumpier, as we've talked about from quarter to quarter. At the same time, when they come in, we can have some really exciting results. So those are the major components.\nCody Kiechle\nGot it. Thanks for that, John. And maybe just a quick follow up here. Last quarter, you gave a percentage of net new ACV coming from AI products at 4%. I know there's some qualitative, or yeah -- qualitative commentary in the prepared remarks.\nBut I was wondering if we could get an updated number, was that this quarter versus last quarter? If you could, please? Thank you.\nDavid Morton\nYeah. Hey, Cody, it's Dave. Yeah, we're just going to provide that more so on an annual basis. We know we kind of brought it out last quarter kind of as a rolling thunder just to give some insight and thought leadership in and around how we're monetizing that. That continues and will continue to provide periodic updates, but not one of a quarterly metric.\nOperator\nAlex Sklar, Raymond James.\nAlex Sklar\nThank you. John or Dave, can you just elaborate a bit more on the changes in the sales team and go to market that you elaborate that you spoke to? How much of the team was impacted? When did you make those changes? And I'm curious, have you seen any market improvements in terms of productivity to that large account team in October that gave you some visibility to take up the full year guide above the Q1B? Thanks.\nDavid Morton\nThanks, Alex. So we tested out the model in '24. At the very top of the market we saw some excellent results. We moved a significant portion of the team at the beginning of fiscal '25 when we gave new territories and comp plans for the year.\nI'm very appreciative of the team's excellent work. We have long standing team members who are very experienced in this industry and there was a lot of collaboration to help move accounts to folks in each area.\nWe also followed through on what we discussed at Investor Day, which was to put the entire team into a new accounts, existing accounts model, because there's a significant number of new logos across the board for us to go continue to focus on and when we can get to a billion dollars or more just doing that.\nBut we also have a billion dollars or more from cross-sell and upsell. So we wanted to make sure we had the right account management investme,t to drive the whole portfolio through the business. The number of million-dollar accounts that we showed in Q4 came both from new logo acquisition and cross-sell into those large accounts, and there's a huge opportunity for us to meet the needs of the underserved market this way.\nSo I think the resource allocation choice that we moved on here was well proven. I think the opportunity going forward, as people now have had a chance to meet everybody and talk to their new accounts and get going with pipeline advancement, pipeline development, and advancing the deals that were handed over to them are in good shape. And so we're excited about the rest of the year.\nAlex Sklar\nOkay, thank you for that color. And then maybe we'll follow up for you, Dave, just in terms of the drivers and cloud NRR this quarter. And any changes between end market growth or expansion by solution-type? And then separately, can you disclose the total NRR number for this quarter? Thanks.\nDavid Morton\nAny key drivers? No. I mean, it's continued success. The teams that continue to garner the expands, right? They do a wonderful job doing cross-sell and up-sell, and continue to monetize those opportunities, which even going back to our analyst stand February 22, you've seen the cohorts of each of those respective years and how big they can be. So that's just the continuation of that.\nI can provide our total NRR and we'll continue to disclose that in our 10-Q. It was approximately 114% within the respective range of 113% to 117%. But I really want to transition everyone over to primary cloud metrics because those are going to be the ones that we're focused on.\nAnd obviously, that we're garnering more and more attention to as well as support and investment thereof, specifically on the expand motion. Because when you go from on-prem to off-prem, it's going to change some of those cohorts as well, right? And so just don't want to get into a reconciliation of how that attribution is going forward.\nAnyway, there you go.\nAlex Sklar\nAll right, great. Thank you both for the color.\nOperator\nSaket Kalia, Barclays.\nSaket Kalia\nOkay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. John, maybe for you. A lot of great examples in the prepared remarks around new and existing customers and around GenAI. Maybe a bit of a broader question. Can you just speak to sort of where you think we are in the journey of converting those on-prem customers to SaaS?\nI mean, there are a lot of things that you can do to entice them to move over. Where are we sort of in that journey? And what do you think is going to change here in fiscal '25 around that? Does that make sense?\nJohn Hall\nThank you, Saket. We talked at Investor Day about the fact that we historically had been at the client's option, but starting in fiscal '25, we were looking to be a little bit more encouraging to move firms along. And we're definitely doing that. We're doing that in a few ways.\nThe first, fundamentally, is you can only get the Generative AI capabilities, and in fact, even more the AI capabilities more broadly in the cloud. And there's a lot of pressure coming from the professionals across these firms to create a more modern experience for them and for the way that they work inside their organizations that they want to take advantage of all these new capabilities. So there's a natural pull that was always there, but I think AI obviously gives a lot of excitement to people to pull that in.\nSecondly, there's a real demand from the firms to move into the cloud because of scalability and reliability and security firms have just come to the correct conclusion that they don't have the IT spend scale to create the right kind of security and scalability environment that they could get working with us and partnering with Microsoft or on Azure that the firms basically just need. And so there's a lot of pressure to the firms to get off their on-prem remaining environments themselves and we're benefiting from that.\nAnd then, you know, I think to your point about what we're doing specifically, we absolutely have a program now in fiscal '25 that we have launched to go through each of the remaining firms that have some on-prem component and help them in a variety of ways to get over the hurdle and move to the cloud platform. Because as Dave showed at Investor Day in some of his client account expansion slides, boy, is it worth it to get those firms onto the cloud because their expansion rate really picks up.\nSo we're making judicious prudent choices in each area to help every firm through a variety of techniques make the case to get there. And I'm excited about how positively we're received. There is not a remaining firm out there that's making an argument that they should be on the cloud -- I'm sorry, be on-prem.\nThey all know they need to get to the cloud. It's just a practical question how do they line up their IT schedule to do that.\nSaket Kalia\nGot it, got it. That makes a lot of sense.\nDave, maybe for you, maybe to the earlier point just around new ARR being lumpy, you know, it's -- total net new error was down year over year this quarter, of course. But maybe the question is, as you sort of look at the strength that INTAP had in Q4, is there anything that, just looking at the postmortem, we need to keep in mind when thinking about timing in terms of how deals sort of fall in one quarter versus the other?\nDavid Morton\nNot necessarily from a pull forward or push out or anything like that or even a nominal seasonality. I do think as we think about really coming into this new fiscal year, and as John alluded to and getting the teams aligned and organized and a sales kickoff and seeing all the success from previous years, where's the opportunity of kind of how we articulated how we're going to get to a billion dollars and the named accounts and mid market and so on and so on, I think for us, as we think about the opportunity coming into this quarter and others, we've been spending a lot more time on kind of our own-type gen, type analytics, pre-shopping, shopping, where those cohorts land.\nAnd to John's earlier point, we haven't seen as strong as type, maybe in the history of our time. And so, you know, we're excited about those opportunities and it's for us to go and monetize and convert those over. And so we like how Q2 started to play out, as well as not only here, but also into the back half of the fiscal year.\nSaket Kalia\nVery helpful. Thanks, guys. Thank you.\nOperator\nParker Lane, Stifel.\nParker Lane\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You talked a lot about the development and go-to-market around some of the Generative AI opportunity. But I was wondering if you could touch on any particular learnings you've had in discussions with your customers around the pricing and packaging of those solutions. Has there been any sort of changes or excitement around the way you guys are pricing? What are your early impressions of how it's being received?\nJohn Hall\nThanks, Parker. You know, I think we, as everybody has, have benefited from the whole GenAI buzz over the past year or two on one hand. So the world has done its work to educate the market, even down to the professional users, that there's the potential for something like this out there. I think we're moving into a phase of the GenAI generation, where the general promise is hitting the real world.\nAnd our strategy, which we have argued from the beginning, is that these generational shifts in the technology, they happen in specific applications. It's the old killer app idea. What is it that's going to pull in these generations of capabilities with very specific applications that really understand the end user.\nAnd I think the vertically oriented companies, obviously, we with this particular end market that's very susceptible to the potential. The whole trick is how do you build very specific applications early on that the user can get an immediate benefit (technical difficulty) coverage and sourcing and origination of new opportunities, cross-selling and looking for opportunities inside the firm's client base.\nAnd I was very excited about this in-tap assist for terms launch, which brings the whole concept into our compliance value proposition to help people just talk conversationally through Teams to Intapp Assist. And it answers questions about their promises to clients across the firm, or some promise that some other professional that's one of their partners made somewhere else in the world that they need to know about when working with the client.\nSo those specific applications are really winning with the individual users and with the firm's leadership. And from a pricing and packaging standpoint, we've seen good success in being able to defend pricing, even in this era when some of the more generic GenAI systems are getting a little bit of pressure.\nWe've got great value because we've been able to isolate down to some of these specific value propositions. Obviously, over time, Intapp Assist will grow and we'll have more and more of those. We'll be a richer and richer platform, but I think the real trick from a marketing and go-to-market standpoint is really to nail those use cases and the team's done a fantastic job. I'm very grateful to the work that they've done and to the clients for taking it up.\nParker Lane\nThat's great feedback. Thanks, John. I'll get back in.\nOperator\nTerry Tillman, Truist Securities.\nTerry Tillman\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. I'm not going to ask about ARR. I'm going to focus on KPMG. I think last quarter you all had a pretty important win, I think, in terms of across their global network of businesses. So maybe after that deal being signed, what can you say about your collaboration product in general? Has that been a linchpin to win more business?\nAnd then secondly, I think that deal was concluded with an Azure Marketplace situation. And so like, what is that doing in terms of reducing friction and getting deals done in terms of the leveraging credits, et cetera? Thank you.\nJohn Hall\nThanks, Terry. So you're right, we were very excited about that announcement. It gives us an opportunity to go across the KPMG network in that case, and they're analogous opportunities for us across the whole market. Historically, this end market, these professional and financial services firms have been underserved by a vertical player like us, and we're bringing a purpose-built platform in the cloud.\nWe have Generative AI that they just haven't had access to before. So we're excited about that.\nWith regard to collaboration specifically, this is the product that is most closely enabled through the Microsoft partnership, because we help firms take advantage of Microsoft Teams and SharePoint and Microsoft 365, Office 365, in a way that works in the professional firms, where it really understands the deals and matters and engagements and projects that the firms are working on. And it also understands the compliance requirements that those teams have as they work together.\nSo we think it's a great fit. KPMG is one example, but we have quite a few new firms that have come on, taking up our collaboration solution in a way that gives us a lot of confidence about the future there. And KPMG is an interesting example in accounting. We've had a lot of uptake in the accounting market, I think because they have been so underserved historically. We're seeing more uptake in the other markets, but accounting has really gotten excited about it.\nSo we're super happy about that. I think with regards to the Azure marketplace question, it has a couple of benefits for reducing friction. One is the firms have already signed a contract with Microsoft that they're going to spend X dollars this year on Microsoft stuff. And so once they've done that, if you can go in and show them capabilities like collaboration that fit their needs for their IT priorities.\nAnd they've already promised to spend the money, why not spend it with you? And I think that's the simplest argument for the Azure Marketplace, is those Mac agreements. But I also think that firms are trying to simplify their vendor relationships. They want to work with people that are at scale that can supply across the portfolio and so the Intapp-Microsoft partnership really helps them simplify their environment.\nAnd the fact that we're helping them get the most value out of the existing Microsoft spend on Office 365 and Teams really helps them as well. So the field loves it when we engage now. This is one of the first questions that the team asks the prospect is, do you have a relationship here? Do you have a Mac agreement? Can we work with you on the Azure marketplace? And the response is generally very positive because people are getting used to buying it that way.\nTerry Tillman\nThanks for the color. Appreciate that.\nOperator\nArvind Ramnani, Piper Sandler.\nArvind Ramnani\nHi, thanks for taking my question. Yeah, I wanted to ask about your kind of partnership with Microsoft, which obviously has been, kind of a really important part of the equation in terms of your AI strategy. So question one is, are you kind of keeping your options flexible. I mean, clearly Microsoft is still leading the way. But you're keeping your options open as this AI technology continues to evolve and change and there may be like a new kind of leader in the space.\nAnd the second thing is, from a cost perspective, is there any risk that Microsoft's going to take it's sort of like leadership position to kind of increase the cost it's pushing with its partners?\nJohn Hall\nThanks, Arvind. On the first point, as we've talked about on other calls at Investor Day, we do have more than one AI technology capability in the company. As we shared with you all, we have been developing AI-based technology for this end market with specialized vertical purpose-built applications for 10 or 15 years. We had some of the first technology in the market 10 or 12 years ago with our time product that helps the lawyers at the time figure out what they should bill for.\nAnd over the years, we have grown our AI team. And Generative AI is the most recent example and now it's kind of news everywhere. But we've been in that line of technology for quite a while, because there's such an opportunity in this market in particular to use AI techniques and AI technologies to help firms make sense of structured and unstructured information in a more productive way.\nSo we're big believers in it. And yes, we do have other technologies working inside the platform. So we're not exclusive with Microsoft on AI technology.\nThat being said, this end market is also a very Microsoft oriented market. The professional firms, the financial firms, particularly in their IT departments, but more generally spend all their time in the Microsoft environment. So the partnership is very important.\nIt's also very strategic for us to make sure we can say yes to these firms and be aligned with their IT strategy. And I think that this actually gives us a real advantage versus technology companies that don't have the same alignment with Microsoft's plan.\nI think your question about cost is kind of the flip side of that. There are all kinds of things progressing in the open source world and elsewhere around AI technologies. And Microsoft certainly has a tremendous position, but there's also all kinds of options out there. So I think we're going to benefit from that as well the whole world and industry on this idea of how do you get the most effective AI at the right cost structure to enable you to bring solutions to market that firms can really take up. And we're going to see how it plays out, but I think Intapp is very well positioned around AI to take the best advantage as we go forward.\nArvind Ramnani\nThat's terrific. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nBrian Schwartz, Oppenheimer.\nBrian Schwartz\nYeah, hi, thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. John, I was hoping to just follow up on your commentary that the large deal activity was -- maybe it was less robust than what the business had seen the last couple quarters. I'm just curious cause the pipeline commentary is very strong. Do you think that that's just seasonality? Or is it a macro or maybe election related? Curious to get what your take is on that.\nJohn Hall\nThanks, Brian. I think because we've seen such consistent performance in our mid-market business, the main factor is the realignment that we did at the beginning of fiscal '25 to put more resources against the 2000 enterprise accounts. I think that's the main driver. Whether the election has something to do with the market generally, we probably would have seen in the mid-market. If it did, who knows to that question?\nBut I think generally speaking, we started the year and did the appropriate assignment of resources to the large accounts with a good proof point from last year about what that could do for us. And I think the opportunity scale is significant. And so we want to build the company to a billion dollars. And I want to make sure we've got the team set up to do it.\nAnd we've got sales professionals who have been through this before. And all they got to do is go meet the firms and get their pipeline advanced. And that's what we saw in the first quarter.\nSo I'm comfortable that we've put the right resources against a very large opportunity here and we're set up to go.\nBrian Schwartz\nThank you for that call, John. Appreciate that. David, maybe just one with you. In terms of maybe the assumptions that's underlining your growth guidance, I'm just curious how you're thinking about the capital markets activity? Are you expecting any change in maybe the end market demand for that segment from maybe what you were thinking three months ago, given how interest rates have changed since you last gave guidance? Thanks.\nDavid Morton\nNo. Thanks, Brian. For us, our end markets have been relatively healthy that we've commented on. We have one aberration that we commented approximately a year ago when we saw some headwinds, specifically with one specific group within overall financial services. But if you think about in broad based, everything's been really healthy, quite candidly. And so, this has been about us and able to execute and drive everything from pipe to conversion.\nWe're just avid believers in our product, our platform. We believe we're one of nobody who's got the very specific purpose-built platforms for what they're looking for. And so it's for us to go execute outside of whether it be election cycle, outside of some of the capital market, interest rates, other things going on.\nBrian Schwartz\nThank you for taking my questions.\nOperator\nThank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to John Hall for closing remarks.\nJohn Hall\nOkay. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your attention and questions. We have a great Q1 behind us and we're excited about our continued momentum throughout fiscal '25. Thanks again for your time today. We look forward to talking to you all next quarter.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) will report later in November.\nThese companies have been capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, leading markets higher.\nRead more: Barclays shares soar to 9-year high as bank posts 23% profit rise\nThe main S&P 500 (^GSPC) index is up 22% so far this year, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) has risen nearly 25% year-to-date.\nLast year, the Magnificent 7 were responsible for more than half of the S&P 500's gain, according to Morgan Stanley.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Given the super high valuations these companies are currently trading at, signs of weakness and numbers which fall short of expectations are likely to spark jolts of volatility and may see positive sentiment seep away.\"\nWill this latest batch of earnings drive these stocks even higher? Here's how each stock performed.\nTesla \u2014 reported on Wednesday 23 October\nElon Musk's Tesla got the group off to a strong start, when it reported its third-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday 23 October.\nWhile the results were mixed, investors cheered the company's beats on earnings per share and higher gross margins, with the stock surging nearly 14.5% in after-hours trading.\nTesla posted revenue of $25.18bn (\u00a319.18bn), which was less than the $25.4bn expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. However, this was higher than the $25.05bn in reported in the second quarter and topped the $23.04bn it posted for the same period last year.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.72, was ahead of an anticipated $0.60, on adjusted net income of $2.5 billion and free cash flow of $2.9bn.\nTesla's closely-watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.\nRead more: IMF upgrades UK growth forecast in budget boost for Rachel Reeves\nIn its earnings deck, Tesla said: \"Preparations remain under way for our offering of new vehicles \u2014 including more affordable models \u2014 which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025.\"\nMusk then said in an earnings call that Tesla's volume growth could be between 20% and 30% next year.\nStory continues\nThese details were welcome news to investors, in light of recent updates that disappointed markets. Tesla recently announced third-quarter deliveries that slightly missed expectations, while the company's highly-anticipated robotaxi event left investors wanting more details.\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said this strong set of results was a \"reminder that, for all its recent challenges, it is one of the few operators to genuinely make the manufacture of electric vehicles pay\".\nHe added: \"The next key test for Tesla is to hit its targeted year-on-year increase in vehicle deliveries for 2024 which will require a pretty sizable acceleration in the remainder of the year.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(TSLA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nAlphabet \u2014 reported on Tuesday 29 October\nGoogle-parent Alphabet smashed expectations with its fiscal third quarter earnings, driving a surge in its shares.\nThe search giant posted earnings per share of $2.12 for the third quarter, which was up 37% on the same period last year and beat forecasts of $1.83, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $88.27bn for the quarter ended 30 September, up 15% on last year and ahead of estimates of $86.44bn.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of the cloud unit in an earnings call on Tuesday, noting that the company's AI portfolio is attracting new customers and leading to larger deals. Cloud revenue came in at $11.4 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, surpassing expectations.\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the medium and long-term threats at play for Alphabet \u2014 the Department of Justice and AI agents \u2014 these are a very clean set of numbers.\"\nEarlier this month, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it was considering whether to recommend the break up of Google to rein in its dominance in the search engine market.\nThe DOJ said in a court filing that it was considering options, including \"behavioural and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search\".\nThis update came after a landmark ruling in August, in which a US district court said Google had illegally monopolised the online search market.\nRead more: Bitcoin investors eye rally if Trump beats Harris in US election\nIn response to DOJ's latest court filing, Google released a blog post entitled: \"DOJ\u2019s radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\"\n\"With new and improving features with search, Google has a decent future even with the DOJ trying to break it up,\" said Barringer.\n\"YouTube has also been very stable which has allowed the business to focus on the areas it needs to, without worrying about its other core components.\n\u201cInterestingly, the cloud business was growing strongly and should provide a good read across for the rest of the sector.\"\nBarringer said that while innovation was coming through in the business, \"the threats are big and thus the stock will struggle despite good short-term trends. Ultimately, investors await what will happen with the DOJ.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOG)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMeta Platforms \u2014 reported on Wednesday 30 October\nMeta disappointed on investor expectations when it shared its guidance for the fourth quarter in its latest results.\nMeta guided to revenue of between $45bn and $48bn for the fourth quarter, with analysts looking for $46.09bn. The company also said it expects capital expenses to grow significantly in 2025.\nWhile this latest set of results weighed on shares, the stock is still up nearly 61% year-to-date.\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said that another area of disappointment for investors in the third quarter figures was daily active users growth on Meta's social media platforms and apps. The company said this figure was up 5% to 3.29 billion individuals in Q3, but this missed the 3.31 billion market forecast.\n\"It\u2019s not simply enough for Meta to move ahead, it needs to stay in the fast lane at all times as far as the market is concerned. Investors typically care about the short term and they want more, more, more,\" he said.\nRead more: Record number of millionaires to leave UK amid tax increase fears\n\u201cEven though Meta owns some of the world\u2019s most popular social media platforms, it still faces significant competition from the likes of TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube. Every minute someone uses a rival platform is a missed opportunity for Meta to generate advertising income,\" he added.\nHowever, it posted beats on earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, earnings per share came in at $6.03, which was ahead of an anticipated $5.25, based on consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nRevenue came in at $40.5bn for the third quarter, beating forecasts of $40.2bn, as well as rising on last year's figure of $34.1bn.\nCoatsworth said Meta was another company spending big on AI. He highlighted that \"improvements to its AI-driven feed and video recommendations led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year. Meta AI is now helping to improve search functionality on its social media platforms, answering questions and being deployed to edit images.\"\n\"It has further applications such as helping individuals with coding and working as a chatbot,\" he added. \"On top of this, Meta\u2019s Llama large language models are being used by companies and organisations including the US government and the company continues to improve its capabilities.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView quote details\nMicrosoft \u2014 reported on Wednesday 30 October\nAnother tech company that didn't quite match Wall Street's expectations with its latest results was Microsoft, despite also beating forecasts on key financial metrics.\nMicrosoft said commercial revenue which includes cloud services sales, came in at $38.9bn compared to expectations of $38.1bn. The company's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure business, brought in $24.1bn in the quarter, up 20% year over year.\nHowever, Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said that the \"downbeat stock reaction is likely due to guidance given on the call\".\n\"Margins are expected to come under pressure next quarter as the ramp-up in AI spending hits the cost line, and with Azure growth expected at 31-32%, that would mark a slowdown quarter-on-quarter,\" he added.\nRead more: Lloyds profits flat but beat estimates\nEven so, Microsoft still posted earnings per share of $3.30, which were ahead of of analyst forecasts of $3.10, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue of $65.6bn also topped expectations of $64.5bn.\nOne of the latest areas of competition for major technology firms is digital agents powered by AI, with Microsoft jumping into the race last week.\nMicrosoft recently announced the rollout of its Copilot AI features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. These AI tools, known as autonomous agents, are custom-built applications that can handle specific tasks, with the aim of freeing up employees to focus on more strategic work.\nIn full-year results released at the end of June, Microsoft said revenue was up 16% to $245bn, while operating income had risen 24% to $109bn. In addition, net income had grown 22% to $88bn.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView quote details\nAmazon \u2014 reported on Thursday 31 October\nE-commerce giant Amazon posted stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than expected on Wall Street.\nAmazon reported earnings per share of $1.43, which was ahead of estimates of $1.16, while revenue came in at $158.9bn against forecasts of $157.29.\nThe company also said it expected revenue in the range of $181.5bn to $188.5bn in the fourth quarter, versus analyst forecasts of $186.36bn.\nIn terms of operating income, Amazon said it expected this be between $16bn and $20bn in final quarter of the year, compared with estimates of $17.49bn.\nShares popped on the back of this latest earnings release, up 31% year-to-date.\nRead more: The best stocks to buy in the UK, according to Barclays\nMamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Amazon's \"online sales and international growth both proved strong, while AWS remained steady. Much of the online success is as a result of consumers continuing to be price cautious.\"\nShe highlighted that Amazon's cloud business results came in line with expectations with revenue up 19%.\n\"AWS is benefiting from AI budgets being implemented by businesses, with demand currently exceeding capacity, and while traditional workload migration also remains healthy,\" Valechha said.\n\u201cAll in all, this was a positive update from Amazon and investors seemed to agree with the stock trading well in the after hours,\" she added. \"Given softer numbers earlier this year it is good to see Amazon bounce back and live up to expectations once again.\u201d\nAmazon's second quarter disappointed in terms of revenue performance.\nWhile Amazon's earnings of $1.26 per share exceeded expectations of $1.04, net sales of $147.98bn was just shy of an anticipated $148.78bn revenue figure.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView quote details\nApple \u2014 reported on Thursday 31 October\nShares in Apple dipped following the release of its fourth quarter results.\nApple reported earnings per share of $0.97 on revenue on revenue of $94.9bn. The company said it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay \u20ac13bn to Ireland for back taxes.\nWithout the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3bn.\nApple's iPhone sales beat forecasts, at $46.2bn for the quarter, against expectations of $45bn. However, revenue of $24.9bn from its services business, fell short of expectations of $25.2bn.\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: \"Apple is at a major turning point in its career.\nRead more: Dividend stock picks to consider when investing as interest rates fall\n\u201cThe roll-out of its AI-powered Apple Intelligence service could be a powerful catalyst to encourage consumers to upgrade products such as phones and laptops.\n\"Unfortunately, mass upgrades won\u2019t happen overnight as the service is only being rolled out on a phased basis,\" he added. \"That means the market is judging Apple more on what it\u2019s doing today, not what it could do tomorrow, and the pace of growth isn\u2019t strong enough to excite.\"\nHe said that Apple had been \"late to the party with AI and the pace of hardware innovation feels pedestrian compared to previous decades\".\nDespite the criticism around this latest set of results, Coatsworth said it was clear that the business \"has been busy laying the foundations for future growth\".\n\"Each of its core products has a trick up its sleeve to win over the consumer,\" he said.\nIn terms of its Apple Intelligence service, Coatsworth said it \"might take at least another quarter to see if the AI facility is compelling enough to boost sales\".\n\u2022 USD\n(AAPL)\nFollow\nView quote details\nNvidia \u2014 reports on Wednesday 20 November\nNvidia's third quarter earnings are slated for release later in November. The chipmaker has been closing in on Apple's top spot as the world's most valuable company, with a new record high close last Monday, taking its market valuation past the $3.5tn mark.\nThis latest advance in share price comes as Wall Street analysts reiterated on their bullish outlook on the company.\nFor example, Bank of America (BAC) raised its price target on Nvidia from $165 to $190 per share, citing strong demand for AI.\nRead more: The best funds to invest in according to expert research teams\nOther recent catalysts behind the stock include the company recently saying that its Blackwell AI chips had already sold out for the next 12 months.\nIn the second quarter, Nvidia posted 122% revenue growth versus the same period last year to $30bn.\nThe company's gross margin came in at 75%, while net income had increased to $16.6bn.\nFor the third quarter, Nvidia said it expected revenue of $32.5bn, \"plus or minus 2%\".\nThe chipmaker also anticipated a gross margin of 74.4%, \"plus or minus 50 basis points\" and this to be in the mid-70% range for the full year.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nRead more\nStocks to watch: BP, Shell, Uber, HSBC and Intel\nThe best stocks to buy in the UK, according to Barclays\nFive alternatives to Mag 7 stocks if you missed out on Nvidia\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

The software integrates seamlessly with Azure DevOps to provide simplified management, increased efficiencies and potential cost savings by allowing clients to use Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitments.\nIBM Rides on Cloud, AI Traction\nIBM is poised to benefit from healthy demand trends for hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI), which drive the Software and Consulting segments. The company\u2019s growth is expected to be aided by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long haul. A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely boost profitability.\n\nIBM has inked a partnership with Intel Corporation INTC to deploy the latter\u2019s Gaudi 3 AI accelerators as a service in IBM Cloud. With this, IBM became the first cloud service provider to deploy Gaudi 3 across hybrid and on-premise environments.\n\nAimed to offer improved visibility and control over the software stack, simplifying workload and application management, the collaboration intends to help customers cost-effectively scale enterprise AI workloads while prioritizing performance, security and resiliency. The offering, slated to be available by early 2025, is likely to pave the path for more innovations in Generative AI to help unlock its full potential.\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx Platform Fueling Higher Demand\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. This enterprise-ready AI and data platform comprises three products to help organizations accelerate and scale AI \u2014 the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning, the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose data store built on an open lake house architecture and the watsonx.governance toolkit to help enable AI workflows to be built with responsibility and transparency.\nStory Continues\nIBM's Price Performance\nBuoyed by strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, IBM has surged 38.5% over the past year compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 32.2%, outperforming peers like Microsoft but lagging Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.\nOne-Year Price Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEstimate Revision Trend of IBM\nIBM is currently witnessing an uptrend in estimate revisions. Earnings estimates for 2024 have moved up 3.5% to $10.11 over the past year, while the same for 2025 has increased 1.2% to $10.56. The positive estimate revision portrays bullish sentiments about the stock\u2019s growth potential.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIBM Plagued by Margin Woes\nDespite solid hybrid cloud and AI traction, IBM is facing stiff competition from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Increasing pricing pressure is eroding margins, and profitability has trended down over the years, barring occasional spikes. The company\u2019s ongoing, heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud is challenging. Weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain significant concerns. IBM\u2019s third-quarter performance was also dented by a pause in discretionary spending owing to economic uncertainty due to geopolitical turmoil, the U.S. Presidential elections and the evolving landscape of interest rates and inflation levels.\nKey Valuation Metric\nFrom a valuation standpoint, IBM appears to be trading at a premium relative to the industry and is trading well above its mean. Going by the price/book ratio, the company shares currently trade at 7.78, higher than 3.42 for the industry and the stock\u2019s mean of 5.85.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEnd Note\nIBM aims to benefit from the increasing propensity of business enterprises to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to secure multi-cloud management with a diligent focus on hybrid cloud and generative AI solutions. With a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment and quantum computing, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which has led to a healthy demand trend.\n\nHowever, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), IBM appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution. It is also trading at premium valuation metrics and investors could wait for a better entry point to cash in on its long-term fundamentals. Consequently, it might not be prudent to bet on the stock at the moment.

          "whole_article": "Former Microsoft Corporation CEO Steve Ballmer has invested $40 million in USAFacts this year to fortify democracy amid political unrest.\nWhat Happened: Ballmer founded USAFacts, a non-profit initiative, in 2017 out of a desire to better understand how government funds, including his own tax dollars, were being used.\nUSAFacts has grown this year with a new series of videos that aim to provide voters with \"no rhetoric, no bias, just the facts\" on pressing issues like inflation and immigration \u2014 key points of debate in the current U.S. election, reported Financial Times.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nAre you rich? Here\u2019s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? \u2013 How does it compare to the average?\nWhile Ballmer's past videos on YouTube showcase his famously high-energy, animated presentations at Microsoft, his approach with USAFacts is far more reserved.\nIn these videos, Ballmer calmly presents data and speaks over animated charts in a subdued tone for up to 15 minutes at a time.\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\n\nDespite the rise of artificial intelligence and the role of social media platforms in spreading misinformation, Ballmer identifies the mobile device as the main distraction for the public, the report noted.\nTrending: $100K Sitting In A CD Account, Should I Move Money Into The Stock Market?\n\"I won't say it's Facebook or Twitter [now X] or Instagram or TikTok particularly, but they have built upon the usage patterns that make sense for the mobile device,\" he told the publication.\nThe former CEO and owner of the Los Angeles Clippers has also upped his annual funding for USAFacts from $10-20 million to $40 million this year.\nHowever, Ballmer conceded that gauging the impact of his initiative is difficult. While\u00a0USAFacts has 360,000 newsletter subscribers\u00a0and his video series has amassed over 45.5 million views, the effect on voters\u2019 decisions remains unclear.\nWhy It Matters: Ballmer\u2019s wealth has been significantly boosted by Microsoft\u2019s AI-driven stock rally. In July, his net worth reached $157.2 billion, making him the sixth-richest person globally. Over 90% of his net worth was tied to Microsoft shares.\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nAt the time of writing, Ballmer was ranked ninth on Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index, preceded by the likes of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates.\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, the\u00a02024 U.S. presidential election, scheduled for\u00a0Nov. 5, 2024, features a significant matchup between\u00a0Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and\u00a0Republican nominee Donald Trump.\nThis election is being characterized as pivotal, with both candidates underscoring the stakes for democracy and the future of American society.\nImage via Flickr\nRead Next:\nI\u2019m 62 Years Old And Have $1.2 Million Saved.

The company has developed a dataset of proteins from the HPV genome and is identifying cytotoxic T cell (CTL) targets to choose for a clinical trial for TVGN 920, its first oncology product. Through Tevogen\u2019s proprietary ExacTcell\u2122 technology, where CTLs are trained to detect specific targets and then expanded, the company aims to be prepared to deliver an HPV-specific CTL treatment.\n\u201cOur ExacTcell technology, which has proven effective in developing SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs, can be rapidly adapted to create CTL products targeting a wide range of viruses, including HPV,\u201d said Dr. Neal Flomenberg, Chief Scientific Officer at Tevogen Bio. \u201cWhile the specific targets may vary between viruses, the platform itself is well-established, enabling a swift response to emerging infectious threats.\u201d\n\u201cBy leveraging Microsoft\u2019s cutting-edge AI and cloud technologies, we\u2019re able to accelerate our target identification and pre-clinical processes in ways that weren\u2019t previously possible,\u201d said Mittul Mehta, Chief Information Officer and Head of Tevogen.AI. \u201cOur partnership is allowing us to automate critical steps in the development pipeline, enhancing our readiness to quickly address additional indications, such as HPV.\u201d\n\"With national healthcare cost and patient affordability at the forefront of our presidential candidates\u2019 agendas, the urgency is clear,\u201d commented Ryan Saadi, Founder and CEO, Tevogen Bio. \u201cIn 2023, U.S. healthcare spending reached an astounding $4.8 trillion - 17.6% of GDP - highlighting the potential impact on economic prosperity. As the new administration charts its course, Tevogen looks forward to being part of a sustainable solution.\"\nStory Continues\nAbout Tevogen Bio\nTevogen is a clinical-stage specialty immunotherapy company harnessing CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to develop off-the-shelf, genetically unmodified T cell therapeutics to treat infectious disease and cancers, aiming to address the significant unmet needs of large patient populations.

          "whole_article": "Microsoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this software maker have returned -0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has lost 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.16 per share, indicating a change of +7.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.95 points to a change of +9.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.80 indicates a change of +14.3% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $68.85 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11%. The $277.69 billion and $315.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.3% and +13.5%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $65.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16%. EPS of $3.30 for the same period compares with $2.99 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.82%. The EPS surprise was +7.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $982.26 million, indicating a 24.97% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.65 per share and a revenue of $3.9 billion, representing changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, from the prior year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.13% lower. CrowdStrike Holdings is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nLooking at valuation, CrowdStrike Holdings is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 83.15. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 31.17 for its industry.\nInvestors should also note that CRWD has a PEG ratio of 2.95 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.3 as of yesterday's close.\nStory Continues\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 85, placing it within the top 34% of over 250 industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

The report recognizes CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Cloud Security\u2019s innovation and performance, earning perfect 5/5 scores in critical functionality areas including API Security, Security Automation and Orchestration, Threat Hunting and Anomaly Detection, Scalability, Cost, and Compliance.\nAccording to the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report, cloud exploitation cases surged by 110% over the past year, with adversaries becoming increasingly focused and persistent. Stopping cloud breaches requires a modern CNAPP that delivers comprehensive visibility and protection across every attack path. CrowdStrike is the only platform that protects the entire modern cloud estate\u2014infrastructure, applications, data and AI models\u2014from a single, unified platform, so organizations can easily consolidate point products, reduce complexity and stop cloud breaches.\nCrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Security is differentiated from point cloud security tools in the market in the following areas:\nConsolidated Code to Cloud Protection: With unified visibility and protection in a single-agent and agentless platform architecture, CrowdStrike eliminates security gaps and stops cloud breaches without making customers manage different cloud security point products. Customers can consolidate the disjointed point products across their entire cloud estate to reduce overall costs and eliminate complexity.\nBuilt to Stop Breaches: Many CNAPPs are thinly veiled CSPMs, built as cloud vulnerability management tools lacking capabilities to stop cloud breaches. CrowdStrike stops threats in real-time with advanced runtime protection delivered from the same unified agent as CrowdStrike\u2019s best-in-class EDR and Identity Protection. Leveraging world-class managed threat hunting and intelligence, CrowdStrike sets the standard for cloud detection and response (CDR) as a native part of the most comprehensive cloud security platform, built to stop the breach.\nComplete Hybrid Cloud Security: With most organizations operating a hybrid architecture, CrowdStrike provides unified protection across cloud and on-prem environments through a single sensor. This ensures full visibility and security coverage, including cloud-native technologies like ASPM, which work seamlessly across both cloud and on-prem applications. CrowdStrike stops attackers as they move between environments, eliminating gaps and simplifying hybrid cloud security.\nStory Continues\n\"Cloud security is at a critical inflection point\u2014adversaries are more relentless than ever, leveraging stolen identity credentials to exploit cloud environments as a preferred attack vector. Traditional approaches and point cloud security tools are not sufficient to provide the visibility and protection needed to stop cloud breaches,\" said Raj Rajamani, head of products, CrowdStrike. \"At CrowdStrike, we are redefining what\u2019s possible in cloud security. Being recognized as a Leader by GigaOm underscores our relentless innovation and leadership in the market. Falcon Cloud Security goes beyond visibility\u2014it provides automated intelligence, threat hunting, protection and scalability, empowering organizations to not only detect cloud issues but also stop breaches in real time, outpace adversaries, and confidently secure their cloud environments for the future.\"\nAccording to Chris Ray, Principal Analyst at GigaOm: \"Falcon Cloud Security received a 5/5 in several areas, most notably in API security. This high score is attributed to its ability to positively identify APIs used by applications in client clouds, as well as analyze upstream and downstream communication among applications and services to understand risks.\" He added: \"The solution also stands out in scalability, leveraging a cloud-native architecture claimed to handle trillions of events per day while also supporting smaller deployments of less than 100 assets\u2026The solution\u2019s comprehensive approach makes [Falcon Cloud Security] valuable for securing cloud-native applications, managing cloud misconfigurations, and protecting against advanced threats in cloud environments.\"\nFor more information on the GigaOm Radar Report for Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs), please visit our website.\nAbout CrowdStrike\nCrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, has redefined modern security with the world\u2019s most advanced cloud-native platform for protecting critical areas of enterprise risk \u2013 endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data.\nPowered by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud and world-class AI, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform leverages real-time indicators of attack, threat intelligence, evolving adversary tradecraft and enriched telemetry from across the enterprise to deliver hyper-accurate detections, automated protection and remediation, elite threat hunting and prioritized observability of vulnerabilities.\nPurpose-built in the cloud with a single lightweight-agent architecture, the Falcon platform delivers rapid and scalable deployment, superior protection and performance, reduced complexity and immediate time-to-value.\nCrowdStrike: We stop breaches.\nLearn more: https://www.crowdstrike.com/\nFollow us: Blog | Twitter | LinkedIn | Facebook | Instagram\nStart a free trial today: https://www.crowdstrike.com/free-trial-guide/\n\u00a9 2024 CrowdStrike, Inc.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in CrowdStrike Holdings implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\nInsiders have been selling lately\nEvery investor in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CrowdStrike Holdings.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CrowdStrike Holdings?\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nWe can see that CrowdStrike Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of CrowdStrike Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in CrowdStrike Holdings. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.6%. With 7.5% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO George Kurtz is the owner of 3.1% of the company's shares.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nStory Continues\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.. Insiders own US$3.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over CrowdStrike Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with CrowdStrike Holdings .\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

He said that firms depend heavily on big technology companies for computing power and the ability to deal with large data sets related to AI. If these major operators experience glitches, catastrophic results could radiate outward.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

He added that a lot of time and effort would be freed up when there is a set of regulator-approved control standards for the industry.\nYue said banks are required to conduct risk assessments of AI service providers to strengthen their operational resilience and must have in place contingency plans to address potential service disruptions caused by third parties.\nStory Continues\nThese \"basic, common sense\" moves are essential to better safeguard companies and other institutions, said James Elwes, HSBC's chief information officer for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"[Third-party risk management] starts with simply identifying where your concentration risk is and documenting that,\" he said. \"If you've not done that, you're not going to do any of the next steps that are important.\"\nVendor diversification could help to solve some issues, Elwes said, but he added that big tech companies are often the most well-equipped to be third-party service providers.\n\"There are benefits to concentration simply because of the nature of some of these organisations - the scale they can provide and the investment they can put in,\" he said.\n\"So a degree of concentration on vendors, especially within technology, is likely to remain.\"\nSarah Breeden, deputy governor at the Bank of England, said in a pre-recorded speech that financial institutions are expected to have a \"stronger and more rigorous\" grasp of AI as they increase their dependence on it for \"higher impact areas of their businesses.\" These areas include credit risk assessment, capital management and algorithmic trading.\nHong Kong's government unveiled its first guidelines on the responsible use of AI on Monday.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks on the list of crowded software short positions.\nWith the close of 2024 approaching fast, artificial intelligence continues to set the narrative on Wall Street. The tail end of October marks the start of another highly anticipated earnings season, which for the most part, will continue to be dominated by AI. On the hardware front, investors will be on the lookout for whether the demand for AI GPUs is sustaining and if the firm that is the market leader is also improving its margins and profitability. For software stocks, investors will pour over profitability data to determine whether the billions of dollars invested in training and testing AI as well as in business partnerships are yielding results.\nFor software stocks, their exposure to AI is so strong that it has divided the 2024 stock performance of some firms into neat halves determined by investor sentiment about their AI products. One such AI software stock ranked 5th on our recent list of AI stocks that insiders are selling. Looking at its year-to-date share price performance, it\u2019s rather neatly divided into two halves that converge on June 13th. Year to date on June 13th, the shares were down 19.8% even though the firm\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenue was a cool $19.4 billion and had grown by 10% annually. Before that eventful day, the firm\u2019s first quarter had seen it grow revenue by 11% annually but struggle to keep costs low and profit margins high.\nYet, the investor bearishness surrounding this well-known provider of productivity software tools such as Photoshop and Reader, would change in the blink of an eye. From June 13th to the third week of October, the shares have reversed course and gained 8.5%. In fact, between the 13th and September 12th, the stock had gained 27.9%. June 13th was the day that this firm reported its second-quarter earnings. The results led to its shares jumping by 13% in aftermarket trading, with investors impressed by the fact that the firm increased full-year guidance to range between $21.40 billion and $21.50 billion from an earlier $21.30 billion $21.50 billion.\nThe optimism was driven in part by the firm\u2019s Creative Cloud business which includes products such as Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, and Express. The AI addition to Creative Cloud was the firm\u2019s set of generative AI models dubbed Firefly. Management shared that Firefly was at the heart of the ARR guidance bump to $1.95 billion as they shared:\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the Digital Media business and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services and Express. We\u2019re pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half.\u201d\nWith AI profitability driving the second-quarter earnings season, investors were naturally ecstatic and sent the stock higher.\nHowever, the June respite would be short-lived as the shares tanked by 13.4% in September. As usual, AI was the culprit. The downward trend started in the form of a 9.2% drop in after-market following the firm\u2019s third-quarter report. It saw the company guide Q4 revenue at a midpoint of $5.525 billion which fell below the $5.61 billion analyst consensus.\nWhile this firm is a consumer and professional software stock, the broader software as a service (SaaS) industry hasn\u2019t been spared by the AI-driven Wall Street trends either. SaaS and software stocks are predominantly valued through two metrics: the Rule of 40 and EV/Sales (or variants such as EV/EBITDA or Price to Sales). These multiples are somewhat unique to the software and SaaS stock narrative as they evaluate the firms based on their ability to grow. This is key since one of the main reasons behind SaaS stock popularity is that they do not have to deal with inventory, logistics, or supply chain issues like other businesses.\nIn the AI era, SaaS valuation multiples and revenue growth estimates have been severely compressed. Data shows that the median price to forward sales SaaS multiple is 5.5x right now. The valuations are driven by lower growth expectations. After AI and the decimation ushered in by high interest rates, just 1% of SaaS and software companies have a 12-month future revenue growth rate higher than 30% as of June 2024. Digging deeper, investors have also placed a higher premium on growth as while firms with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 have a median EV/Sales multiple of 8.9x, those with a growth rate greater than 30% but a Rule of 40 score lesser than 40 have a median multiple of 11.6x.\nThese AI-driven software shifts, precipitated by worries of a reduction in SaaS demand due to businesses self-developing software using AI have also affected investor sentiment. According to Jefferies\u2019 latest Trading Positioning Survey, 19% of institutional investors were overweight on software stocks as of October 2024, a sharp drop over July\u2019s reading of 28% and January\u2019s 51%. Yet, investors have also tempered their short positions as Jefferies shows that 54 software stocks were shorted as of October compared to 73 in July.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software short positions, we ranked the top nine crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 69\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.12%\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a well-known cybersecurity software provider that rose to fame earlier this year after its faulty software update led to an unbelievable 8.5 million computers going offline worldwide. The outage also flipped the firm\u2019s narrative, as the shares lost more than 42% of their value over the next two weeks. However, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has managed to control some of the damage from the outage as its shares are up 24.9% year to date and 41.6% since the post-outage bottom. Part of the recovery is based on easing investor worries of customer loss as CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) might be able to prevent fallout due to high switching costs. Investors will nevertheless be on the watchout for customers jumping ship, and they will also monitor CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2019s fiscal 2031 recurring revenue guidance of $10 billion and midpoint free cash flow margin of 36%.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of crowded software shorts according to Jefferies. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $982.26 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25%. The $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +27.5% and +22.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) closed at $301.32 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.23% move from the prior day. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.27%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.65%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.26%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the cloud-based security company had gained 5.16% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.21% and the S&P 500's gain of 2% in that time.\nThe upcoming earnings release of CrowdStrike Holdings will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.82, indicating constancy compared to the equivalent quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $982.26 million, reflecting a 24.97% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\nCRWD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 1.13% lower. CrowdStrike Holdings is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that CrowdStrike Holdings has a Forward P/E ratio of 82.46 right now. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 31.88.\nIt's also important to note that CRWD currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.93. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Internet - Software industry stood at 2.1 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 61, finds itself in the top 25% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nStory Continues\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "By David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said on Monday it sued Delta Air Lines in U.S. District Court in Georgia after a faulty software update prompted a global outage in July.\nThe July 19 incident led to worldwide flight cancellations and hit industries including banks, healthcare, media companies and hotel chains.\nCrowdStrike said it sued to make clear that CrowdStrike did not cause the harm that Delta claims, and that Delta repeatedly refused assistance from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. Delta did not immediately comment on CrowdStrike's suit.\nCrowdStrike is seeking a declaratory judgment plus legal fees.\nDelta's lawsuit filed on Friday in Fulton County Superior Court called the faulty software update from CrowdStrike \"catastrophic\" and said the company \"forced untested and faulty updates to its customers, causing more than 8.5 million Microsoft Windows-based computers around the world to crash.\"\nDelta said the faulty update caused 7,000 flight cancellations, disrupted travel plans of 1.3 million customers and cost the carrier more than $500 million.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit, also filed on Friday, said Delta's own response and technology caused delays in the carrier's ability to resume normal operations.\nCrowdStrike's lawsuit reiterated its contention that it has minimal liability, something Delta rejected.\nDelta said CrowdStrike is liable for over $500 million in out-of-pocket losses as well as for unspecified lost profits, expenditures - including legal fees - reputational harm and future revenue loss.\nThe incident prompted the U.S. Transportation Department to open an investigation.\n\"If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed,\" Delta's lawsuit says.\nDelta said it has invested billions of dollars in information technology licensing and infrastructure.\nLast month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologized before Congress for the faulty software update.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The astonishing rally in U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. The prime factor was the unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology worldwide.\nLately, a section of market analysts and financial researchers have raised concerns about the potential profitability of massive investments in generative AI by several technology giants. We believe that AI applications will continue to gather pace in the coming years, buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet.\nAt this stage, we recommend three technology behemoths with extensive applications of generative AI. These companies are - Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nBuy 3 Tech Giants With Extensive AI Applications\nThese three companies have beaten their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom lines in third-quarter 2024. These stocks have solid price upside potential in the short term.\nIn the long term, these stocks have a higher earnings per share (EPS) growth rate than the broad-market S&P 500 index, which should drive their stock prices in the next 3 to 5 years. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nAlphabet Inc.\nA deepening focus on generative AI technology is a major positive for GOOGL in this data-driven world. Google has been well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\nAlphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI (Gen AI) solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products. GOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance the search results continue to boost traffic on GOOGL\u2019s search engine.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nStory Continues\nIn addition, GOOGL\u2019s Vertex AI enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models. These generative AI capabilities are aiding GOOGL in enhancing search results, accelerating Android development, boosting healthcare reach and delivering enhanced cloud experience.\nExcellent Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 21.6% from the last closing price of $169.24. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$235. This indicates a maximum upside of 38.9% and no downside.\nAlphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12% and 11.4%, respectively, for 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 2.8% in the last seven days. GOOGL currently has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 17.6%, higher than the S&P 500\u2019s long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAdobe Inc.\nAdobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster.\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\nThese services help businesses streamline marketing and products for targeted consumer groups, including chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers.\nAdobe is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products. ADBE\u2019s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are driving top-line growth. The major positives are rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps.\nGrowth in emerging markets and robust online video creation demand remain tailwinds. Additionally, solid demand for Adobe\u2019s commerce offerings and the growing adoption of Acrobat are encouraging. Adobe\u2019s strong market position, compelling product lines and continued innovation remain positive.\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\nRobust Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 26.2% from the last closing price of $481.35. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703. This indicates a maximum upside of 46% and a maximum downside of 8.6%.\nAdobe has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.9% and 12.4%, respectively, for next year (ending November 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.2% in the last 60 days. ADBE currently has a long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%, in line with the S&P 500.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBroadcom Inc.\nBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers. AVGO\u2019s solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers.\nThe acquisition of VMware has benefited the Infrastructure software solutions of Broadcom. VMware\u2019s expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy. AVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\nSolid Price Upside Potential for AVGO Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.9% from the last closing price of $168.55. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $150-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 42.4% and a maximum downside of 18.6%.\nBroadcom has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 16.7% and 27.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2025 (ending October 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.4% in the last 60 days. AVGO currently has a long-term EPS growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500\u2019s long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this chipmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 2.59%, on average, in the last two quarters.\nFor the last reported quarter, Broadcom Inc. Came out with earnings of $1.24 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 per share, representing a surprise of 3.33%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.10 per share, delivering a surprise of 1.85%.\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Broadcom Inc. Lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nBroadcom Inc. Currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.24%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nStory Continues\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

However, non-AI revenue continues to hold back Broadcom's overall performance as sales in those areas remain relatively sluggish. Despite this, Broadcom's CEO Hock Tan stated during the earnings call that the slowdown in non-AI revenue has now bottomed out.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with EHAB.\nBroadcom: A Compelling Opportunity Amid AI Growth and VMware Integration\nAVGO Data by GuruFocus\nShares of Broadcom dropped 10% after its earnings release (has recovered these lost gains as of now), even though the company reported better-than-expected results for Q3. Revenue jumped 47% YoY, driven largely by the AI boom and VMware's contribution. Still, this positive report coincided with weak macroeconomic data, particularly in a week marked by poor labor market data. This led to investors panicking and thus the sell-off.\nBroadcom has a large exposure to non-AI revenue, which is more cyclical and sensitive to macroeconomic dynamics. This cyclicality and sensitivity to macro pressures might have amplified the effects of the sell-off as well. Despite this, I view Broadcom as a buy opportunity. The company continues to maintain high gross margins and generate substantial free cash flow. In my opinion, the more compelling aspect of the recent earnings was the progress in VMware's integration, which aligned with Hock Tan's guidance and reflects his successful history of strategic acquisitions.\nBroadcom's Growth Driven by VMware Integration\nBroadcom's top-line growth continues to be driven by the VMware acquisition. In Q3 FY24, the company outperformed both revenue and non-GAAP EPS expectations, with its Infrastructure Software segment showing an impressive 200% YoY growthup from 175% the previous quarter. However, this YoY growth comparison isn't directly comparable, as VMware's revenue wasn't included in last year's results. During the earnings call, management noted that VMware generated $3.8 billion in revenue for the quarter, with QoQ growth accelerating to 40.7%, up from 28.6% in Q2.\nStory Continues\nVMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) was a standout, with its annualized booking value reaching $2.5 billion in Q3, reflecting a 32% QoQ increase. On the flip side, excluding VMware, Broadcom's core software business saw a significant QoQ slowdown. While the overall company revenue grew 47.3% YoY in Q3 FY24, without VMware, the core business growth was just 4% YoYdown from 4.9% growth in Q3 FY23. Management acknowledged the slowdown but was quite optimistic over the outlook, stating that non-VMware software revenue has now stabilized and is expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate moving forward.\nMixed Performances in the Semiconductor Solutions Segment\nBroadcom's Semiconductor Solutions segment continues to experience challenges. After showing the first signs of recovery in Q2, the segment's revenue declined 4.8% YoY in Q3, totaling $7.3 billion. However, the AI-driven demand from hyperscalers for Broadcom's networking and custom AI chip products was a bright spot, with the Networking product segment growing by 43% YoY. Despite this strength, the rest of the Semiconductor Solutions segmentparticularly non-AI networking, server storage, and wireless productsunderperformed, with relatively flat growth. According to management's outlook, this weakness is expected to persist over the next few quarters. Nonetheless, CEO Hock Tan emphasized multiple times during the earnings call that the deceleration in non-AI revenue has likely reached its lowest point.\nStrong Margin Expansion\nOne of Broadcom's key strengths lies in its margin performance, especially following the VMware integration. In Q3, the company posted gross margins of $8.4 billion, marking a 36% YoY growth. Gross margin percentage rose to 64% from 62% in the previous quarter, driven by strong demand for AI-related products. GAAP operating margins also expanded to 32.4%. The Infrastructure Solutions segment saw a 700bps sequential margin improvement, while Semiconductor Solutions margins improved by 80bps. Non-GAAP gross margins, which adjust for amortized intangible assets and other expenses, reached 77%, up from 75% a year ago. These expanding margins are one of the main reasons for my bullish view on Broadcom at the current price levels as well.\nBroadcom: A Compelling Opportunity Amid AI Growth and VMware Integration\nAVGO Data by GuruFocus\nImpressive Free Cash Flow Generation\nBesides its strong margin performance, Broadcom's free cash flow generation is another reason for my bullish view. The company generated $4.8 billion in free cash flow in Q3, a 4% YoY increase with a robust free cash flow margin of 37%, up 1 percentage point QoQ. This strong cash generation offsets any material risks for Broadcom, in my opinion, and provides the company with flexibility to return more value to shareholders through dividends or stock buybacks.\nHealthy Balance Sheet and Debt Management\nBroadcom ended Q3 with $10 billion in cash and $72 billion in debt, which incurred an annual interest expense of roughly $4 billion. Given management's Q4 estimates for EBITDA margins at 64%, I estimate Broadcom's leverage ratio to be around 2.3x on an adjusted basis, which is a relatively safe level. It's worth noting that credit rating agencies have recognized Broadcom's solid capital structure, with Fitch upgrading its credit rating in August and S&P doing so in November 2023, following the VMware acquisition.\nAI Growth Momentum\nBroadcom's AI-related revenue continues to grow, with the company reporting $3.1 billion in AI revenue for Q3 FY24 and guiding to $3.5 billion for Q4 FY24. However, the full-year AI revenue forecast of $12 billionup from the previous guidance of $11 billionfell short of market expectations, raising concerns about a potential normalization of growth in the next fiscal year. This cautious outlook is reminiscent of Nvidia's recent earnings, which also hinted at tempered growth expectations in the AI sector. Despite these concerns, I believe the AI investment theme remains strong, as tech companies continue to upgrade their infrastructure to remain competitive.\nNon-AI Revenue Stabilization\nManagement has expressed optimism regarding the stabilization of Broadcom's non-AI revenue, pointing to a 20% YoY increase in non-AI bookings. This growth, along with management's guidance that the cyclical downturn in non-AI revenue has \"passed the bottom,\" should provide investors with some better confidence in the company moving forward. As the company navigates the market's evolving expectations around AI revenue, I believe Broadcom's competitive advantagesparticularly in networking solutionswill continue to drive its success in the AI space, while non-AI segments gradually recover.\nValuation Perspective\nBroadcom's current valuation appears more attractive than it did several months ago, when enthusiasm for AI hardware makers such as NVIDIA and AMD was at its peak. With management's upgraded forecasts for Q4, Broadcom is on track to achieve approximately 44% revenue growth, bringing its total revenue to around $52 billion for the year. This strong performance, along with the potential for further margin expansion following the solid results from Q3, suggests that a forward P/E multiple higher than 35x is justified.\nBroadcom: A Compelling Opportunity Amid AI Growth and VMware Integration\nAVGO Data by GuruFocus\nAt present, Broadcom is trading at a forward P/E of about 29x, which represents a discount compared to its AI-centric peers, who are trading relatively higher in the 30x-35x range. Given Broadcom's exposure to the AI market, its ability to generate consistent free cash flow, and its year-over-year gross margin expansion, I believe a P/E multiple of 33x is attainable. Under this scenario, the stock would be valued at around $205 per share, implying an upside potential of roughly 15%.\nBroadcom: A Compelling Opportunity Amid AI Growth and VMware Integration\nSource: Alpha Spread\nLooking at the valuation from a DCF perspective, based on Wall Street estimates, the model points to an even bigger upside of approximately 25%, with an intrinsic value of $240 per share. This DCF model assumes a discount rate of 8% and a terminal growth rate of 3% after the forecast period. It also factors in strong top-line growth, with revenue expected to increase from $60 billion in Year 1 to $136 billion by Year 5. Alongside this, net margins are projected to grow from 41% in Year 1 to 503% at the end of the forecast period. While these assumptions are optimistic, they effectively capture the significant potential upside for Broadcom at its current valuation levels.\nFinal Thoughts\nI strongly recommend considering Broadcom, as the company has consistently demonstrated its ability to grow both sales and profits. Despite a 29x forward P/E multiple that may initially appear expensive, Broadcom's profit growth trajectory of 20-30% annually makes it a compelling investment. The company is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on the AI revolution, with increasing global spending on AI-focused hardware being a potentially multi-decade opportunity. Broadcom's recent financial performance, driven by its strong AI exposure and the successful integration of VMware, supports this thesis. With management guiding to even higher AI-related revenues and margin expansion, the outlook remains strong. Additionally, its undervaluation compared to AI peers, combined with consistent free cash flow generation, further strengthens the case for owning Broadcom at these levels. Analysts currently anticipate an almost 30% YoY jump in profits next year, and with a robust pipeline in AI networking solutions, I believe the company's future growth is far from being fully realized. For a company that delivers such consistent earnings growth and substantial cash returns to shareholders, Broadcom remains an attractive buy at its current valuation.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Broadcom Inc. (AVGO).\nBroadcom Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.18, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.18 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 30 are Strong Buy, representing 90.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AVGO\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for AVGO\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Broadcom Inc. here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Broadcom Inc., it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs AVGO Worth Investing In?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Broadcom Inc., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $4.82.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in November.\nAmid soaring valuations of AI stocks, beginner investors keep wondering whether they are too late to the AI party. However, investing experts believe that opportunities abound in the AI space because of the nature of this technological revolution.\nWhile talking to Wall Street Journal during the\u00a0WSJ Tech Live Conference, venture capitalist Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, explained why he believes there is no such thing as \u201ctoo late\u201d when it comes to AI for now.\n\u201cWhen it comes to AI, it really feels like the marginal cost of language, reasoning and creation are going to zero. And if that\u2019s the case, this is a supercycle. And if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ve got decades. So there\u2019s no \u201ctoo late.\u201d In that sense, we\u2019re still very, very early.\u201d\nThe AI revolution is quickly entering the phase where we are seeing real-life use cases as AI is helping companies significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency. According to a detailed report published by Benesch\u2019s AI Commission, an AI-based tool that monitors real-time data from electronic medical records reduced unexpected deaths in hospitalized internal medicine patients by 26%.\nCasado also talked about the usability of AI models for actual problem-solving:\n\u201cEverybody looks at the OpenAIs. But as far as value creation and integration, if you look at all the private companies, the smaller companies that are building their own smaller models, they are some of the fastest-growing companies we\u2019ve seen in the history of the industry.\u201d\nAlso Read\u00a010 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\u00a0and\u00a010 Best Mid-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now.\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and earnings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nibm, pc, testing, closeup, isolated, human, technician, mainboard, technical, white, tool, hardware, power, business, engineering, repairman, processor, install, occupation,\nSergiy Zavgorodny/Shutterstock.com\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nBill Baruch, President, Blue Line Futures, recently said while talking during a program on CNBC:\nStory Continues\n\u201cIt\u2019s breaking out. The stock looks terrific. If you look outside of Nvidia, it\u2019s been the best performing. It\u2019s the diversification they have as well with the subscription business and the infrastructure building within that space. I think this name is going to continue to rise. We hold it not only in our main portfolio but in our concentrated portfolio.\u201d\nUBS recently published a list of stocks it believes will be industry leaders by 2030. UBS believes the next decade will favor companies that use technology to disrupt industries.\n\u201cWe see these as leading disruptors in industries undergoing technological change, which should have a lasting impact,\u201d said UBS analyst Hartmut Issel in a note.\nThe firm identified 29 companies it expects to deliver stronger earnings growth than the broader market (S&P 500, NASDAQ), supported by \u201cpositive, long-term trends,\u201d according to Issel.\nBroadcom\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0was among these stocks in the Enabling Tech category.\nAccording to UBS, revenue for enabling tech could rise to $1.2T by 2025, or ~15% CAGR from FY20\u201325.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. The company expects about $12 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2024, which means 20% of its total revenue will come from AI and counting.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in November. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nBroadcom Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Hock Tan, for US$26m worth of shares, at about US$173 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$169. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).\nBroadcom insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\ninsider-trading-volume\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nBroadcom Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Broadcom. Specifically, insiders ditched US$60m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of Broadcom\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Broadcom insiders own 1.3% of the company, worth about US$10b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Broadcom Tell Us?\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Broadcom.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Arista Networks ANET, Tesla TSLA and ServiceNow NOW.\n3 Momentum Stocks About to Surge (TSLA, NOW, ANET)\nOne of my favorite ways to pick winning stocks by combining two of the most effective methods out there; the Zacks Rank and momentum. The Zacks Rank is a highly effective quantitative strategy that aggregates all analyst ratings of a stock and converts them into a simple ranking. Momentum is one of the most well documented edge and is well known as a premier anomaly for investors to utilize for successful trading.\nTogether, these two techniques have helped me detect dozens of huge winners in the stock market and right now they have identified three highly compelling stock picks. Arista Networks, Tesla and ServiceNow all boast a top Zacks Rank and an A+ technical momentum setup, leading me to believe that they may be huge winners in the coming weeks and months.\nTesla: Bullish Setup and Strong Buy Stock\nTesla stock has been on a rather volatile and uncertain path this year as electric vehicle sales have slowed markedly. However, CEO Elon Musk is a master of surprising to the upside, and with humanoid robots, self-driving cars and a multitude of other side-bets within Tesla, there is always the potential for a huge run in the stock.\nOver the last two months, analysts have started to upgrade their earnings estimates for Tesla, and it now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 13.4% over the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have jumped by 7.5% over the same period.\nBut most notable is the technical chart pattern forming in Tesla stock price. After gapping higher following its quarterly earnings report, the price action has been building a highly compelling descending wedge. If the stock can trade above the $250 level, it would signal a breakout and may send the stock on another major bull run. Alternatively, if it loses the $240 level of support, the pattern will be invalidated, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.\nArista Networks: Stock Breaking out Now\nArista Networks, a leading provider of high-performance networking solutions primarily for data centers and cloud computing, is another stock to watch. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, ANET also boasts strong earnings growth forecasts and sits in the top 13% of the Zacks Industry Rank.\nOver the next three to five years, Arista Networks is projected to increase its earnings per share by an impressive 15.3% annually. Sales are also expected to grow nicely, with estimates of a 16.3% increase this year and 17.4% next year.\nStory Continues\nArista Networks stock is also breaking out of its technical pattern today. After building out a bull flag over the last month, ANET is staging a clear breakout. If the stock can hold above the $400 level, it should be the start of another rally. However, if it reverses and loses the breakout level, it may be a sign that the stock needs more time before climbing higher.\nServiceNow: Poised for Growth and a Bullish Breakout\nServiceNow is a cloud computing company that offers a suite of software solutions for IT service management, human resources, customer service, and more. These products help organizations automate routine tasks, enhance productivity, and improve employee and customer experience.\nServiceNow is a rapidly growing technology company that also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Earnings are projected to grow 24.7% annually over the next three to five years, while sales are expected to climb 22.3% this year and 20.1% next year.\nLike the other two stocks, NOW stock looks to be developing a very bullish technical pattern. After beating earnings estimates and gapping higher, the price action has been consolidating into a picture-perfect bull flag. Today, NOW stock is bumping up against the upper level of resistance, and if it can break out above the $955 level, it should send the stock significantly higher. However, if it loses the $930 level of support, investors may want to hold off and wait for other opportunities.\nShould Investors Buy NOW, ANET and TSLA Shares?\nThe current setups for Arista Networks, Tesla, and ServiceNow are quite convincing, blending strong fundamental growth with technical momentum. Each company boasts robust earnings growth forecasts, competitive market positions, and favorable chart patterns, making them solid candidates for those seeking high-potential momentum plays.\nFor investors with an appetite for growth and momentum, NOW, ANET, and TSLA offer a balanced blend of technical and fundamental indicators suggesting strong performance ahead. As always, keeping an eye on key price levels and being a keen risk manager will be key for trading them successfully.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

          "whole_article": "One of my favorite ways to pick winning stocks by combining two of the most effective methods out there; the Zacks Rank and momentum. The Zacks Rank is a highly effective quantitative strategy that aggregates all analyst ratings of a stock and converts them into a simple ranking. Momentum is one of the most well documented edge and is well known as a premier anomaly for investors to utilize for successful trading.\nTogether, these two techniques have helped me detect dozens of huge winners in the stock market and right now they have identified three highly compelling stock picks. Arista Networks (ANET), Tesla (TSLA) and ServiceNow (NOW) all boast a top Zacks Rank and an A+ technical momentum setup, leading me to believe that they may be huge winners in the coming weeks and months.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla: Bullish Setup and Strong Buy Stock\nTesla stock has been on a rather volatile and uncertain path this year as electric vehicle sales have slowed markedly. However, CEO Elon Musk is a master of surprising to the upside, and with humanoid robots, self-driving cars and a multitude of other side-bets within Tesla, there is always the potential for a huge run in the stock.\nOver the last two months, analysts have started to upgrade their earnings estimates for Tesla, and it now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 13.4% over the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have jumped by 7.5% over the same period.\nBut most notable is the technical chart pattern forming in Tesla stock price. After gapping higher following its quarterly earnings report, the price action has been building a highly compelling descending wedge. If the stock can trade above the $250 level, it would signal a breakout and may send the stock on another major bull run. Alternatively, if it loses the $240 level of support, the pattern will be invalidated, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nArista Networks: Stock Breaking out Now\nArista Networks, a leading provider of high-performance networking solutions primarily for data centers and cloud computing, is another stock to watch. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, ANET also boasts strong earnings growth forecasts and sits in the top 13% of the Zacks Industry Rank.\nOver the next three to five years, Arista Networks is projected to increase its earnings per share by an impressive 15.3% annually. Sales are also expected to grow nicely, with estimates of a 16.3% increase this year and 17.4% next year.\nStory Continues\nArista Networks stock is also breaking out of its technical pattern today. After building out a bull flag over the last month, ANET is staging a clear breakout. If the stock can hold above the $400 level, it should be the start of another rally. However, if it reverses and loses the breakout level, it may be a sign that the stock needs more time before climbing higher.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nServiceNow: Poised for Growth and a Bullish Breakout\nServiceNow is a cloud computing company that offers a suite of software solutions for IT service management, human resources, customer service, and more. These products help organizations automate routine tasks, enhance productivity, and improve employee and customer experience.\nServiceNow is a rapidly growing technology company that also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Earnings are projected to grow 24.7% annually over the next three to five years, while sales are expected to climb 22.3% this year and 20.1% next year.\nLike the other two stocks, NOW stock looks to be developing a very bullish technical pattern. After beating earnings estimates and gapping higher, the price action has been consolidating into a picture-perfect bull flag. Today, NOW stock is bumping up against the upper level of resistance, and if it can break out above the $955 level, it should send the stock significantly higher. However, if it loses the $930 level of support, investors may want to hold off and wait for other opportunities.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy NOW, ANET and TSLA Shares?\nThe current setups for Arista Networks, Tesla, and ServiceNow are quite convincing, blending strong fundamental growth with technical momentum. Each company boasts robust earnings growth forecasts, competitive market positions, and favorable chart patterns, making them solid candidates for those seeking high-potential momentum plays.\nFor investors with an appetite for growth and momentum, NOW, ANET, and TSLA offer a balanced blend of technical and fundamental indicators suggesting strong performance ahead. As always, keeping an eye on key price levels and being a keen risk manager will be key for trading them successfully.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "The market for ServiceNow, Inc.'s (NYSE:NOW) shares didn't move much after it posted weak earnings recently. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nSee our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-history\nZooming In On ServiceNow's Earnings\nOne key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.\nServiceNow has an accrual ratio of -0.40 for the year to September 2024. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$3.4b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$1.34b. ServiceNow shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On ServiceNow's Profit Performance\nAs we discussed above, ServiceNow's accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is a positive for the company. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that ServiceNow's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at an extremely impressive rate over the last three years. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing ServiceNow at this point in time. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for ServiceNow and you'll want to know about these.\nStory Continues\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of ServiceNow's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "Bill McDermott is very intense.\u00a0When he first joined ServiceNow as CEO in 2019\u2014he was previously CEO of SAP\u2014he met all 7,000 employees and shook hands with every single one of them.\n\u201cIn the first hundred days I was here, I travelled the whole world. The whole world. I met every single person that works for this company in person, and shook their hand.\u201d\nHandshake intensity is a thing, in McDermott's world.\nThe first handshake is incredibly important, he says. It\u2019s part of his mindset, especially for dealing with clients. He advises sales people, upon entering a room with a prospective client, to \u201cfind the decision-maker and shake his hand, but be the last one to let go.\u201d\nHe spoke to Fortune recently in a penthouse suite at the Four Seasons hotel in London, during a business trip to meet clients.\nQuestion 1: Does this handshake thing really work?\n\u201cYes, it does.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not a perfunctory exercise to greet somebody. It's not a perfunctory exercise to shake somebody's hand. They have to know you're in the room and you have to let them know that you care,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo just to shake hands as if it's just some standard thing to do is not enough.\u201d\n(So, was my handshake any good? \u201cYou were fine. I wasn't judging you.\u201d)\nMcDermott\u2019s stewardship of ServiceNow is certainly working. Five years later, ServiceNow has 26,000 employees, revenues of $2.8 billion per quarter and a market cap of more than $195 billion.\nThe AI-driven enterprise software company counts clients such as IBM, KPMG, and Deloitte, for whom it provides a vast range of back-end software that handles customer service, IT operations, security, and new employee on-boarding, among dozens of other services.\nThe handshake thing is a good example of McDermott\u2019s intense, driven style. This is a man who only sleeps for five hours a night. He wakes up at 5 a.m., reads three newspapers, drinks an espresso, does a light workout and walks his dog, Amber. He\u2019s in the office by 8 a.m. He usually continues working until 11 p.m. at night.\nQuestion 2: Can you really get by on just five hours\u2019 sleep?\n\u201cFive hours a night, you know, which is fine,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the week, you know, like it's \u2018go time.\u2019\u201d\nHe sleeps a bit more on weekends.\nQuestion 3: Does ServiceNow have supply issues with Nvidia?\nMost products offered by ServiceNow are driven by AI.\nSo is he getting what he needs from Nvidia, the AI chipmaker that has been accused of not being able to meet demand for all its customers?\n\u201cPerhaps we're fortunate because we have such a strategic relationship but Nvidia has fulfilled all of our requirements and done a great job,\u201d he says.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe started building models with Jensen [Huang, the CEO] several years ago, and we were the first mover in enterprise software building with Nvidia's GPU stack.\u201d\nQuestion 4: Will you cave to Robby Starbuck?\nMcDermott isn\u2019t afraid of the usual culture-war controversies that have come to bedevil leaders at large corporations. ServiceNow, for instance, has a well-developed, public facing DEI program, of the type that has lately become unfashionable.\nRobby Starbuck\u2014the conservative activist who organizes boycotts of companies that he believes are too \u201cwoke\u201d\u2014recently forced Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson, among others, to back away from their DEI initiatives.\nSo what will McDermott do if Starbuck comes calling?\n\u201cWell the good news about ServiceNow is we haven't played \u2018acronym bingo,\u2019\u201d McDermott says.\n\u201cIf you're not growing and you're managing and all you talk about is corporate acronyms, that could be a problem for that phone call. But when you're growing like we are, we have to source talent from every corner of the earth to keep up with the pace of our growth. So if we didn't believe in diversity, if we didn't have an equitable and an inclusive culture, there's no way we could be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. So I think that call would be pretty simple.\u201d\nQuestion 5: Is working remotely OK?\nMcDermott is not a fan of 100% remote working. He asked the company to return to the office about two years ago. ServiceNow currently has a flexible policy in which some employees come in two days a week unless they are designated remote workers.\n\u201cI believe strongly that people do their best work in person.\u201d\n\u201cWe need everybody in the company to cross-pollinate and innovate and work as teams. So, basically, when I asked the company to do it, I didn't have to mandate it. I just had to say, we need it now, we have to hit the accelerator, people came back.\u201d\nBut when the CEO says \u201cwe need it now,\u201d surely that's a mandate?\n\u201cIf they trust you, it's not a mandate. It's a desire. It is \u2018I need you. I trust you. I want you with me.\u2019 I'm not telling you I have to have you tied to a chair, and I'm not telling you I'm going to fire you if you don't do it. I'm telling you, I need you to do it and I don't ask for things that I don't need. And they responded next day, the parking lots are all full. There\u2019s a difference between leading and managing and I don't think it's healthy to actually have people that feel forced into things,\u201d he says. \u201cOne volunteer is worth 10 pressed people.\u201d\nQuestion 6: Are you a micromanager or do you prefer to delegate?\nThis question is important because McDermott has, in the past, insisted on riding along on sales calls with his staff.\n\u201cI hire people that are the best in the world at what they do and I trust them with my life. I think trust is the ultimate human currency and I think the best leaders hire people that are substantially better than them. In every area of domain expertise. So, if you have a CFO, they have to be better than you at finance. If you have a CHRO, they have to know more about the people equation than you do. If you hire a head of engineering, they have to be an extraordinary exemplar of an engineering manager and they should know a lot more than you do. In other words, when I look around the table of my leadership team, I'm humbled, that's how good they are.\u201d\n\u201cI also believe strongly that we have to go into the details and we have to be with our customers and we have to be shoulder to shoulder with the customer so you understand the pain that they deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cI become obsessed with their problems. And I want 26,000 people to be obsessed with their problems, so we come up with new solutions to make them better.\u201d\nQuestion 7: What is the most difficult thing you have tackled as CEO?\nGrowing the company from 7,000 people to 26,000 must have involved some difficulties.

Top findings include a group of AI Pacesetters\u2014government organizations relatively more advanced in using AI and other emerging technologies\u2014that are driving efficiency and achieving better outcomes than organizations that have been slower to adopt AI-powered workflows and automation. Key insights illuminate the unique ways Pacesetters use AI to improve citizen and employee experiences, strengthen compliance, and scale business processes.\nAccording to the research, many government organizations have yet to reap the full benefits of digital technology and relatively few are leveraging innovation to advance their diverse missions. The report outlines best practices implemented by Pacesetters that can be replicated in other government organizations to improve outcomes.\n\"In today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, governments need AI-driven solutions to meet the evolving expectations of citizens and employees,\" said Jonathan Alboum, Federal CTO at ServiceNow. \"This report reinforces that leading governments are already reaping the benefits of AI through accelerated service delivery, citizen experience, and employee productivity. Whether you\u2019re a Pacesetter or still in the beginning stages of a digital journey, these findings show that the future is promising for those willing to embrace AI.\"\nKey findings from The State of AI-Powered Transformation in Government include:\nImproving Speed of Mission\nPacesetters significantly improve their speed and agility by integrating automation into their organizations\u2019 processes. This profoundly impacts both government employees and the citizens they serve.\nFaster time to value with more benefits. Most Pacesetters (61%) achieve a 1.5X faster return on digital investments and report greater outcomes from those investments \u2013 including higher asset utilization and return (50%), improved compliance and risk management (49%), and faster public services (41%).\nAutomating workflows with end-to-end platforms. Pacesetters are making greater progress in implementing end-to-end platforms, with 67% expecting to make advanced progress within the next three years. Currently, 59% have invented new cross-functional workflows that leverage human and AI collaboration.\nAccelerating productivity and ability to scale transformation. Pacesetters boost productivity via specific digital solutions, such as mobile apps (64%), performance management systems (43%), and AI-enabled tools (38%). Those investments are paying off for Pacesetters, measured by improved staff retention (49%), employee upskilling and reskilling (44%), and productivity (41%).\nStory Continues\nAI-Powered Citizen Service Delivery\nPacesetters are finding new momentum within their Citizen Experience (CX) efforts through unique uses of AI and other digital solutions. This is not only improving citizen service delivery but also helping build trust.\nReshaping government services with AI. Governments are using AI in various ways to accelerate citizen service delivery. The top uses for AI among Pacesetters include personalization of citizen communication and engagement, continuous service improvement with feedback loops, and citizen queries and recommendations.\nTechnology improves citizen experience and builds trust. Pacesetters are making greater use of apps and automation to reach citizens. Compared to the general population of government agencies in our survey, Pacesetters are more likely to deploy mobile apps that citizens can use to access government services (47%), digital identities for easy and secure access to public services (46%), and automated responses to citizen problems or requests (44%).\nTech investments are beginning to drive CX improvements. Those embracing AI are starting to see the tangible CX benefits from their digital solutions investments, reporting higher increases in self-service success (47%) and higher citizen satisfaction (45%).\nTo view the full research report and uncover how governments across the globe can improve their AI-driven transformation, please visit: https://www.servicenow.com/lpwhp/state-of-ai-powered-transformation-in-government.html.\nMethodology\nServiceNow and ThoughtLab surveyed 1,248 leaders from around the globe and across agency types to determine how much progress government organizations have made in driving AI-powered business transformation across local, state/provincial, and national government organizations.\nAbout ServiceNow:\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the UBS' Top Tech Based Disruptive Stocks For 2030: Top 29 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software as a service (SaaS) firm that provides business process management products and services. This means that the stock and the firm's revenue are dependent on business activity which is influenced by economic health. Consequently, as the economy has continued to chug along in 2024, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s stock is up 38% year to date. Over its four latest quarters, the firm has raked in $1.3 billion in trailing twelve month net income on the back of continued deal diversification. Through this, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) grew its customers with recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% in Q2, and it added six new customers with annual contract value greater than $10 million in Q3. These metrics are key for SaaS companies like ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) as they help broaden the revenue base and add margin heavy revenue to the income statement.\nDuring the Q3 2024 earnings call, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s management shared key details about its deals:\n\"From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was very strong, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 1.88%\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the biggest SaaS companies in the world. The firm provides products that enable users to automate their business processes and manage human resource operations, IT operations, and others. The firm has raked in $1.1 billion in trailing twelve-month net income and its shares are up 33.5% year to date. Since it\u2019s a SaaS stock, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u2019s narrative depends on its ability to sustain revenue levels, maintain profitability, grow its customer base, and increase the portion of larger deals within the overall mix. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) appears to be executing well on these fronts. During the second quarter, the firm grew customers with annual recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% and its committed remaining performance obligations by 31% to a whopping $18.6 billion. The latter is a particularly important metric since it measures the money that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is nearly guaranteed to receive in the future. This helps evaluate the firm\u2019s future cash flows.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in\u00a0Adobe\u00a0and\u00a0ServiceNow\u00a0earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 6th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) and RTX Corp. (RTX), as well as a micro-cap stock FONAR Corp. (FONR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nShares of Apple have gained +21.7% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry\u2019s gain of +22.4%. The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter\u2019s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s shares have gained +9.2% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry\u2019s gain of +19.7%. The company\u2019s diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy are performing well, fueled by increasing demand. Label expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.\n\nNovo Nordisk has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by making serious investments in increasing its manufacturing capabilities. It is now indicated in the United States and the EU to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost. The positive recommendation in the EU for approval of Wegovy for heart failure is also encouraging.\n\nHowever, the CRL for insulin icodec in the United States is a setback for the company. Intense competition in the obesity sector also threatens Novo Nordisk\u2019s market share. Patent expiry, pricing pressures across the diabetes market and the pipeline setbacks remain concerning. Estimates have declined ahead of third-quarter earnings results.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\n\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+62.2% vs. +5.0%).

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ServiceNow, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NOW a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $13.83.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.3%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.36 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for NOW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nFollowing the latest results, ServiceNow's 38 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$13.2b in 2025. This would be a sizeable 26% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 32% to US$8.54. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$13.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.07 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.9% to US$991. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on ServiceNow, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,170 and the most bearish at US$716 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 21% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 22% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. So although ServiceNow is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ServiceNow following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nStory Continues\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

He notes that the majority of overall AI spending comes from hyperscalers like Microsoft, Alphabet\u2019s Google, and Amazon, which invest in AI infrastructure.\nRelated Videos\n03:39\nSuper Micro prelim. earnings just 'a whole lot of unknown': Analyst\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 27 minutes ago\n03:15\nMarkets shrug off election uncertainty.

Some leaders like Comerica\u2019s (CMA) chief banking officer, Peter Sefzik, have indicated that they want to see another 50 to 100 basis points cut. Krisiloff says the earnings calls from financial executives show \u201cthe gap between the confidence in financial markets versus the real economy.\u201d\nKrisiloff adds, \u201cI think everybody is kind of waiting for more rate cuts here. I think even the Fed has just acknowledged that the rate cuts that they've had so far are just to bring us to a somewhat less restrictive stance. They still want to get to a neutral stance. But I think many actors in the economy are looking for a stimulative stance, and so the Fed's hand may really be pushed toward that stimulative stance over time.\u201d\nConsumer resilience is also a common theme of third quarter corporate earnings calls. \u201cResilient has been the most used word on earnings calls for the last two years now, as we've all been surprised that a recession really hasn't come through despite the higher interest rate environment. The consumer has just continued to spend.\u201d\nHe continues, \u201cWhat you're really seeing is a continuation of a bifurcation of the consumer where high- and moderate-income consumers are still spending a lot, and low-income consumers are really under pressure \u2026 I think what we're seeing right now in terms of consumer resilience is that employment is still carrying the day. As long as people are getting a steady paycheck and feel secure in their jobs, people are spending, and so that is powering the economy. The consumer is really the underpinning force of all of this.\"\nStory Continues\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\nView Comments"
