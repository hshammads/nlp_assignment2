(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe extent to which AI tech may disrupt life as we know it in the coming years is still shrouded in mystery. However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThis number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report.\u00a0 The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family. On November 6, Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson raised the price target on the stock to $655 from $575 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. In an investor note, Sanderson detailed that the company delivered a solid beat-and-raise Q3 as its AI leadership driven by a massive infrastructure moat and superior data scale was becoming more apparent. He added that Meta's continued improvement in near-term results, driven by AI and longer-term opportunities from a multitude of gen-AI efforts, could sustain the upward motion of the stock's valuation beyond the 30-times earnings multiples seen among other mega-cap tech leaders.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss.\nThere has been a lot of buzz around AI startups in the past few years, with funding rounds fetching hundreds of millions of dollars and valuations climbing to record highs. For example, OpenAI, of ChatGPT-fame, has become the most valuable private company in the world with a value of over $150 billion in the past few weeks. No other tech startup in the history of the United States has ever been this valuable before a public offering. This valuation is a reflection of the boundless potential of AI. Latest reports, published by news agency Reuters, reveal that the startup is presently involved in talks with authorities in California, where it is based, over a change in business structure that will allow it to become a for-profit business.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nIn 2015, OpenAI was founded as a non-profit AI research lab. The shift towards the for-profit tag is likely to make the company even more attractive to investors. OpenAI has many big tech names among investors, including giants like Microsoft. Reports suggest that since the first billion it invested in the startup back in 2019, the tech giant has invested another $12 billion in the AI firm, bringing total investments in the startup to around $13 billion. The extensive capital spending has led to concerns about threats to fat margins at the company and added pressure on profitability. Market intelligence firm Visible Alpha estimates that the tech giant\u2019s capital spending for a single quarter now is more than its annual expenditure used to be until fiscal 2020.\nREAD ALSO: 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's November Portfolio.\nStock markets are roaring amid Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Jim Cramer, who has long believed that Trump\u2019s presidency would bode well for the stock market, earlier this week discussed the market\u2019s reaction when chances of a Kamala Harris win were apparently rising. Looking back at Cramer\u2019s analysis in hindsight gives us a nice overview of what groups of stocks could rise in the coming weeks and months.\nJim Cramer on Monday evening analyzed what caused the market to dip as of the closing session. Cramer believed the chances of Iowa turning blue spooked some market circles on various assumptions:\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the most incredible reactions, the bond market. Interest rates went sharply lower today. Now, see, I\u2019m so used to higher, to interest rates going higher in a Democratic win, that this took me by surprise. It\u2019s completely out of character. But the bond market is steep, and its judgment is not made on a whim. There had to be billions of dollars invested today on rates going lower if Harris wins the election. I find that astonishing.\u201d\nCramer then talked about different groups of stocks that moved based on the sentiment that Harris could win this election. Housing stocks rose because the market is bullish based on potential subsidies if Harris wins. Tech stocks, however, fell, and Cramer explained the reason behind that:\n\u201c(hyper scalers and tech stocks) traded horribly today. What does it say? It says the traders are betting that Harris will stand by Biden\u2019s FTC and antitrust appointments who are known to be anti-the hyper scalers,\u201d Cramer added.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nJim Cramer Says Market is \u2018Underestimating\u2019 Meta Platforms (META)\u2019s Ability to Dominante Ads Market\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nJim Cramer also talked about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s\u00a0latest quarterly results in a recent program on CNBC:\nStory Continues\n\u201cI think everyone\u2019s underestimating their ability to dominate the digital advertising market.\u201d\nCramer lauded Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s\u00a0dominance in the consumer internet and AI space:\n\u201cMost importantly, 500 million people use Meta\u2019s AI platform, and Mark Zuckerberg says it will be the largest of the generative AI platforms by year-end. Meta AI is spectacular; if you haven\u2019t used it, it\u2019s smart and funny.\u201d\nDespite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.\nMeta platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\nAccording to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta\u2019s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), the world\u2019s largest social network, were up this quarter, due to impressive top-line growth of 22% year-over-year and solid forward guidance. Despite its large scale, Meta continues to outgrow the broader digital advertising industry, with better AI-driven content recommendations increasing engagement in products like Instagram Reels, and AI improving ad targeting and conversion rates. Our industry checks have continued to validate advertiser adoption and satisfaction, with improvements in Reels monetization, as well as strong adoption of Advantage+, Meta\u2019s AI-driven service to allocate advertiser budgets across its content surfaces.\nOverall, META ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's November Portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Australia will push ahead with a ban on social media for people aged under 16 despite calls by Meta Platforms Inc. for it to consider shifting responsibility for policing usage to app store operators such as Google and Apple.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly\nKey Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration\nParis Restricts Through Traffic in City Center\nFrom Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Friday that all state and territory leaders had signed on to the plan for age restrictions, with the government ruling out any exceptions for major services such as Facebook, TikTok or X.\nThe legislation will be brought before parliament in the week beginning Nov. 18, with a 12-month gap between when the bill passes and when it takes effect. No information has been provided on what personal information would be required to demonstrate proof of age on social media, or the penalties firms might face for breaching the laws. The government has also not offered an exhaustive list of which platforms are considered social media.\nCommunications Minister Michelle Rowland said that under the new legislation, such services would be labeled as \u201cage-restricted.\u201d The minister said the government would review individual websites and online services to decide whether they fall under the laws, but added that gaming services and messaging apps would likely be exempt.\nAustralia has a history of taking on large technology companies that run social sites, including a push in 2021 to make Meta\u2019s Facebook and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google pay for news content. More recently, the government clashed with Elon Musk\u2019s X Corp. over a failure to remove a video of a terrorist attack in Sydney.\nMeta Regional Policy Director for Australia Mia Garlick said that while the company agrees that young people need to have \u201cage-appropriate experiences\u201d on social media, it\u2019s important to consider how that can be enacted practically.\n\u201cThe challenge is that the technology isn\u2019t quite there yet in terms of having a perfect solution,\u201d Garlick told Australian Broadcasting Corp. Friday. She added that it would be better to have mobile app store providers place age restrictions on their products rather than social media companies.\n\u201cIf every single app is required to implement its own age-appropriate controls, then the burden really is going to fall on young people and parents for each of the different apps that a young person wants to use,\u201d she said.\nStory Continues\nTikTok and X haven\u2019t commented on the age restrictions policy yet. Represents for Apple Inc. and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nAlbanese dismissed Meta\u2019s suggestion, saying he believed the government had got its proposal right and expected there would be opposition to the new laws.\nHe said while the laws were unlikely to completely keep under-16s off online platforms, it would send an important signal.\n\u201cWe ban alcohol for under-18s, for purchasing. Well, this weekend I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be an example of someone under the age of 18 getting access to alcohol,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean that you say, \u2018Oh well it\u2019s all too hard, let it rip.\u2019\u201d\n--With assistance from Newley Purnell.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u2018I\u2019m Suffering\u2019: What the 2024 Election Taught Me About America\nTrump Set to Move Courts Further Right, Deepening Judicial Clout\nWhat Looked Like a Toss-Up Turned Into a Red Wave.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc. is set to unveil a pair of glasses with a built-in AI assistant, putting up a Chinese rival to the Meta Ray-Bans that have proven a rare success in AI-powered hardware.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly\nKey Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration\nParis Restricts Through Traffic in City Center\nFrom Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow\nChina\u2019s search leader and longtime investor in artificial intelligence plans to showcase the product at its annual Baidu World event in Shanghai next week, according to a person familiar with its schedule. The gadget will have built-in cameras to capture photos and video and will support voice interactions built atop Baidu\u2019s Ernie foundation model, the person said, asking not to be named as the glasses are not yet public.\nThe push to monetize AI has found expression in a series of hardware introductions this year, from the Humane Ai Pin flop to Microsoft Corp.\u2019s better-received Copilot+ PC range. The Meta Platforms Inc. smart glasses, designed in collaboration with Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica SA, are an older product that\u2019s grown in features, capabilities and popularity this year. Meta said demand had outpaced its ability to supply new units and EssilorLuxottica has singled them out as a product driving new sales.\nBeijing-based Baidu is likewise working to capitalize on more than a decade of AI development, and its smart glasses will connect to a suite of products such as Baidu Maps and its online encyclopedia, Baike. Sales of the product, which will likely cost less than Meta\u2019s $299, could start as soon as early 2025, the person said.\nA Baidu spokesperson did not respond to an emailed enquiry.\nThe AI glasses have been developed by Baidu\u2019s hardware division, Xiaodu, which in 2020 raised funding from investors including IDG Capital at a value of $2.9 billion. Its key products include voice-activated speakers and wireless earbuds that also connect with Baidu\u2019s content ecosystem.\nDespite a head start in China\u2019s ChatGPT-inspired AI frenzy, Baidu has struggled to hang on to leadership. TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s Doubao has in recent months taken over as China\u2019s most popular AI chatbot, nudging Ernie Bot down in the rankings. Baidu executives have also warned that displaying AI-generated results in the company\u2019s core search business will be a short-term negative to advertising revenue.\nA slew of Chinese upstart hardware makers have introduced AI glasses with cameras and open-ear audio already, while others have focused on narrower functionality like translation and pathfinding. Across the Pacific, Apple Inc. is exploring a push into the category with an internal study of products currently available on the market, Bloomberg News has reported.\nStory Continues\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u2018I\u2019m Suffering\u2019: What the 2024 Election Taught Me About America\nTrump Set to Move Courts Further Right, Deepening Judicial Clout\nWhat Looked Like a Toss-Up Turned Into a Red Wave.

          "whole_article": "We recently made a list of UBS\u2019 Best Stocks In The AI, Growth & Low Rates Era: Top 29 US Stocks. In this piece, we will take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks on the list of the top UBS AI and growth era.\nThe stock market at the tail end of 2024 is an evolution of the patterns we\u2019ve observed since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Back then, technology stocks soared as the demand for tech products rose due to lockdowns and stay-at-home restrictions. Then, as inflation soared and central banks ratcheted up interest rates to tamp it down, the markets tumbled as investors flooded into safe-haven assets and money market securities. Worries of a recession also drove some of the market\u2019s pessimism, with investment banks, economists, and analysts predicting that the economy could experience a sharp downturn.\nNow, as we get ready to welcome 2025, technology and macroeconomic concerns are still driving the market. Since technology is far more interesting and information-heavy, starting with macro is better. On this front, September was a pivotal month for indexes as it finally saw the Federal Reserve deliver a 50 basis point interest rate cut to bring rates down from a 24-year high. Since the interest rate cut, the flagship S&P index, the broader NASDAQ, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ are up by 3.48%, 5.89%, and 5.39%, respectively. This optimism is driven by lighter financing requirements allowing businesses to pursue growth and easing worries of a tight labor market and a potential economic downturn which were at the root of poor market performance on the day the rate cut was made.\nHowever, just because the economic clouds might have dissipated doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve dissolved. The start of October\u2019s final week saw some turbulence across major US stock indexes. The Dow, the flagship S&P, and the broader NASDAQ shed 0.96%, 0.92%, and 1.60%, respectively as investors worried that the Federal Reserve might not keep up the pace with interest rate cuts. The drop came on the back of rising Treasury yields, which typically soar if investors re-calibrate their rate estimates upwards as bonds with lower rates are sold. The turbulence followed after four Federal Reserve officials shared their thoughts on future cuts.\nTheir thoughts reflected a division in policymakers regarding the pace of interest rate cuts. The four officials are Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari. Logan cautioned that while she was willing to reduce rates, two takeaways from the current financial and economic picture were on her mind.\nStory Continues\nShe shared that first \u201cthe economy is strong and stable. But second, meaningful uncertainties remain in the outlook. Downside risks to the labor market have increased, balanced against diminished but still real upside risks to inflation. And many of these risks are complex to assess and measure.\u201d The Dallas Fed President added that \u201cany number of shocks could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move and where rates should settle.\u201d\nFed\u2019s Schmid followed a similar tune. He commented that any rate cuts should be carefully measured to ensure that the Fed did not misinterpret the economy\u2019s reaction. Speaking in Kansas City, the Fed President commented \u201cOutsized policy moves can provoke outsized financial market reactions to data surprises. The data are messy and subject to large revisions as we have seen in recent months. Our policy must be linked to the flow of data, but we should avoid putting too much weight on any single data point. As policymakers we should be flexible, but being nimble can come with a price. Reacting quickly builds expectations of further quick reactions.\u201d Daly shared in a webcast that the current environment \u201cis a very tight interest rate for an economy that already is on the path to 2% inflation, and I don\u2019t want to see the labor market slow further,\u201d while Kashkari stressed the data-dependent decision making at the Fed, with the central bank wanting \u201cto keep the labor market strong and we want to get inflation back down to our 2% target.\u201d\nNaturally, investors were worried that the path to 50 basis point cuts for the rest of 2024 might not be so clear. However, even though rates might be high, the US economy continues to be the star performer globally. As per the IMF, the global economy is expected to grow by 3.2% in 2024 and 2025. This is the latest estimate in October, and the fact that it\u2019s unchanged over the July estimate is solely due to the US. In its October report, the IMF revised US economic growth forecasts for 2024 and 2025 to 2.6% and 2.2%, while economies in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia saw downward revisions. Consequently, robust American economic growth made sure that the global estimates remained unchanged.\nOne major reason behind the bullishness surrounding America is artificial intelligence. Data from Carta shows that it\u2019s not only Wall Street that\u2019s bullish on AI. For the first three quarters of 2024, hardware and software as a service (SaaS) industries raised $7.62 billion and $18.43 billion in primary round startup investment, respectively. This marked 85% and 67% annual growth, and it signifies investors\u2019 push towards technologies that facilitate artificial intelligence.\nThe data comes on the heels of the third quarter earnings season which is also seeing a paradigm shift for the AI industry. So far, investors have been focused on one AI company, the Santa Clara, California-based AI GPU designer whose shares are up 193% year to date. Yet, now, Wall Street is also interested in Phase 2 AI companies. These companies, according to investment bank Goldman Sachs, are those that provide AI infrastructure such as servers, semiconductor companies apart from the GPU designer, and utilities that will power up the gigawatt AI data centers that Silicon Valley has in mind for its AI models. For a detailed view of the latest in the AI industry, you can read Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks.\nAll these factors, from the economy to AI are also on the mind of investment bank UBS. In its latest Equity Compass note, the bank remained bullish on US stocks due to its perception of the current stock market and economic climate. \u201cFrom a single stock perspective, we think many of the large U.S. tech companies offer appealing long-term upside, especially those that have leading positions in the AI value chain,\u201d shared UBS. Shifting the focus to macroeconomics, it outlined \u201cthe combination of slowing but durable economic growth, healthy earnings growth, and continued Fed rate cuts are all supportive,\u201d adding that while \u201ceconomic growth is cooling, the labor market remains healthy. Initial claims for unemployment insurance are fairly low, there are more open jobs than unemployed people, and real wages are rising.\u201d\nThe bank also identified AI as a \u2018most attractive\u2019 thematic investing opportunity. It shares that \u201cThe shift in computing infrastructure, from central processing units to accelerated computing units (GPUs), and in applications, from retrieval-based to generative-based architectures, has far-reaching implications for AI in terms of its generalizability (the ability to make predictions based on past observations) and effectiveness.\u201d As for the potential catalysts, UBS adds that \u201cThe next catalysts we see include potential export controls imposed by the US on China in October and 3Q24 results, where we expect further positive revisions to AI infrastructure capex and more data points on AI adoption across industries.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top US stocks in the AI and growth environment, we first ranked the stock sectors in UBS\u2019 Equity Compass report by the bank\u2019s Neutral, Attractive, and Most Attractive rankings. Then, the stocks within these categories were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q2 2024. The list starts from Neutral and ends at Most Attractive, and the sectors themselves were ranked by the total number of hedge fund investors in the component stocks.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA portfolio manager holding a laptop and looking over a stock market ticker.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 219\nUBS\u2019 Sector Rating: Attractive\nSector: Communications Services\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the firm that owns and operates Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Its user base of 3.2 billion makes it one of the biggest in the world. It also makes Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) indispensable to the global advertising industry, with the firm relying on advertiser revenue for most of its sales. As of H1 2024, 98% of Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) $75.5 billion in revenue came through advertising. Consequently, the firm tends to perform well when economic output is high and businesses have a greater ability to spend on marketing. Additionally, its dominance in the social media industry has lent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) sizable resources of $32 billion in cash and equivalents. These, in turn, have enabled it to establish a foothold in the artificial intelligence industry and develop a foundational AI model. The billions that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has invested in AI mean that generating AI profits is now a key part of its hypothesis. This is through its advertising AI features for businesses, and consumer-facing AI features that involve image editing. Additionally, another central tenet of Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) hypothesis is its AI spending. The more the firm spends, the less money it can allocate for other plans, and investor expectations of a return also grow. This was evident after Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) Q3 earnings that saw shares drop by 3% after it upgraded 2024 CapEx spending to $38 billion to $40 billion from an earlier $37 billion to $40 billion.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMeta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks 4th on our list of UBS' top stocks in the AI and growth era. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

From Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos to Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Satya Nadella and Meta\u2019s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, some of the most powerful names in the tech industry quickly moved to get off on the right foot with the president-elect.\nTrump is entering a tech landscape that\u2019s changed dramatically over the last four years thanks to the rise of generative artificial intelligence.\nTech companies are also staring down a number of antitrust lawsuits that Trump has the power to, if not call off, then at least provide marching orders with regard to potential remedies.\nBig Tech has had an often acrimonious relationship with both the Trump and Biden administrations. After the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, Meta, Twitter, and YouTube banned Trump\u2019s social media accounts, though they\u2019ve each since reinstated them. Trump has an extra distaste for Zuckerberg, going as far as threatening to jail the CEO for life in his book.\nZuckerberg didn\u2019t outright endorse Trump during the lead-up to the election, though during an interview with Bloomberg, he did say that Trump\u2019s reaction to his assassination attempt, raising his fist in the air, was \u201cbadass.\u201d The CEO then added, \u201cOn some level as an American, it\u2019s hard to not get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight, and I think that that\u2019s why a lot of people like the guy.\u201d\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nZuckerberg posted his congratulatory note to Trump on his X competitor Threads, saying he looks forward to working with the Trump administration.\n\u201cWe have great opportunities ahead of us as a country. Looking forward to working with you and your administration,\u201d he wrote.\nBezos also has a difficult relationship with Trump. The Amazon and Blue Origin founder also owns the Washington Post, which Trump has accused of being biased against him. The Post was preparing to endorse Trump\u2019s rival Vice President Kamala Harris for president, but in a stunning move Bezos forced the paper to cancel its plans.\nAs a result, the Post has reportedly lost more than 200,000 subscribers. Bezos then penned an op-ed for the paper saying that the decision to pull the endorsement was a principled one and that backing one candidate creates the perception of bias.\nBut Bezos also lauded Trump\u2019s win on Wednesday, writing, \u201cBig congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s Nadella and Apple\u2019s Cook also offered their congratulations to Trump, with both CEOs saying that they look forward to engaging with the president-elect and his administration. Microsoft and Apple have had relatively good relationships with Trump over the years and have avoided much of the problems that Zuckerberg and Bezos have faced.\nStory Continues\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai also congratulated Trump on his \u201cdecisive\u201d victory, adding that the US is in a \u201cgolden age of American innovation\u201d and that Google is committed to working with Trump\u2019s administration.\nTrump has criticized Google over the years for displaying negative articles about him in search results, most recently telling Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait that he called \u201cthe head of Google\u201d about not seeing enough positive stories about him.\nNvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Jensen Huang, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t said anything about the election, choosing to stay impartial even when the issue has come up during press interviews. Huang isn\u2019t active on social media either, making it easier to avoid having to make any statements related to the broader political environment.\nAMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su has also avoided the election despite having a public X profile. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, on the other hand, congratulated Trump on his win.\nGelsinger\u2019s Intel (INTC) is working to ensure it gets its promised share of billions of dollars from the CHIPS Act, one of the Biden administration\u2019s hallmark pieces of bipartisan legislation meant to bring chip manufacturing back to the US.\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson threw the fate of the CHIPS Act into question earlier this week, saying he would repeal the legislation before quickly walking his statement back.\nWith Trump now set to be sworn in come January, the CEOs will have to hope that their early well wishes will pay dividends over the next four years.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe extent to which AI tech may disrupt life as we know it in the coming years is still shrouded in mystery. However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThis number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report.\u00a0 The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nMeanwhile, the former tech darling Intel (INTC), which Nvidia replaced in the Dow, has fallen nearly 50% since the beginning of 2024 as investors grow wary of its ongoing production issues and gloomy financials and question whether its turnaround plan will succeed.\nIn Trump's second term, Nvidia, like the rest of the AI chip market, could face hurdles in the form of high tariffs on Chinese goods and heightened trade tensions. The president-elect has suggested imposing 10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on imports from China \u2014 levels unseen since the Great Depression. Nvidia manufactures its chips in Taiwan with TSMC (TSMC34.SA), which uses components from China to make those chips.\n\"Trump's victory brings further uncertainty to the semiconductor sector in terms of its impact on additional China restrictions, higher tariffs, and CHIPS Act funding,\" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note Friday.\n\u201cDisruptions to the global supply chain would be a problem for NVIDIA because they'd be a problem for TSMC,\u201d D.A.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss.\nThere has been a lot of buzz around AI startups in the past few years, with funding rounds fetching hundreds of millions of dollars and valuations climbing to record highs. For example, OpenAI, of ChatGPT-fame, has become the most valuable private company in the world with a value of over $150 billion in the past few weeks. No other tech startup in the history of the United States has ever been this valuable before a public offering. This valuation is a reflection of the boundless potential of AI. Latest reports, published by news agency Reuters, reveal that the startup is presently involved in talks with authorities in California, where it is based, over a change in business structure that will allow it to become a for-profit business.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nIn 2015, OpenAI was founded as a non-profit AI research lab. The shift towards the for-profit tag is likely to make the company even more attractive to investors. OpenAI has many big tech names among investors, including giants like Microsoft. Reports suggest that since the first billion it invested in the startup back in 2019, the tech giant has invested another $12 billion in the AI firm, bringing total investments in the startup to around $13 billion. The extensive capital spending has led to concerns about threats to fat margins at the company and added pressure on profitability. Market intelligence firm Visible Alpha estimates that the tech giant\u2019s capital spending for a single quarter now is more than its annual expenditure used to be until fiscal 2020.\nREAD ALSO: 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's November Portfolio.\nStock markets are roaring amid Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Jim Cramer, who has long believed that Trump\u2019s presidency would bode well for the stock market, earlier this week discussed the market\u2019s reaction when chances of a Kamala Harris win were apparently rising. Looking back at Cramer\u2019s analysis in hindsight gives us a nice overview of what groups of stocks could rise in the coming weeks and months.\nJim Cramer on Monday evening analyzed what caused the market to dip as of the closing session. Cramer believed the chances of Iowa turning blue spooked some market circles on various assumptions:\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the most incredible reactions, the bond market. Interest rates went sharply lower today. Now, see, I\u2019m so used to higher, to interest rates going higher in a Democratic win, that this took me by surprise. It\u2019s completely out of character. But the bond market is steep, and its judgment is not made on a whim. There had to be billions of dollars invested today on rates going lower if Harris wins the election. I find that astonishing.\u201d\nCramer then talked about different groups of stocks that moved based on the sentiment that Harris could win this election. Housing stocks rose because the market is bullish based on potential subsidies if Harris wins. Tech stocks, however, fell, and Cramer explained the reason behind that:\n\u201c(hyper scalers and tech stocks) traded horribly today. What does it say? It says the traders are betting that Harris will stand by Biden\u2019s FTC and antitrust appointments who are known to be anti-the hyper scalers,\u201d Cramer added.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nJim Cramer Admits Apple (AAPL) is a \u2018Changing Story\u2019\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nStory Continues\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0results and admitted that iPhones will no longer be the centerpiece of the stock\u2019s thesis in the future:\n\u201cAnd they gave us a guide down. Even as I say own it, don\u2019t trade it, I recognize the consensus going into next quarter was 6.8% growth, which was not going to be met. I told you this repeatedly; I told you that it was way too high. I said the stock would go down. Apple\u2019s looking for low to mid single-digit growth now. It\u2019s exactly as I said. But to me, Apple\u2019s a changing story. It\u2019s going to be less about the release of the iPhone and more about the software.\u201d\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently posted decent quarterly results but concerns remain around its iPhone 16 sales and growth. Analysts are deeply divided on this stock. Morgan Stanley recently called Apple\u2019s current position \u201cchallenging,\u201d with KeyBanc and TF International Securities expressing concerns over iPhone sales volume. KeyBanc downgraded Apple to \u201cunderweight\u201d with a $200 price target. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives remains bullish, reiterating his view that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) could reach a $4 trillion market cap.\nRecently, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reclaimed a top-5 position in China\u2019s smartphone market, its 15.6% market share is still down from last year, especially against Huawei, which surged with over 40% growth. Xiaomi also continues to challenge Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s competitive edge. Notably, the iPhone 16 had only about three weeks of Q3 sales, yet didn\u2019t lift Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s market share for the quarter, despite expectations for initial sales to be strong.\nIn the latest earnings call, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook highlighted new features for the iPhone, such as a more comfortable watch band and sleep apnea detection, but none appeared to be major demand drivers for new customers.\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance as investors continued to favorably discount the recent unveiling of its AI strategy. As we have noted in the past, the Company has been at the forefront of proprietary semiconductor computer processor development for well over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. Apple\u2019s AI value proposition should compel consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's November Portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

From Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos to Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Satya Nadella and Meta\u2019s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, some of the most powerful names in the tech industry quickly moved to get off on the right foot with the president-elect.\nTrump is entering a tech landscape that\u2019s changed dramatically over the last four years thanks to the rise of generative artificial intelligence.\nTech companies are also staring down a number of antitrust lawsuits that Trump has the power to, if not call off, then at least provide marching orders with regard to potential remedies.\nBig Tech has had an often acrimonious relationship with both the Trump and Biden administrations. After the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, Meta, Twitter, and YouTube banned Trump\u2019s social media accounts, though they\u2019ve each since reinstated them. Trump has an extra distaste for Zuckerberg, going as far as threatening to jail the CEO for life in his book.\nZuckerberg didn\u2019t outright endorse Trump during the lead-up to the election, though during an interview with Bloomberg, he did say that Trump\u2019s reaction to his assassination attempt, raising his fist in the air, was \u201cbadass.\u201d The CEO then added, \u201cOn some level as an American, it\u2019s hard to not get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight, and I think that that\u2019s why a lot of people like the guy.\u201d\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nZuckerberg posted his congratulatory note to Trump on his X competitor Threads, saying he looks forward to working with the Trump administration.\n\u201cWe have great opportunities ahead of us as a country. Looking forward to working with you and your administration,\u201d he wrote.\nBezos also has a difficult relationship with Trump. The Amazon and Blue Origin founder also owns the Washington Post, which Trump has accused of being biased against him. The Post was preparing to endorse Trump\u2019s rival Vice President Kamala Harris for president, but in a stunning move Bezos forced the paper to cancel its plans.\nAs a result, the Post has reportedly lost more than 200,000 subscribers. Bezos then penned an op-ed for the paper saying that the decision to pull the endorsement was a principled one and that backing one candidate creates the perception of bias.\nBut Bezos also lauded Trump\u2019s win on Wednesday, writing, \u201cBig congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s Nadella and Apple\u2019s Cook also offered their congratulations to Trump, with both CEOs saying that they look forward to engaging with the president-elect and his administration. Microsoft and Apple have had relatively good relationships with Trump over the years and have avoided much of the problems that Zuckerberg and Bezos have faced.\nStory Continues\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai also congratulated Trump on his \u201cdecisive\u201d victory, adding that the US is in a \u201cgolden age of American innovation\u201d and that Google is committed to working with Trump\u2019s administration.\nTrump has criticized Google over the years for displaying negative articles about him in search results, most recently telling Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait that he called \u201cthe head of Google\u201d about not seeing enough positive stories about him.\nNvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Jensen Huang, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t said anything about the election, choosing to stay impartial even when the issue has come up during press interviews. Huang isn\u2019t active on social media either, making it easier to avoid having to make any statements related to the broader political environment.\nAMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su has also avoided the election despite having a public X profile. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, on the other hand, congratulated Trump on his win.\nGelsinger\u2019s Intel (INTC) is working to ensure it gets its promised share of billions of dollars from the CHIPS Act, one of the Biden administration\u2019s hallmark pieces of bipartisan legislation meant to bring chip manufacturing back to the US.\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson threw the fate of the CHIPS Act into question earlier this week, saying he would repeal the legislation before quickly walking his statement back.\nWith Trump now set to be sworn in come January, the CEOs will have to hope that their early well wishes will pay dividends over the next four years.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThis number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report.\u00a0 The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Latest reports, published by news website The Information, claim that the tech giant is considering an additional investment in Anthropic, the generative AI startup. Earlier this year, Amazon had announced plans to invest up to $4 billion into the AI startup. The Information reported that the latest investment could also be in multi billion dollars. Anthropic, which has developed one of the most famous AI training models worldwide, might have to use servers powered by AI chips developed by Amazon if this latest round of investment talks bear fruit, per the news outlet.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Lowe\u2019s LOW comes out a week later on Tuesday, November 19th.\nLowe\u2019s shares have outperformed Home Depot this year (+21.6% vs. +16.8%), though both have lagged the Zacks Construction sector (+26.4%) as well as the S&P 500 index (+25.7%), as the chart below shows.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe operating environment for Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s remains difficult, as the interest rate backdrop continues to be unfavorable despite the U.S. Fed\u2019s easing policy. The strength in treasury yields in recent weeks likely reflected the bond market\u2019s early read on the U.S. elections and the incoming administration\u2019s pro-growth policy posture.\nWith the Fed on track to continue easing, as reconfirmed by the Fed Chair\u2019s press conference, investors would expect treasury yields to eventually come down. That said, the yield curve is unlikely to shift down in parallel, with the shorter end of the curve reflecting the central bank\u2019s easing policy and the longer end proving to be somewhat \u2018sticky\u2019 to reflect expectations of a more robust growth environment.\nThe read-through for Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s of this interest rate discussion is that mortgage rates may not come down as much or as fast as would typically be expected in a Fed easing cycle. What this means is that trends in the existing home sales space are unlikely to meaningfully improve over the near term, though one would expect the medium- to long-term outlook on the existing home sales front to be positive on economic and demographic grounds.\nWe don\u2019t expect any major surprises in Home Depot\u2019s Q3 results, though the numbers may have benefited on the margin from the active storm activity in the U.S. Southeast. The expectation is for Home Depot\u2019s Q3 earnings to be down -5% from the year-earlier level on +4.1% higher revenues. Estimates for the period are down from three months back, reflecting management\u2019s guidance following the August 13th quarterly report, but they have modestly ticked up in recent days.\nWith respect to the\nRetail sector\u2019s 2024 Q3 earnings season scorecard\n, we now have results from 23 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 23 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q3 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.\nTotal Q3 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +17.3% from the same period last year on +6.3% higher revenues, with 52.2% beating EPS estimates and 47.8% beating revenue estimates.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators have struggled to beat EPS and revenue estimates in Q3. In fact, the Q3 EPS beats percentage for these players represents a new low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years), while the revenue beats percentage is only modestly above the 20-quarter low and significantly below the 20-quarter average.\nConcerning the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 23 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +71.6% on +11% higher revenues, beating EPS and revenue expectations.\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar retail spaces have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart remaining a growing online vendor. As we will see in the days ahead, as Walmart releases quarterly results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player, thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon\u2019s results (left side chart) and without Amazon\u2019s numbers (right side chart)\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, all of the earnings growth at this stage for the Retail sector is coming from Amazon, with Q3 earnings for the rest of the group that have reported down -10.4% on +3.8% higher revenues. You can see that the top-line growth effectively reflects headline inflationary trends in the economy.\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nThrough Friday, November 8th, we have seen Q3 results from 452 S&P 500 members, or 90.4% of the index\u2019s total membership. We have another 9 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week, including Disney, Applied Materials, Shopify, Home Depot, and others.\nTotal earnings for these 452 companies that have reported are up +7.1% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 73.5% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.5% beating revenue estimates.\nThe proportion of these 452 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 50.7%.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. The first set of comparison charts show the earnings and revenue growth rates.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe second set of comparison charts compare the Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below spotlight the revenue performance and the blended beats percentage for this group of 452 index members.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the growth trend appears to be stable-to-positive, though fewer companies are able to beat consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter averages for this group of companies.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues.\nThe chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.\nHad it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +9.9% instead of +7.4%. Excluding the Tech sector\u2019s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be up only +2.6% instead of +7.4%.\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +2.1% instead of +7.4%.\nFor the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.1% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues.\nUnlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better, as the chart below shows.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with the +7.9% earnings growth this year followed by double-digit gains in 2025 and 2026.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +7.9% earnings growth improves to +9.8% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Breaking Down the Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best internet retail stocks to buy now.\nWhat\u2019s Happening In The Internet Retail Sector?\nAccording to a report published by FTI Consulting, the United States e-commerce is experiencing a revival after a period of stagnation post-COVID. After 18 months of slow growth, e-commerce sales began to pick up again in early 2023 as consumers resumed shopping habits that had been altered during the pandemic. The report notes that e-commerce sales growth represented 46% of total retail sales growth in 2023 and surged to 57% in the first quarter of 2024, marking its highest contribution since 2017, excluding pandemic spikes.\nConsumers have adopted the trend of shopping online as despite the reopening of physical stores, many consumers continue to prefer online shopping. The report indicates that foot traffic in stores remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, with many Americans choosing to shop online rather than visit physical locations. This shift suggests a long-term change in consumer behavior, as evidenced by ongoing declines in in-store visits and increased e-commerce market share.\nTalking about the pandemic era from 2020 to 2022 total retail sales in the United States (excluding auto and gas) increased by 31%, compared to only 12.2% from 2017 to 2019. The report suggests this translates to an additional $1.9 trillion in retail spending above pre-COVID norms. This increased spending benefited the e-commerce segment as it was able to capture 87% of the increase in total retail spending during the height of the pandemic lockdowns.\nLooking forward, the United States\u2019 e-commerce sales are projected to grow at a sustainable rate of high to mid-single digits annually. This is a significant slowdown from the mid-teens growth rates seen before COVID but still sufficient for continued market share gains against traditional retail channels.\nMoreover, the report also highlighted that newcomers including Temu, Shein, and TikTok Shop are entering the US e-commerce market. These newcomers are disrupting the established players through a strategy of becoming low-cost retailers. For instance, Temu achieved $14 billion in global gross merchandise value (GMV) sales in 2023 and is targeting $30 billion for 2024. On the other hand, Shein captured 40% of the fast fashion market domestically and had an estimated global GMV of $42 billion in 2023. Moreover, TikTok Shop was launched in 2023 and is aiming for $50 billion in global e-commerce sales by 2024.\nStory Continues\nThe report suggests that while these platforms may attract budget-conscious consumers, they may not significantly threaten established e-commerce giant\u2019s dominance due to perceived differences in product quality and brand positioning.\nLooking ahead as per FTI Consulting the US online retail sales are expected to hit $1.2 trillion in 2024 translating to a 9.8% increase year-over-year. Moreover, the e-commerce market share is also expected to increase from 21.6% in 2023 to 22.7% by the end of the current year.\nMoreover, some of the key trends identified by the reports are a sharp increase in the closing of physical retail stores due to increased labor costs, rents, and the feasibility of selling online. In addition to this, another key trend is the use of artificial intelligence among internet retailers, which helps engage with customers more closely and enables a personalized shopping experience.\nWe have also covered the\u00a07 Best E-commerce Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the article:\n\u201cE-commerce is growing faster than expected and as new avenues of selling online open up, companies are bound to keep up with trends and innovative strategies. According to a report by Forbes, the e-commerce industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $7.9 trillion by 2027 from $6.3 trillion in 2024. In 2027, 23% of retail purchases are expected to be made online, up from 20.1% in 2024.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of 10 best internet retail stocks to buy now we used the Finviz stock screener. Using the screener, we shortlisted the internet retail stocks by their market capitalization. Next we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 hedge funds database to rank the stocks by the number of hedge fund holders.

During the third quarter, the free cash flow grew 123% year-over-year.\nApart from lucrative cash flow generating capabilities one of the competitive edge that the company holds is its progress with artificial intelligence.

The business has been concentrating on creating increasingly sophisticated processors to satisfy the rising market for artificial intelligence uses. Indicating a greater need for sophisticated, energy-efficient processors vital for AI technology, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, asked SK Hynix to accelerate the production of its HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chips by six months in November 2024.\nSignificantly investing in OpenAI, Microsoft has been implementing OpenAI's ideas into its goods and services. Microsoft and OpenAI were debating in October about how Microsoft's $14 billion investment would turn into stock when OpenAI moves into a for-profit company. This change is likely to affect the dynamics of the AI sector as well as the alliances among its companies.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Appealing to people\u2019s most basic needs such as their personal finances has clearly been a winning strategy, and if the results can be delivered, Trump will likely remain popular with those who voted for him.\nAlthough it is early days, and we can\u2019t know exactly what policies will be passed by Trump, it is likely that we will see some sort of tax cuts for corporations and individuals as well as an easing of business regulations. These were strategies he implemented in his previous term with notable impact, and he\u2019s likely to apply them again.\nWhat this means is that the average American citizen is going to have a few extra dollars in their pocket at the end of every month. That money will either get invested into the stock market or get spent on discretionary purchases.

But with this additional catalyst of a strong consumer, it goes straight to the top of my must own stock list.\nAfter spending the past few months trading mostly sideways since spring, AMZN shares have soared to new all-time highs in response to the election results, breaking out of their recent stagnation. And not only can Amazon expect growth from consumer spending, but its cloud services business is an absolute juggernaut, spewing cash thanks to the AI boom. AWS remains the world\u2019s leading cloud computing business with 31% market share.\nFurthermore, Amazon currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings estimates have risen by 8.8% in the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have also jumped by 8.8%. Amazon is expected to grow its earnings per share by a very impressive 28.3% annually over the next three to five years, bolstered not only by its e-commerce business, but also by its cloud computing segment AWS.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHome Depot: Shares Breakout Following Election\nHome Depot is another favored place for cash-flush consumers to spend. With the rise in work from home arrangements, people are making improvements to their homes more than ever. Furthermore, millennials are finally breaking into home ownership and have shown a surprising ability to earn and build wealth. As older homes scooped up and taken off the market these new buyers are likely to be making improvements to their new abodes.\nLike Amazon, Home Depot also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings growth forecasts are a bit more tepid than Amazon\u2019s, with projections of 9.6% annual growth over the next three to five years. However, as investors recognize these new growth catalysts, we may see that number rise even more.\nEspecially appealing is the developments in Home Depot\u2019s stock price action. After forming a clear bull flag over the last several weeks, HD shares have staged a clear breakout this morning, signaling that higher prices may be imminent. So long as the stock continues to trade above the breakout level, I would expect the stock to continue its march higher.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy Shares in AMZN and HD?\nAs we assess the potential impacts of a Trump presidency on the economy, it\u2019s clear that the policies historically associated with his administration could benefit stocks in consumer-driven sectors. With an approach that tends to focus on tax cuts, reduced regulation, and a business-friendly environment, companies like Amazon and Home Depot stand well-positioned to capitalize on potential boosts in consumer spending.\nBoth Amazon and Home Depot stocks align well with a Trump-influenced economic strategy, offering attractive opportunities for investors seeking exposure to sectors set to benefit from a stronger U.S. consumer. Investors considering AMZN or HD may find both stocks appealing for their strong fundamentals and current momentum.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "In an effort to stymie bureaucracy at Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy in mid-September announced a plan to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.\nThis largely has to do with Amazon\u2019s disdain for inefficiency and having too many stakeholders involved in decision-making.\n\u201cThe reality is that the [senior leadership] team and I hate bureaucracy,\" Jassy said during an internal call this week, the same meeting where he addressed employee questions about Amazon\u2019s strict return-to-work policy, a spokesperson confirmed to Fortune. \"One of the reasons I'm still at this company is because it's not a political or bureaucratic place.\"\nThe Amazon spokesperson told Fortune this effort isn\u2019t necessarily meant to reduce the number of managers; rather, it\u2019s meant to lessen the number of layers between employees and leadership. This decision comes in the aftermath of Amazon\u2019s massive hiring spree since the pandemic.\nTo increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers, Amazon is exploring growing team sizes and having managers take on other roles, the spokesperson said.\nJassy and his senior leadership team are hot on the trail to lessen bureaucracy at Amazon\u2014so much, in fact, they introduced a \u201cbureaucracy mailbox,\u201d where employees can submit concerns about excessive processes or rules to be addressed, according to Business Insider. Jassy has already received more than 500 emails, and the company has acted on about 150 of them.\nIs it a good idea for Amazon increase its employee to manager ratio? Experts weigh in\nReducing the number of managers\u2014especially at a company as big as Amazon\u2014can be a slippery slope, management experts agree.\n\u201cLarger companies need some bureaucracy to control and coordinate their operations,\u201d Moshe Cohen, a senior lecturer on management and organizations at Boston University\u2019s Questrom School of Business, told Fortune. \u201cToo little management results in chaos, poor coordination, inferior decisions, and too little attention to team members.\u201d\nHowever, Cohen agreed too much bureaucracy can slow decision-making and disconnect people from a company\u2019s mission. \u201cThe challenge is to find the right balance and to structure the management to optimize the positives without burdening the organization or its people,\u201d he added.\nLoren Margolis, founder and chief executive coach of TLS Leaders and leadership professor at Stony Brook University, said there are only two conditions under which Amazon should consider having fewer managers. The first is if managers are underperforming, which includes micromanaging, not coaching, or not empowering employees to do their jobs independently, she told Fortune. The other condition under which Amazon should consider cutting management positions would be if it needs to cut costs and eliminate some layers to be more agile.\nStory Continues\nHowever, Margolis advises against reducing middle-management positions just to cut some red tape.\n\u201cCompanies need to be keenly aware that eliminating middle managers can leave the company without important knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cMiddle managers are the key to a company's success since they empower the front line and support the senior line.\u201d\nMargolis suggests current Amazon employees concerned about their managers losing their jobs to ask as much as they can about processes, key decisions, and influential leaders at the company.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) so let's look a bit deeper.\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.14 = US$61b \u00f7 (US$585b - US$161b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nTherefore, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 14%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 13%.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\nroce\nIn the above chart we have measured Amazon.com's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon.com for free.\nWhat Can We Tell From Amazon.com's ROCE Trend?\nThe trends we've noticed at Amazon.com are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 14%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 233%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\nOur Take On Amazon.com's ROCE\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that Amazon.com is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 142% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Amazon.com can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

          "whole_article": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Amazon (AMZN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AMZN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nAmazon's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Amazon's main business drivers.\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\n\nIts online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company\u2019s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish footprint in physical grocery supermarket space.\nAmazon also enjoys dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin generating businesses.\nAmazon has also become a household name with its Alexa powered Echo devices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa is helping the company sell products and services.\nRevenues were $574.8 billion in 2023. The company reports revenue under three broad heads\u2014North America, International and AWS, which generated 61.4%, 22.8% and 15.8% of total revenues, respectively.\nHeadquartered in Seattle, WA, Amazon targets three categories of customers\u2014consumers, sellers and website developers. Consumers are offered variety, convenience and free delivery of goods displayed on the company\u2019s websites.\n\nThe agreements with sellers are varied, enabling them to use the company\u2019s websites to either sell their merchandise directly, or redirect customers to the sellers\u2019 own branded websites. In case of the latter arrangement, Amazon earns a fee for the sales thus generated.\nCompetition comes in the form of traditional retailers, other online retailers, media companies, web portals, search engines, e-commerce companies and cloud computing service providers.\nBottom Line\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Amazon ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nStory Continues\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in November 2014 would be worth $14,009.87, or a gain of 1,300.99%, as of November 8, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 gained 193.96% and the price of gold went up 120.99% over the same time frame.\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for AMZN.\nAmazon\u2019s third-quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. The stock has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon\u2019s expanding global presence remains a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. The company issued positive Q4 2024 guidance fueling investor enthusiasm. However, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\nShares have gained 12.54% over the past four weeks and there have been 15 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

          "whole_article": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Netflix (NFLX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NFLX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nNetflix's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Netflix's main business drivers.\nNetflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. The company evolved from a small DVD-rental provider to a dominant streaming service provider, courtesy of its wide-ranging content portfolio and a fortified international footprint. At the end of the second quarter of 2024, the company had 277.65 million paid subscribers globally.\n\nNetflix has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping the company sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix streams movies, television shows and documentaries across a wide variety of genres and languages. Domestic and international subscribers can watch them on a host of internet-connected devices, including television sets, computers, and mobile devices.\n\nThe Los Gatos, CA-based company reported revenues of $33.72 billion in 2023.\n\nBeginning fourth-quarter 2019, Netflix started declaring revenues and membership data by regions \u2014 the Asia Pacific (APAC); Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Latin America (LATAM); and the United States and Canada (UCAN).\n\nUCAN accounted for 44.9% of second-quarter 2024 revenues. At the end of the quarter, the company had 84.11 million paid subscribers in the region.\n\nEMEA accounted for 31.5% of second-quarter 2024 revenues. Netflix had 93.96 million paid subscribers in the region at the end of the quarter.\n\nLATAM contributed 12.6% of second-quarter 2024 revenues and had 49.25 million paid subscribers in the region at the end of the quarter.\n\nAPAC accounted for 11% of second-quarter 2024 revenues. The company had 50.23 million paid subscribers in the region at the end of the quarter.\nBottom Line\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Netflix, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\nStory Continues\nA $1000 investment made in November 2014 would be worth $14,248.59, or a 1,324.86% gain, as of November 7, 2024, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 191.90% and gold's return of 117.49% over the same time frame.\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for NFLX.\nNetflix\u2019s third-quarter 2024 results benefited from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention. The planned launch of an in-house ad tech platform in 2025 signals Netflix's commitment to maximizing this new revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year in 2025. Netflix has raised its guidance for the full year 2024, projecting revenue growth at the high end of its previous 14-15% range. Shares have outperformed the industry year to date. However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ is a headwind. NFLX\u2019s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.\nShares have gained 7.26% over the past four weeks and there have been 12 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

However, industry players such as Netflix, Fox, Roku and TEGNA are reaping the benefits of a massive spike in digital content consumption. These companies are thriving due to their diverse content offerings, which include original, regional, and short-form content tailored for small screens like smartphones and tablets.\nImproved Internet speed and penetration, coupled with technological advancements, have been advantageous for industry participants. As monetization and revenues from advertising spending continue to be modest, strategies focused on profit protection, cash management and greater technology integration have gained significance and are expected to aid these companies in driving top-line growth in the near term.\nIndustry Description\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry encompasses companies that provide entertainment, sports, news, non-fiction, and musical content across television, radio, and digital media platforms. These entities generate revenues through the sale of television and radio programs, advertising slots and subscriptions. With technological advancements and a growing demand for virtual reality and Internet radio, industry players are increasing their investments in research and development, as well as sales and marketing efforts, to remain competitive.\nThe industry's focus is likely to shift toward sustaining current levels of operations, coupled with a renewed emphasis on flexibility. This approach would accelerate the transition to a variable cost model, thereby reducing fixed costs and enhancing agility in the face of evolving market dynamics.\n4 Broadcast Radio and Television Industry Trends to Watch\nShift in Consumer Preference a Key Catalyst: To adapt to the evolving landscape, companies are diversifying their content offerings for over-the-top (OTT) services alongside traditional linear TV. The availability of streaming services across a wide range of platforms has enabled them to reach a global audience, expand their international user base and attract advertisers to their platforms, thereby boosting ad revenues.\nThe utilization of services that aid advertisers in measuring their return on investment (ROI) and enhancing use cases is expected to benefit industry participants. Major leagues and events, such as the NFL, NHL, Olympics, European Games, EPL and elections, also contribute significantly to ad revenue generation.\nStory Continues\nIncreased Digital Viewing Fuels Content Demand: Many industry participants, either launching their own OTT services or acquiring existing ones, leverage user insights to deliver tailored content. The surge in digital viewing has made consumer data readily available, allowing companies to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques to create or procure targeted content. This approach not only boosts user engagement but also enables industry players to raise the prices of their services at opportune moments without the fear of losing subscribers.\nUncertain Macroeconomic Landscape Impedes Production and Ad Demand: Advertising is a significant revenue source for the Broadcast Radio and Television industry. However, industry participants are grappling with the effects of persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, increased capital costs, a soaring U.S. dollar and the looming threat of a recession. These factors have prompted advertisers to trim their ad budgets, which is expected to impact the top-line growth of industry players in the near term. Moreover, intense competition for ad dollars from tech and social media companies has been a significant impediment to the growth of industry participants.\nLow-Priced Skinny Bundles Impact Revenues: The surge in cord-cutting has compelled industry participants to offer \"skinny bundles.\" These Internet-based services often contain fewer channels than traditional subscriptions and are, therefore, more affordable. This move aligns with changing consumer viewing dynamics, as growth in Internet penetration and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have boosted small-screen viewing. While these alternative services are expected to keep users engaged with their platforms, increasing the need for additional content, the low-priced skinny bundles are likely to dampen the top-line performance of industry players.\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #184, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\nThe industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. Since Nov. 30, 2023, the industry's earnings estimates for 2024 have moved down 94.7%.\nDespite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching, as these have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But before we present such stocks, it is worth first looking at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation.\nIndustry Beats Sector, S&P 500\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500 Index in the past year.\nThe industry has gained 42.4% over this period compared with the S&P 500's rise of 30.7% and the broader sector's increase of 14.9%.\nIndustry's Current Valuation\nOn the basis of trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Broadcast Radio and Television stocks, the industry is currently trading at 13.32X versus the S&P 500's 17.09X and the sector's 9.9X.\nIn the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.76X and as low as 9.3X, recording a median of 4.61X.\n4 Broadcast Radio and Television Stocks to Watch\nNetflix: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been benefiting from its growing subscriber base thanks to a robust content portfolio and revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password-sharing and ad-supported tier. It has also hiked the prices of certain subscription plans. At the end of the third quarter, Netflix had 282.72 million paid subscribers across more than 190 countries globally, up 14.4% year over year. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nNetflix's diversified content portfolio, backed by heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content, has been driving its growth prospects. Netflix's sprawling games portfolio is also expected to boost user engagement in the near term.\nNetflix now projects revenues to grow 15% year over year in 2024, at the high end of the company's prior expectation of 14-15% growth. For 2025, based on F/X rates as of Sept. 30, 2024, Netflix expects revenues of $43-$44 billion, indicating growth of 11-13% from 2024 revenue guidance of $38.9 billion. Netflix expects revenue growth to be driven by a healthy increase in paid memberships and ARM. Netflix is seeing significant growth in its advertising business, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year over year in 2025.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has moved north by 3.7% to $19.78 per share in the past 30 days. NFLX's shares have returned 56.9% year to date.\nRoku: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from increased user engagement on The Roku Channel and the popularity of the Roku TV program. The Roku Channel remained the #3 app on Roku's platform in the third quarter in terms of reach and engagement, with streaming hours up nearly 80% year over year.\nIn the third quarter, the Roku operating system (OS) was again the #1 selling TV OS in the United States, with TV unit sales greater than the next two TV operating systems combined. The Roku OS was also the #1 selling TV OS in Mexico and Canada.\nStreaming Households were 85.5 million, representing a net increase of 2 million from the second quarter of 2024. The Roku Home Screen, which is the beginning of viewers' streaming experience, reaches U.S. households with more than 120 million people every day, reflecting greater engagement and more monetization opportunities. The launch of third-party streaming channels, including Peacock, Disney+ and HBO Max, is aiding user growth. These services have done well on the Roku platform owing to its large base of engaged users and promotional capabilities.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ROKU's 2024 loss has narrowed by 34 cents to $1.10 per share in the past 30 days. The stock has lost 24% year to date.\nFox: The company is riding on the growing demand for live programming. The robust adoption of Fox News and Fox Business Network is expected to drive the user base in the near term. The company is benefiting from the launch of Tubi in the United Kingdom, which has a vast library of more than 20,000 movies and TV episodes on demand.\nThis Zacks Rank #3 company generates a significant portion of advertising revenues from live programming, which is relatively immune to the rapidly intensifying competition from subscription-based video-on-demand services. The company has expanded its partnership with The Trade Desk to bring best-in-class innovation to advertisers to help them reach their audiences and measure campaign performance to meet their business objectives. Moreover, recovering ad spending in the local advertising market is a major positive for Fox. Also, increasing affiliate-fee revenues are expected to drive Fox's top line.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fox's fiscal 2025 earnings has moved north by a penny to $3.70 per share in the past 30 days. The stock is up 46.9% year to date.\nTEGNA: It has evolved as one of the largest U.S. broadcasting groups and a leading local news and media content provider, thanks to a plethora of acquisitions. TEGNA's portfolio of NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX stations operate under long-term affiliation agreements. The television stations sell available commercial advertising spots as well as produce local programming, such as news, sports, and entertainment. TEGNA carries a Zacks Rank #3 currently.\nTEGNA's focus on content creation rather than TV broadcasting lowers the risk of the cord-cutting threat that is affecting the U.S. Pay-TV industry. Live event programming, which remains the most-watched content for viewers, can be sold either to TV channels, websites or streaming services. Additionally, the company has been investing in digital initiatives and streaming services, potentially opening up new revenue streams.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has remained steady at $3.07 per share in the past 30 days. TGNA's shares have gained 5% year to date.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nJoin us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

          "whole_article": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\nAnother four-year stay at the White House confirmed.\nFormer President Donald Trump has won a second term as president of the United States after a strong showing at the polls. He will be the nation\u2019s 47th president.\nImportantly, Trump won the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. A confirmed win in Wisconsin \u2014 another swing state \u2014 put Trump over the top, with 277 electoral college votes as of early Wednesday.\nRepublicans are also set to take control of the Senate for the first time in four years following key wins in West Virginia and Ohio. Control of the House remained in the balance on Wednesday afternoon.\n\u2022 USD\n(^DJI)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) skyrocketed more than 1,300 points to a record 43,569 by midday as investors raced to price in tax cuts, among other policies Trump has floated. Strong gains were also notched on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).\n\"I don't know that it's too much too soon,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). \"If you think about it coming into this [election], there was a real contention between the [outcomes]. So once you gain some clarity, and it looks like this won't extend or be a contested election, there's a relief rally.\"\nTrump's round two has unleashed a host of key trades too.\nTesla stock (TSLA) surged 14% to $286 during the session. The company's ticker page was the most active on Yahoo Finance through midday.\nThe win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the pole position to shape electric vehicles' future given his strong backing of Trump.\n\u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years,\u201d Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a client note.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) prices are also moving higher, with Trump promising during his campaign to make the US a digital currency superpower. The move also likely reflects an investor bet on an SEC shakeup that could result in a more digital asset-friendly chairman.\n\u2022 USD\n(BTC-USD)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n\u201cWith Trump leading the US presidential race and GOP likely to flip the Senate, we believe the regulatory headwind for crypto has turned into a tailwind and the market is nowhere close to factoring in this shift,\u201d Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said.\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, the 10-year Treasury is climbing. Pros believe Trump\u2019s desire to jack up tariffs on imports and cut taxes could push up inflation, which could reduce the pace of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\"Overall though we think that a Trump win means higher inflation in the near-term versus the status quo with Harris, but slower growth (potentially shaving up to 0.5pp off of GDP in 2025 and 2026),\" TD\u2019s head of global strategy Rich Kelley wrote. \"For FOMC policy, we think the Fed will continue to ease this year, but likely take a pause in the first half of 2025 as it waits to get a better sense of the impact of the new administration's policies on inflation and growth.\"\nHere's what Wall Street said on Opening Bid about a couple of key topics in the wake of Trump's historic win.\nTruist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner on the Fed\n\"The Fed is important, but it's probably not as important as it has been. Markets are still pricing in above 90% chance of a rate cut. I think what happens really is more about the policies that compound and what does that mean for growth? What does it mean for inflation and interest rates? If we look at all this together, it likely means whatever path the Fed was on before, they're probably going to move a little bit slower if we have a little bit stronger growth, a little bit more inflation. But overall, I would prefer an economy that's strong, that supports earnings, to an economy that needs more rate cuts because it's weakening.\"\nListen to more episodes of Opening Bid\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/videos/series/opening-bid/\nIf Elon Musk heads up DOGE, it may unsettle Tesla stock: Analyst\nWill Tesla's Cybercab electrify the stock?\nMarriott chairman: We are a growth company\nWind Shift Capital founder Bill Blain on Tesla\n\"Tesla was one of the shorts that I was proposing last week if Harris had won. Clearly, that's not going to happen. It's all about Musk and what Musk's going to get. And if Musk does get this role at a Department of Government Efficiency, you regulate the whole thing about self-driving, and then that is finally going to be something you can say is really different and valuable about Tesla.\n\"I suspect that this is probably boosterism, and it's not going to be long-term. There are some fantastic things that could well happen for Musk in a new government. And one of the things I sort of jokingly commented about last week, is imagine in Trump's second year that Musk comes in with his undoubted skills and rescues the ailing Boeing. Boeing joins with Musk's SpaceX and creates something new and really exciting.\"\nState Street head of global equity research Marija Veitmane on 'Magnificent 7' stocks\n\"Definitely buy [the \"Magnificent 7,\" which consists of Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla], absolutely 100%. I mean, that's pretty much the one area which has strong earnings growth anywhere in the world. I just don't see earnings power anywhere else in the world.

Since Nov. 30, 2023, the industry\u2019s earnings estimates for 2024 have moved down 94.7%.\n\nDespite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching, as these have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But before we present such stocks, it is worth first looking at the industry\u2019s shareholder returns and current valuation.\nIndustry Beats Sector, S&P 500\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500 Index in the past year.\n\nThe industry has gained 42.4% over this period compared with the S&P 500\u2019s rise of 30.7% and the broader sector\u2019s increase of 14.9%.\nOne-Year Price Performance\nIndustry's Current Valuation\nOn the basis of trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Broadcast Radio and Television stocks, the industry is currently trading at 13.32X versus the S&P 500\u2019s 17.09X and the sector\u2019s 9.9X.\n\nIn the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.76X and as low as 9.3X, recording a median of 4.61X, as the chart below shows.\nEV/EBITDA Ratio (TTM)\n4 Broadcast Radio and Television Stocks to Watch\nNetflix: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been benefiting from its growing subscriber base thanks to a robust content portfolio and revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password-sharing and ad-supported tier. It has also hiked the prices of certain subscription plans. At the end of the third quarter, Netflix had 282.72 million paid subscribers across more than 190 countries globally, up 14.4% year over year. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nNetflix\u2019s diversified content portfolio, backed by heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content, has been driving its growth prospects. Netflix\u2019s sprawling games portfolio is also expected to boost user engagement in the near term.\n\nNetflix now projects revenues to grow 15% year over year in 2024, at the high end of the company\u2019s prior expectation of 14-15% growth. For 2025, based on F/X rates as of Sept. 30, 2024, Netflix expects revenues of $43-$44 billion, indicating growth of 11-13% from 2024 revenue guidance of $38.9 billion. Netflix expects revenue growth to be driven by a healthy increase in paid memberships and ARM. Netflix is seeing significant growth in its advertising business, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year over year in 2025.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has moved north by 3.7% to $19.78 per share in the past 30 days. NFLX\u2019s shares have returned 56.9% year to date.\nPrice and Consensus: NFLX\nRoku: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from increased user engagement on The Roku Channel and the popularity of the Roku TV program. The Roku Channel remained the #3 app on Roku\u2019s platform in the third quarter in terms of reach and engagement, with streaming hours up nearly 80% year over year.\n\nIn the third quarter, the Roku operating system (OS) was again the #1 selling TV OS in the United States, with TV unit sales greater than the next two TV operating systems combined. The Roku OS was also the #1 selling TV OS in Mexico and Canada.\n\nStreaming Households were 85.5 million, representing a net increase of 2 million from the second quarter of 2024. The Roku Home Screen, which is the beginning of viewers\u2019 streaming experience, reaches U.S. households with more than 120 million people every day, reflecting greater engagement and more monetization opportunities. The launch of third-party streaming channels, including Peacock, Disney+ and HBO Max, is aiding user growth. These services have done well on the Roku platform owing to its large base of engaged users and promotional capabilities.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ROKU\u2019s 2024 loss has narrowed by 34 cents to $1.10 per share in the past 30 days. The stock has lost 24% year to date.\nPrice and Consensus: ROKU\nFox: The company is riding on the growing demand for live programming. The robust adoption of Fox News and Fox Business Network is expected to drive the user base in the near term.\u00a0\u00a0 The company is benefiting from the launch of Tubi in the United Kingdom, which has a vast library of more than 20,000 movies and TV episodes on demand.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #3 company generates a significant portion of advertising revenues from live programming, which is relatively immune to the rapidly intensifying competition from subscription-based video-on-demand services. The company has expanded its partnership with The Trade Desk to bring best-in-class innovation to advertisers to help them reach their audiences and measure campaign performance to meet their business objectives. Moreover, recovering ad spending in the local advertising market is a major positive for Fox. Also, increasing affiliate-fee revenues are expected to drive Fox\u2019s top line.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fox\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has moved north by a penny to $3.70 per share in the past 30 days. The stock is up 46.9% year to date.\nPrice and Consensus: FOXA\nTEGNA: It has evolved as one of the largest U.S. broadcasting groups and a leading local news and media content provider, thanks to a plethora of acquisitions. TEGNA\u2019s portfolio of NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX stations operate under long-term affiliation agreements. The television stations sell available commercial advertising spots as well as produce local programming, such as news, sports, and entertainment. TEGNA carries a Zacks Rank #3 currently.\n\nTEGNA\u2019s focus on content creation rather than TV broadcasting lowers the risk of the cord-cutting threat that is affecting the U.S. Pay-TV industry. Live event programming, which remains the most-watched content for viewers, can be sold either to TV channels, websites or streaming services. Additionally, the company has been investing in digital initiatives and streaming services, potentially opening up new revenue streams.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has remained steady at $3.07 per share in the past 30 days. TGNA\u2019s shares have gained 5% year to date.\nPrice and Consensus: TGNA\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThis number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report.\u00a0 The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 5, news publication Financial Times reported that large financial institutions on Wall Street had loaned more than $11 billion to a niche group of tech firms due to the fact that these firms possessed AI chips made by NVIDIA. These chips are crucial for AI firms that want to develop and train their own AI models. Per the report, firms that provide cloud computing to AI firms are the recipient of this funding, provided by groups like Blackstone, Pimco, Carlyle, and BlackRock, among others.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.38%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.59%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.09%.\nHeading into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 10.44% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.11% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.9% in that time.\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Nvidia in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on November 20, 2024. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $0.74 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 85%. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $32.81 billion, indicating an 81.07% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $2.82 per share and a revenue of $124.81 billion, signifying shifts of +116.92% and +104.87%, respectively, from the last year.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Nvidia. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.18% higher. Nvidia presently features a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nWith respect to valuation, Nvidia is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 52.75. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 19.66.\nWe can additionally observe that NVDA currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.48. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 3.3 as of yesterday's close.\nStory Continues\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 15, putting it in the top 6% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the prospect that the US can completely decouple from China in the chip sector, he says \"I'll hesitate to use the word impossible, but it's very difficult. But clearly, even from the first Trump term, that was where they were trying to go.\"\nHe explains, \"The actions that the Biden administration took, I would say, were more surgical. They went after specific things. They went after high-end AI chips. They went after semiconductor equipment for advanced logic and memory, but they weren't really trying to necessarily blow everything up. It was it was manageable. With Trump, he's more like a bull in a china shop.\"\nRasgon says Trump's 60% tariffs \"would have massive implications both in and out of semis.\" He notes that there wouldn't be \"a lot of direct impact for semis on tariffs\" since most of the chips coming into the US from China are in other products like smartphones and PCs. \" It's almost like a secondary kind of thing, if he puts massive tariffs on to make it up on smartphones and PCs, that's going to raise the price of those products in their end markets, and is that going to reduce demand [which,] will certainly roll down to the semiconductors.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), cementing the tech giant's significance in the artificial intelligence era.\nDespite a broader dip in chip stocks Friday, Nvidia notched a weekly gain of roughly 9%. That surge has helped it overtake Apple (AAPL) this week as the world\u2019s most valuable company, with its $3.6 trillion market cap ahead of Apple\u2019s $3.4 trillion as of Friday at market close.\n\u201cA lot of us on Wall Street talk about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC). But really most of America knows the Dow,\u201d said Ritholtz Wealth Management chief market strategist Callie Cox in an interview with Yahoo Finance Friday, \u201cSo a lot of America is going to be introduced or at least have to get a little bit more familiar with Nvidia, and all of what Nvidia means in this AI story.\u201d\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe AI chip market is set to grow 99% in 2024 and another 74% next year, according to consulting firm International Business Strategies, which tracks industry data.\nNvidia has repeatedly disproven fears of a so-called AI bubble and shows no signs of a slowdown. CEO Jensen Huang has touted \u201cinsane\u201d demand for the company's chips.\nSome 90% of analysts recommend buying Nvidia stock and see shares hitting $149.38 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Shares stood at $147.36 Friday.\nCEO Jensen Huang walks on stage before the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nMeanwhile, the former tech darling Intel (INTC), which Nvidia replaced in the Dow, has fallen nearly 50% since the beginning of 2024 as investors grow wary of its ongoing production issues and gloomy financials and question whether its turnaround plan will succeed.\nIn Trump's second term, Nvidia, like the rest of the AI chip market, could face hurdles in the form of high tariffs on Chinese goods and heightened trade tensions. The president-elect has suggested imposing 10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on imports from China \u2014 levels unseen since the Great Depression. Nvidia manufactures its chips in Taiwan with TSMC (TSMC34.SA), which uses components from China to make those chips.\n\"Trump's victory brings further uncertainty to the semiconductor sector in terms of its impact on additional China restrictions, higher tariffs, and CHIPS Act funding,\" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note Friday.\n\u201cDisruptions to the global supply chain would be a problem for NVIDIA because they'd be a problem for TSMC,\u201d D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an interview this week.\nThe chipmaker is set to report quarterly earnings on Nov. 20.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The new arrangement could call for Anthropic to make use of recently launched November 2023 Amazon AI processors, Graviton4 and Trainium2.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nTraditionally, anthropic has depended on Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) processors; Nvidia has an estimated 70% of the market for AI accelerators. According to reports in October 2024, Anthropic was in negotiations to raise further money at a value of about $40 billion. Supported by Microsoft (MSFT, Financials), OpenAI attracted $6.6 billion in investment and valued the business at $157 billion, ranking second most valuable startup worldwide.\nRelatedly, Amazon Web Services has been extending its artificial intelligence capacity from its cloud computing segment.

This action complements Amazon's larger plan to maintain its leadership in the artificial intelligence market and provide its consumers more reasonably priced options.\nNvidia keeps leading the AI chip market meanwhile as its GPUs are extensively used for artificial intelligence training and inference chores. The business has been concentrating on creating increasingly sophisticated processors to satisfy the rising market for artificial intelligence uses. Indicating a greater need for sophisticated, energy-efficient processors vital for AI technology, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, asked SK Hynix to accelerate the production of its HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chips by six months in November 2024.\nSignificantly investing in OpenAI, Microsoft has been implementing OpenAI's ideas into its goods and services. Microsoft and OpenAI were debating in October about how Microsoft's $14 billion investment would turn into stock when OpenAI moves into a for-profit company. This change is likely to affect the dynamics of the AI sector as well as the alliances among its companies.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Its success is largely attributed to its leadership in developing advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media.\n\nMajor cloud service providers rely on NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs to train and run AI applications. The company\u2019s clients include around 20,000 start-ups, along with big names like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang expects the data center business to grow \"quite significantly next year\u201d and said the demand for its AI GPU called Blackwell is \u201cinsane.\u201d It expects billions of dollars in revenues from the new product in the fourth quarter. The chipmaker is attempting to expand production, partnering with Foxconn to build the world's largest Blackwell production facility in Mexico. Analysts at Morgan Stanley project that Blackwell could bring in $10 billion in added revenues before the year-end.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s next-generation GPU chip is expected to drive another round of massive growth. The AI chipmaker unveiled a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip \u2014 called the Blackwell Ultra \u2014 slated to release in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027 (read: NVIDIA Tops $3.5 Trillion: ETFs to Tap the Strength).\n\nMany Wall Street analysts like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America recently raised their target price for NVIDIA, citing strong demand for AI.\nStory Continues\nSolid Estimates\nNVIDIA\u2019s revenues have more than doubled in each of the last five quarters but the streak is expected to end in the third quarter. However, its blistering revenue growth is expected to continue. The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for 81.1% revenue growth for the fiscal third quarter and 62.5% for the fourth.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s earnings are also growing at a steady rate, with projected growth of 85% for the fiscal third quarter and 50% for the fourth. NVIDIA\u2019s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 12.70%, on average, in the last four quarters.\nWhat Does NVDA\u2019s Valuation Say?\nNVIDIA is by far the biggest outperformer among the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d It is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 51.59 versus the Semiconductor - General industry average of 19.56. Despite its high valuation, investor confidence remains strong due to its clear leadership in AI hardware and software solutions. Further, the AI chipmaker\u2019s earnings are growing faster than its share price (read: Pain or Gain Ahead of NVIDIA ETFs?).\n\nFurther, the stock is currently trading at a PEG ratio of 1.45, much lower than the industry average of 3.22. The lower the PEG ratio, the better the value, as investors would pay less for each unit of earnings.\n\nNVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A.\nETFs to Tap\nT-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX) \u2013 NVIDIA exposure: 200%\n\nStrive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC) \u2013 NVIDIA exposure: 26%\n\nAXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF (WUGI) \u2013 NVIDIA exposure: 25.1%\n\nGrizzle Growth ETF (DARP) \u2013 NVIDIA exposure: 21.5%\n\nVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) \u2013 NVIDIA exposure: 22.8%\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe extent to which AI tech may disrupt life as we know it in the coming years is still shrouded in mystery. However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThis number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report.\u00a0 The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. On November 6, Loop Capital raised the price target on the stock to $185 from $170 and kept a Hold rating on the shares. In an investor note, the advisory underlined that it was rolling forward its valuation framework to 2026 targets, also noting that the tech company was doing many things right, especially with spending discipline and increasing stock repurchase through this period of longer-term uncertainty and valuation pressure. The note further added that besides evidence of revenue growth acceleration driven by AI search, which does not seem likely in the near term, the advisory did not see a catalyst for reversal of positive sentiment.\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Macro factors currently driving the economy, such as the relatively high interest rates, relatively strong labor markets, supply chain issues (though minimal right now and in pockets) and so forth have a varied impact on players in the extremely diverse Internet \u2013 Services industry, although a stronger economy is generally positive.\n\nAdditionally, since this is a capital-intensive industry with high fixed cost of operation and the fairly constant need to build infrastructure, a high interest rate just isn\u2019t very positive for it. Therefore, the rate cuts this year make us incrementally positive about the Internet Services industry. Most companies are seeing estimate increases, with prices yet to catch up.\n\nOur picks are Shopify SHOP, Alphabet GOOGL and Uber UBER.\n\nAbout the Industry\nInternet - Services companies are primarily those that rely on huge software and hardware infrastructure (referred to as their \"properties\") to deliver various services to consumers. People can avail the services by accessing these properties with their personal connected devices from almost anywhere in the world.\nCompanies generally operate two models: an ad-based model and an ad-free model where the service is charged. Alphabet, Baidu and Akamai are some of the larger players while Crexendo, Upwork, Dropbox, Etsy, Shopify, Uber, Lyft and Trivago are some of the emerging players. Very large players (mainly Alphabet) tend to skew averages.\nBecause of the diversity of services offered, it is difficult to identify industrywide factors that could affect all players.\nFactors Determining Industry Performance\nIt goes without saying that increased digitization of different aspects of daily life is a driver for the entire industry because digitization essentially transfers work online, which is where Internet service providers are required. To that extent, the pandemic had proved course-altering for the industry because of the huge volume of transactions that moved online. And people are not giving up all of these conveniences to go back to their old ways. The expansion of the installed base of connected devices beyond PCs and smartphones to IoT, automotive and more is creating additional opportunities for targeting. Additionally, the ownership of multiple devices automatically drives people to use these services more as they increasingly automate routine chores.\nBeing a capital-intensive industry, there is the need to raise funds to build out costly infrastructure. Funds are also needed to maintain this infrastructure. Given the secular growth prospects, companies continued infrastructure investments through 2023 and this year, despite high interest rates. With interest rates coming down this year, capex is likely to continue. Ex-Alphabet PP&E is soaring, though not as steadily as Alphabet, meaning that companies are investing heavily in their infrastructure.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet has an outsized impact on industry averages. Therefore, cost rationalization at the company, including a reduction in its workforce and office space, has had a positive effect on industry margins. Acquisitions can also add to operating cost, which doesn\u2019t appear to have been the case this year. Alphabet has been more acquisitive than the industry as seen from the intangibles balance and its margins have continued to soar, supporting industry margins.\nTraffic/customer acquisition is one of the most important drivers of revenue, so companies invest in advertising or building communities that can draw more users to their online properties, to use the service more or spend more time on the platform, much like a store owner would try to keep a prospective buyer within the store. Some large players, including those providing infrastructure services, grow by tying up with other such large players for access to their customers. Since the personal touch is absent in an online store, many rely on cookies and increasingly other technologies to track users, collect data on them and profile them in order to better understand their needs.\nData is central to success in this industry, as it allows the players to build artificial intelligence (AI) models to improve the quality of services, create new technologies and services, and also to lower the cost of operation. Ad-based services are are subject to strict regulations. The EU\u2019s GDPR and the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), for example, require service providers to acquire explicit permission from users before collecting their data. While not all businesses are built on the same scale or have the same customer reach, AI tools are increasingly helping organizations of every size. They are increasing operational efficiency and the scope for growth tremendously. Since larger companies and companies dealing directly with customers have direct access to customer data, there is a corresponding effect on the competitive dynamics as well.\nZacks Industry Rank Is Attractive\nThe Zacks Internet - Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #65, which places it among the top 26% of 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average rank of all the member stocks, indicates that there are several opportunities in the space.\nLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year, we see a bottom in December 2023, followed by one jump in April and another in November 2024. Overall, the industry\u2019s earnings estimate for 2024 is up 19.0% from November 2023. The average earnings estimate for 2025 has increased 10.6% in the same period.\nHistorically, the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. So the industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries should be viewed positively.\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nIndustry Has Outperformed on Stock Market Performance\nOver the past year, the industry has been far more stable than both the broader Technology sector and the S&P 500. Up to the beginning of 2024, the industry was trading more or less in line with the broader sector, as well as the S&P 500. Between this time and April, the broader sector plummeted while the Internet Services industry stayed on its growth trajectory. Thereafter, until about August it continued on the same path while the broader sector joined it, leaving the S&P 500 behind. Since the dip in August, it has recovered, leaving behind the other two.\nAs a result, the industry\u2019s net gain of 40.6% trumps the broader sector\u2019s 33.3% gain and the S&P 500\u2019s 35.5% gain.\nOne-Year Price Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIndustry's Current Valuation: Attractive\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, we see that the industry is currently trading at\u00a0a 21.02X multiple, which is a slight discount to its median value of 21.52X over the past year. It is also a discount to the S&P 500\u2019s 22.43X and a greater discount to the sector\u2019s 26.97X.\nOver the past year, the industry has traded in the range of 20.62X to 23.22X, remaining at a premium to the S&P\u2019s 19.32X to 22.43X throughout. The sector has traded in the 24.58X to 28.16X range.\nForward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n3 Solid Bets\nWe are spoilt for choice because a growing number of players in the Internet Services industry are looking good at this point. This despite the fact that the industry is highly diverse, and so there\u2019s the possibility that some players would be doing exceedingly well while others not so much. We currently have a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) rating on Shopify and Zacks #2 (Buy) rating on Alphabet and Uber Technologies, as discussed below.\nShopify Inc. (SHOP): Ottawa, Canada-based Shopify offers a platform facilitating a whole range of ecommerce operations across Canada, the U.S., the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific and Latin America. The platform enables merchants to display, market and sell products using web and mobile storefronts, physical retail locations, pop-up shops, social media storefronts, native mobile apps, buy buttons and marketplaces. It also enables product sourcing, inventory management, order processing and fulfilment, customer acquisition and relationship building, access to finance, cash, payments and transaction management, and reporting. The company also offers analytics.\nOne of its primary assets is its database of merchant and customer interactions, which helps sellers analyze growth prospects and customer behavior. This is driving tremendous growth at the company, as it continues to take market share. Management said during the June conference call that \u2018More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify\u2019s unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations.\u2019\nThis was borne out by some impressive numbers: year over year growth in in revenue was 21%, with merchant solutions increasing 19%, subscription solutions increasing 27% and monthly recurring revenue 25%. Gross profit dollars grew 25% and free cash flow (FCF) 243%. The outlook was also solid, with another double-digit revenue increase and solid FCF margin expected in the third quarter.\nEstimates are relatively stable ahead of the third quarter earnings announcement next week. At current levels, they represent 22.2% revenue growth and 51.4% earnings growth this year, followed by 19.6% revenue growth and 18.6% earnings growth in the next.\nThe shares have appreciated 36.5% over the past year.\nPrice and Consensus: SHOP\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Mountain View, CA-based Alphabet is known for its flagship search engine, but in the last few years, the company has also branched into a number of other services that its loyal customer base has come to value. These primarily include cloud computing, video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles and healthcare services. On a lower scale, it is also into smartwatches, laptops and tablets, and smart home products. All this is tied together by the treasure trove of data it continues to collect from its various products.\nThe company\u2019s data is one of its greatest assets. At the last quarter\u2019s earnings announcement, management said that the company\u2019s \u2018AI driven innovations across Search, YouTube, Cloud, our Pixel devices and more\u2019 were helping it make \u2018AI more helpful for everyone.\u2019 Alphabet has made significant progress on this front and there\u2019s \u2018lots more to come.\u2019\nDespite its massive size, the company continues to grow its revenue at a double-digit rate. Earnings of $2.12 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.9% on revenue that beat by 2.3%.\nWhat\u2019s more, analysts raised their estimates for the shares yet again: Altogether, the 2024 estimate increased 37 cents (4.8%) in the last 60 days while the 2025 estimate went up 27 cents (3.1%). This amounts to earnings growth projections of 37.9% in 2024 and 11.4% in 2025. This will come from revenue growth projections of a respective 14.8% and 12.1% in the two years.\nThe shares have appreciated 37.4% in the past year.\nPrice and Consensus: GOOGL\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nUber, Inc. (UBER): San Francisco, CA-based Uber Technologies provides ride-hailing, food delivery and freight (leasing vehicles to third parties) services through its Mobility, Delivery and Freight segments, respectively. The company operates across the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Asia.\nEach of its segments generated more than a billion dollars in revenue in the last quarter. Its ride-sharing and delivery platforms are growing in popularity with monthly active platform consumers (MAPC) increasing 13% and MAPC trips increasing 17%. This is generating strong gross bookings, which grew 16% year over year, with Mobility growing 17% at constant currency (CC) and Delivery 16% at CC, as well as strong revenues, which grew 20%, with Mobility up 26% and Delivery 18%. As a result, the company posted a 192.7% earnings surprise and 1.7% sales surprise.\nAnalysts responded in kind, with the 2024 estimate jumping 75 cents (69.4%) since it reported in the past week. The 2025 estimate has raised 22 cents (9.6%) during the same period. Analysts are looking for 17.3% revenue growth and 110.3% earnings growth this year, followed by 16.4% revenue growth and 37.8% earnings growth in the next.\nThe shares have risen 47.8% in the past year.\nPrice and Consensus: UBER\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Alphabet (GOOGL) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this internet search leader is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 24%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 37.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 25.3%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -6.6%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 14.3%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.5% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nAlphabet has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet (GOOGL).\nAlphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.34, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 50 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.34 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 50 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 6% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GOOGL\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GOOGL\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Alphabet, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs GOOGL a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.5% over the past month to $8.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Alphabet.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 11 AI News and Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss.\nThere has been a lot of buzz around AI startups in the past few years, with funding rounds fetching hundreds of millions of dollars and valuations climbing to record highs. For example, OpenAI, of ChatGPT-fame, has become the most valuable private company in the world with a value of over $150 billion in the past few weeks. No other tech startup in the history of the United States has ever been this valuable before a public offering. This valuation is a reflection of the boundless potential of AI. Latest reports, published by news agency Reuters, reveal that the startup is presently involved in talks with authorities in California, where it is based, over a change in business structure that will allow it to become a for-profit business.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nIn 2015, OpenAI was founded as a non-profit AI research lab. The shift towards the for-profit tag is likely to make the company even more attractive to investors. OpenAI has many big tech names among investors, including giants like Microsoft. Reports suggest that since the first billion it invested in the startup back in 2019, the tech giant has invested another $12 billion in the AI firm, bringing total investments in the startup to around $13 billion. The extensive capital spending has led to concerns about threats to fat margins at the company and added pressure on profitability. Market intelligence firm Visible Alpha estimates that the tech giant\u2019s capital spending for a single quarter now is more than its annual expenditure used to be until fiscal 2020.\nREAD ALSO: 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\nAlphabet Inc.

On November 5, reports published by news publication BNN Bloomberg indicated that a smaller AI hub being built by Alphabet in partnership with a wealth fund in Saudi Arabia is likely to serve as the starting point of a much larger AI hub worth almost $100 billion that the Middle Eastern nation is planning to build to rival the AI investments of neighboring United Arab Emirates.

LDOS and Regions Financial Corp. RF.\nBuy 3 High ROE Stocks as Markets Surge on Trump's Election Win\nThe broader equity markets moved northward yesterday on U.S. Presidential election results. With Republican candidate Donald Trump emerging victorious over his Democrat rival Kamala Harris, the markets witnessed a short-term rally, and leading benchmark indices scripted record-high tallies. Experts widely anticipate that Trump's univocal support for lower corporate tax rates, deregulation and industrial policies will spur the U.S. economy and result in another \"Trump rally.\" However, continued geopolitical unrest in the Middle East remains a latent threat, leading to market uncertainty and a volatility slugfest.\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of \"backing and filling\" in the market, they can benefit from \"cash cow\" stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Alphabet Inc., Leidos Holdings, Inc. and Regions Financial Corp. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\nWhy ROE?\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders' Equity\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry \u2014 the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nHere are three of the five stocks that qualified the screening:\nAlphabet: Headquartered in Mountain View, Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, it has evolved from a search engine provider to a firm offering cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming services, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and consumer products.\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.6% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.8%, on average. It has a VGM Score of B. Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nStory Continues\nLeidos: Delaware-based Leidos is a global science and technology leader serving the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. Its core capabilities include providing solutions in the fields of cybersecurity, data analytics, enterprise IT modernization, operations and logistics, sensors, collection and phenomenology, software development and systems engineering.\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 29.9%, on average. It has a VGM Score of A. Leidos sports a Zacks Rank #1.\nRegions Financial: Birmingham, AL-based Regions Financial is a financial holding company that provides retail, commercial and mortgage banking, as well as other financial services in asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, trust services, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory services, and other specialty financing.\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 4.6% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.4%, on average.

That compared with the A$6.81 billion average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.\nThe result points to the challenge for the nation\u2019s biggest banks, which are losing the benefits of the high interest rate cycle. With rates potentially poised to fall next year in Australia, that could weigh on margins and intensify the battle for home loans.\nConsumer banking is facing a \u201cmassive profit challenge,\u201d Elliott told analysts on a call on Friday, for which the only solution is technology simplifications such as its ANZ Plus app that can make the bank a quicker and cheaper competitor.\n\u201cCompetition and rate cycle uncertainties represent a challenge for the banking sector,\u201d he said.\nANZ is also contending with an investigation by the nation\u2019s securities regulator into the trading of government bonds, while traders earlier this year departed the bank amid allegations of misconduct.\n\u201cWe are expediting the work we have underway to improve our non-financial risk practices,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThis, along with continuing to drive a strong speak-up culture, is a key focus of mine as CEO \u2014 as well as across the bank more broadly.\u201d\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in August imposed an increased risk buffer on ANZ\u2019s capital due to the bank\u2019s weaknesses in non-financial risk management. Elliott said Friday he didn\u2019t expect that to be reduced again over the next financial year.\nIn its Australian retail business, the firm said home loans grew 7%, as did customer deposits. Its institutional unit saw strong growth in operational deposits and markets revenue came in at A$2.2 billion, up 4% on last year.\nHardship Support\n\u201cHigher interest rates are impacting customers and we saw an increase in those requiring hardship support,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cOur data shows customers, in general, are holding up better than expected.\u201d\nAnalysts highlighted the risk to margins and the dividend next year. Profit for the bank might fall another 15%, which would limit payouts to shareholders, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior industry analyst Matt Ingram.\nStory Continues\n\u201cANZ\u2019s targeted 60-65% payout leaves little room for uplift in the face of profit pressure,\u201d Ingram said.\nANZ shares were 0.9% higher as of 1:22 p.m. in Sydney.

No information has been provided on what personal information would be required to demonstrate proof of age on social media, or the penalties firms might face for breaching the laws. The government has also not offered an exhaustive list of which platforms are considered social media.\nCommunications Minister Michelle Rowland said that under the new legislation, such services would be labeled as \u201cage-restricted.\u201d The minister said the government would review individual websites and online services to decide whether they fall under the laws, but added that gaming services and messaging apps would likely be exempt.\nAustralia has a history of taking on large technology companies that run social sites, including a push in 2021 to make Meta\u2019s Facebook and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google pay for news content. More recently, the government clashed with Elon Musk\u2019s X Corp. over a failure to remove a video of a terrorist attack in Sydney.\nMeta Regional Policy Director for Australia Mia Garlick said that while the company agrees that young people need to have \u201cage-appropriate experiences\u201d on social media, it\u2019s important to consider how that can be enacted practically.\n\u201cThe challenge is that the technology isn\u2019t quite there yet in terms of having a perfect solution,\u201d Garlick told Australian Broadcasting Corp.

The initiative, announced Thursday, aims to shave nearly 1 gigawatt of electricity demand \u2014 enough to power 200,000 Texas homes or about 1% of the record summer demand seen this year on the state grid.\n\u201cThe entire industry has been built to serve the peak load on the hottest day of the year,\u201d said Rasesh Patel, president of NRG\u2019s consumer unit. \u201cThis allows us to be a lot more smarter about demand in shaving the peak.\u201d\nEnrollment in the program, where consumers see cost savings or other incentives for curtailing energy usage, opens in the spring. NRG residential customers will receive service installation of a Vivint doorbell camera and either a Vivint or Google Nest thermostat for free.\nNRG expects to sign up enough homes to free up 300 megawatts of electricity demand within the first two years, according to Patel. That is expected to climb to 650 megawatts by 2030, before reaching its 1 gigawatt goal by 2035. Patel said pooling together homes costs $100 per kilowatt \u2014 about a tenth the cost of building a typical natural gas-fueled power plant. That would put the program cost at about $100 million.\nGoogle Cloud will be tapped for its AI and machine learning to determine the best time to cool or heat homes, based on a household\u2019s energy usage patterns and ambient temperatures. Renew Home Chief Executive Officer Ben Brown said in the interview that the platform will expand beyond the thermostat and large appliances to managing battery storage and electric vehicles.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's November Portfolio.\nStock markets are roaring amid Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Jim Cramer, who has long believed that Trump\u2019s presidency would bode well for the stock market, earlier this week discussed the market\u2019s reaction when chances of a Kamala Harris win were apparently rising. Looking back at Cramer\u2019s analysis in hindsight gives us a nice overview of what groups of stocks could rise in the coming weeks and months.\nJim Cramer on Monday evening analyzed what caused the market to dip as of the closing session. Cramer believed the chances of Iowa turning blue spooked some market circles on various assumptions:\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the most incredible reactions, the bond market. Interest rates went sharply lower today. Now, see, I\u2019m so used to higher, to interest rates going higher in a Democratic win, that this took me by surprise. It\u2019s completely out of character. But the bond market is steep, and its judgment is not made on a whim. There had to be billions of dollars invested today on rates going lower if Harris wins the election. I find that astonishing.\u201d\nCramer then talked about different groups of stocks that moved based on the sentiment that Harris could win this election. Housing stocks rose because the market is bullish based on potential subsidies if Harris wins. Tech stocks, however, fell, and Cramer explained the reason behind that:\n\u201c(hyper scalers and tech stocks) traded horribly today. What does it say? It says the traders are betting that Harris will stand by Biden\u2019s FTC and antitrust appointments who are known to be anti-the hyper scalers,\u201d Cramer added.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nJim Cramer Says Alphabet (GOOGL) Stock Can \u2018Keep Running for Days and Days\u2019\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 216\nTalking about Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s latest quarterly results, Jim Cramer said on CNBC that no one was expecting strong results from the company, even him despite owning the stock for his charitable trust.\n\u201cWe had a quarter that was like the old Google when it was still called Google. Search was fabulous. YouTube was great. Google Cloud is on fire. It shot up almost 3% in response, and I bet it can keep running for days and days. It was that much better than expected.\u201d\nCramer said Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0shares are inexpensive.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported strong quarterly results recently. The results show that the market has been ignoring the company\u2019s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught.\nAlphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. Currently, Google\u2019s stock trades below 20 times forward earnings, offering potential upside as EPS and other financial metrics strengthen in coming years. For next year, the consensus EPS estimate sits around $9. However, Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0has consistently beaten projections, delivering $7.54 in trailing twelve-month EPS compared to the expected $6.79\u2014a roughly 11% outperformance.\nWhat are the key drivers for Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)?\nAlphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August.\nThis growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day\u2014substantially higher than Uber\u2019s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber\u2019s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo\u2019s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing.\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s Search & Other segment saw a 12.2% year-over-year revenue increase, rising from $44.03 billion to $49.39 billion. YouTube advertising also performed well, with revenue up 12.2% to $8.92 billion from $7.95 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue grew even more sharply, surging 27.8% from $8.34 billion to $10.66 billion.\nGoogle Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit\u2014a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment\u2019s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year.\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund (Hedged) stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) operating performance remains strong with sales growing 14% in the most recent quarter. Highlights included the ongoing secular growth of digital advertising driving Google search (+14%), YouTube\u2019s continued success as a leading content platform (+13%) and the performance of the Cloud business (+29%). In conjunction with this strong sales momentum, Alphabet\u2019s increased focus on expenses is delivering margin expansion such that Operating Income grew 26%.\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's November Portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThis number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report.\u00a0 The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

On November 7, Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of the AI unit at the tech giant, said that 2025 might be the year that AI achieves persistent memory, a breakthrough that, per the executive, would fundamentally change how the world interacts with AI systems. He made the comments during a tour to India, as reported by news publication Times of India. Suleyman also said that his company had been working on prototypes that had near infinite memory, a trait that would help the new maintain a constant and evolving dialogue with users.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

The new arrangement could call for Anthropic to make use of recently launched November 2023 Amazon AI processors, Graviton4 and Trainium2.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nTraditionally, anthropic has depended on Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) processors; Nvidia has an estimated 70% of the market for AI accelerators. According to reports in October 2024, Anthropic was in negotiations to raise further money at a value of about $40 billion. Supported by Microsoft (MSFT, Financials), OpenAI attracted $6.6 billion in investment and valued the business at $157 billion, ranking second most valuable startup worldwide.\nRelatedly, Amazon Web Services has been extending its artificial intelligence capacity from its cloud computing segment.

This action complements Amazon's larger plan to maintain its leadership in the artificial intelligence market and provide its consumers more reasonably priced options.\nNvidia keeps leading the AI chip market meanwhile as its GPUs are extensively used for artificial intelligence training and inference chores. The business has been concentrating on creating increasingly sophisticated processors to satisfy the rising market for artificial intelligence uses. Indicating a greater need for sophisticated, energy-efficient processors vital for AI technology, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, asked SK Hynix to accelerate the production of its HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chips by six months in November 2024.\nSignificantly investing in OpenAI, Microsoft has been implementing OpenAI's ideas into its goods and services. Microsoft and OpenAI were debating in October about how Microsoft's $14 billion investment would turn into stock when OpenAI moves into a for-profit company. This change is likely to affect the dynamics of the AI sector as well as the alliances among its companies.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss.\nThere has been a lot of buzz around AI startups in the past few years, with funding rounds fetching hundreds of millions of dollars and valuations climbing to record highs. For example, OpenAI, of ChatGPT-fame, has become the most valuable private company in the world with a value of over $150 billion in the past few weeks. No other tech startup in the history of the United States has ever been this valuable before a public offering. This valuation is a reflection of the boundless potential of AI. Latest reports, published by news agency Reuters, reveal that the startup is presently involved in talks with authorities in California, where it is based, over a change in business structure that will allow it to become a for-profit business.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nIn 2015, OpenAI was founded as a non-profit AI research lab. The shift towards the for-profit tag is likely to make the company even more attractive to investors. OpenAI has many big tech names among investors, including giants like Microsoft. Reports suggest that since the first billion it invested in the startup back in 2019, the tech giant has invested another $12 billion in the AI firm, bringing total investments in the startup to around $13 billion. The extensive capital spending has led to concerns about threats to fat margins at the company and added pressure on profitability. Market intelligence firm Visible Alpha estimates that the tech giant\u2019s capital spending for a single quarter now is more than its annual expenditure used to be until fiscal 2020.\nREAD ALSO: 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's November Portfolio.\nStock markets are roaring amid Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Jim Cramer, who has long believed that Trump\u2019s presidency would bode well for the stock market, earlier this week discussed the market\u2019s reaction when chances of a Kamala Harris win were apparently rising. Looking back at Cramer\u2019s analysis in hindsight gives us a nice overview of what groups of stocks could rise in the coming weeks and months.\nJim Cramer on Monday evening analyzed what caused the market to dip as of the closing session. Cramer believed the chances of Iowa turning blue spooked some market circles on various assumptions:\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the most incredible reactions, the bond market. Interest rates went sharply lower today. Now, see, I\u2019m so used to higher, to interest rates going higher in a Democratic win, that this took me by surprise. It\u2019s completely out of character. But the bond market is steep, and its judgment is not made on a whim. There had to be billions of dollars invested today on rates going lower if Harris wins the election. I find that astonishing.\u201d\nCramer then talked about different groups of stocks that moved based on the sentiment that Harris could win this election. Housing stocks rose because the market is bullish based on potential subsidies if Harris wins. Tech stocks, however, fell, and Cramer explained the reason behind that:\n\u201c(hyper scalers and tech stocks) traded horribly today. What does it say? It says the traders are betting that Harris will stand by Biden\u2019s FTC and antitrust appointments who are known to be anti-the hyper scalers,\u201d Cramer added.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nJim Cramer Says Microsoft (MSFT) Will Have \u2018Total Dominance\u2019 in AI Enterprise Market\nPhoto by Microsoft 365 on Unsplash\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nTalking about Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0earnings results, Jim Cramer said in a latest program that the company\u2019s guidance seems to be conservative and the stock fell mostly because traders bought it after headline numbers but sold after the company talked about detailed numbers during the earnings call:\nStory Continues\n\u201cFor as long as I\u2019ve known Amy Hood, and that\u2019s probably about three decades, she\u2019s been conservative in giving outlooks. That\u2019s her nature. It\u2019s a big reason why she\u2019s so great at her job. She never overpromises. She\u2019s more than likely to deliver on her projections. If you look at her body of work, that\u2019s what she has done over and over again. Incredible track record.\u201d\nCramer also praised Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s growing market share in the enterprise space:\n\u201cThey will have total dominance of AI in the enterprise market, a remarkable feat, and they did it in about a year\u2019s time. You may want to say that\u2019s not worth anything and lock in some gains. I say fine.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0shares recently fell after the company reported its latest quarterly results. Analysts believe most of the revenue beat came from PC segment, while investors were paying more attention to AI and Azure. Azure\u2019s 34% growth met expectations, though guidance for next quarter fell short, projecting between 31% and 32% growth\u20141 percentage point below forecasts. This dip is attributed to delays in data center capacity from third-party providers, though Azure\u2019s consumption trends remained steady.\nInvestors hoping for a rebound in IT spending were likely disappointed, as stable Azure consumption suggests no significant uptick in the second half of the year. In addition, the lower-than-expected Q2 guidance underscored tempered growth expectations.\nAI services, however, contributed a robust 12 points to Azure\u2019s growth, a steady continuation from the previous quarter. Microsoft\u2019s management confirmed strong demand for AI services, although supply constraints are limiting further expansion. Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0anticipates AI-related revenues, including M365 Copilot and Azure AI, could reach $10 billion annually by next quarter\u2014making it one of the fastest-growing segments in Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s history.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $147 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. Shares gave back some gains from strong performance over the first half of this year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported a strong quarter with total revenue growing 16%, in line with the Street; Microsoft Cloud up 22%; Azure up 30%; 43% operating income margins; and 36% free cash flow margins. Core Azure growth came in one point shy of expectations, however, due to a soft European market and continued constraints on AI compute capacity. In the same vein, while Microsoft reiterated its fiscal 2025 targets of double-digit top-line and operating income growth, quarterly guidance called for Azure growth to slow a bit before accelerating in the back half of the fiscal year, as capital expenditures increase, yielding an expansion of AI compute capacity. We believe this investment is a leading indicator for growth, with more than half of the spend related to durable land and data center build outs, which should monetize over the next 15-plus years. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes, and we remain investors.\u201d\nOverall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's November Portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Bosa notes that artificial intelligence could be \u201cless regulated\u201d and \u201cmore volatile\u201d under Trump's leadership. However, the president-elect\u2019s AI policy could be a boon to the industry itself, albeit at the expense of necessary guardrails for AI.

On the other hand, Trump\u2019s allies have been proposing a different executive order that would launch a series of \u201cManhattan Projects\u201d for developing military technology and immediately review \u201cunnecessary and burdensome regulations\u201d to \u201cMake America Great in AI\u201d.\nTrump, however, seems to be only one of the few who thinks imposing guardrails on artificial intelligence could prove detrimental to the US. A poll shared with Time reveals that Americans across the political spectrum are skeptical about the idea that the U.S. should avoid regulating AI to outcompete China. According to a poll by the AI Policy Institute (AIPI), 75% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans believe that \u201ctaking a careful controlled approach\u201d to AI is preferable as opposed to \u201cmoving forward on AI as fast as possible to be the first country to get extremely powerful AI.\u201d\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAmid the ongoing debate, recent developments in AI are rapidly shaping the landscape in the backdrop. For instance, Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine, is said to be raising new investment that would value the search startup to a staggering $9 billion. The new funding round is set to raise $500 million led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which also holds a board seat in the startup.\nIn other news, OpenAI, an AI research lab and company, has acquired Chat.com, further adding to its collection of high-profile domain names. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the acquisition via email. While such AI-related news is often striking, AI capabilities continue to surprise even the most seasoned experts. In fact, AI can now even help you become a better parent. On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz's partner Justine Moore took to X to share an investment idea, advocating for \"a new wave of 'parenting co-pilots' powered by LLMs and agents. She highlighted companies such as Cradlewise, creators of an AI-driven baby monitor that tracks sleep patterns and rocks the crib, and Nanit, which utilizes AI to analyze crib footage and monitor a baby's breathing.\nStory Continues\n\u201cImagine an AI parenting companion that\u2019s always in your corner \u2013 ready to answer questions or talk about how you\u2019re feeling at any time of the day (or night)\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

With this acquisition, CrowdStrike will be the only cybersecurity vendor to provide unified, end-to-end protection against identity-based attacks across the entire modern cloud ecosystem \u2013 from on-premises Active Directory to cloud-based identity providers and SaaS applications \u2013 delivered from a single, unified platform. Announced at Fal.Con Europe, CrowdStrike\u2019s inaugural premier user conference in the region, this acquisition will position CrowdStrike as the leading provider of comprehensive protection across complex hybrid environments.\n\"CrowdStrike was built to tackle the toughest cybersecurity challenges, and we drive relentless innovation based on what our customers need to stay ahead of modern threats,\" said George Kurtz, CEO and founder, CrowdStrike. \"As SaaS and AI adoption grows, every new application brings additional complexity and the risk of misconfigurations across human and non-human accounts that create openings for sophisticated attacks. With the acquisition of Adaptive Shield, CrowdStrike will continue to set the standard for identity-based protection in the cloud, delivering best-in-class SaaS protection from the Falcon platform.\"\nIdentity-Based Attacks in the Cloud Target SaaS Applications\nCloud exploitation cases grew by 110% last year, while identity-based attacks continue to rise \u2013 75% of attacks to gain initial access are now malware-free. \u2018Cross-domain\u2019 adversaries, targeting identity and cloud, have numerous attack paths, from on-premises Active Directory to cloud-based identity providers and the growing landscape of SaaS applications. The complexity of modern hybrid cloud environments and disconnected security tools create protection gaps, making it difficult to prevent identity-based threats. SaaS is projected to be the largest category of cloud computing in 2024, capturing more than 40% of all public cloud spending1. Under the SaaS shared responsibility model, SaaS vendors provide security controls, while organizations manage configurations. In today\u2019s complex environments, where hundreds of SaaS applications each come with unique access controls and identity configurations, security teams face significant challenges in maintaining visibility into who has access, what sensitive data is exposed, and active threats \u2013 even with purpose-built SaaS protection.\nStory Continues\nAdaptive Shield and the Falcon Platform \u2013 Comprehensive Identity and SaaS Security\nAdaptive Shield delivers the industry\u2019s most complete security posture management and threat protection across SaaS identities, misconfigurations and data, stopping SaaS breaches. As an integrated component of the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae cybersecurity platform, Adaptive Shield will equip CrowdStrike with the most advanced capabilities to stop identity-based attacks across all aspects of modern hybrid cloud environments. Customer benefits will include:\nComprehensive SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM): Organizations gain full visibility and governance over misconfigurations, the entitlements and activity levels of both human and non-human identities, and exposed data across 150+ SaaS applications. This new end-to-end visibility of identities across hybrid cloud environments gives operators unique context for rapid cloud detection and response (CDR).\nGenAI Application Security Control: By continuously monitoring GenAI SaaS applications, Adaptive Shield empowers organizations to enforce consistent security standards by detecting configuration shifts, controlling AI settings to prevent data leakage, and identifying shadow AI applications to revoke access based on their risk profile. This approach ensures that AI-integrated applications remain aligned with security policies to protect sensitive data.\nUnified Hybrid Identity and Cloud Security: The powerful combination of Adaptive Shield and CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Identity Protection will provide customers with comprehensive identity protection across SaaS, on-premises Active Directory and cloud-based environments (Okta and Microsoft Entra ID). CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Cloud Security customers will also gain unified visibility and protection across the entire modern cloud estate \u2013 infrastructure, custom applications, data, AI models and SaaS applications \u2013 all from the same unified console and workflow.\nExisting Integration Accelerates Detection and Response: Adaptive Shield\u2019s existing integration with CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen SIEM provides rapid first-party detection and response across multiple security domains \u2013 endpoints, identities, workloads and applications \u2013 automatically correlating detections inline with the latest threat intelligence and Falcon Fusion SOAR delivering near real-time response.\n\"Widespread adoption of SaaS applications has rapidly expanded the enterprise attack surface, as shared responsibility models and fragmented security controls make SaaS environments a prime target,\" said Maor Bin, CEO and co-founder, Adaptive Shield. \"Our mission perfectly complements CrowdStrike, stopping SaaS breaches while further accelerating consolidation on cybersecurity's most comprehensive platform. I'm incredibly proud of our team for building the most advanced SaaS security solution, defining the market.\"\nTo learn more about Adaptive Shield and CrowdStrike, please visit here.\nTransaction Details\nThe purchase price is contemplated to be paid predominantly in cash and includes a portion to be delivered in the form of stock subject to vesting conditions.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Cloud Security earns perfect scores in API Security, Automation, Threat Hunting, Scalability, Cost, and Compliance\nAUSTIN, Texas, November 04, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) today announced it has been named a Leader in the 2024 GigaOm Radar Report for Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs). The report recognizes CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Cloud Security\u2019s innovation and performance, earning perfect 5/5 scores in critical functionality areas including API Security, Security Automation and Orchestration, Threat Hunting and Anomaly Detection, Scalability, Cost, and Compliance.\nAccording to the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report, cloud exploitation cases surged by 110% over the past year, with adversaries becoming increasingly focused and persistent. Stopping cloud breaches requires a modern CNAPP that delivers comprehensive visibility and protection across every attack path. CrowdStrike is the only platform that protects the entire modern cloud estate\u2014infrastructure, applications, data and AI models\u2014from a single, unified platform, so organizations can easily consolidate point products, reduce complexity and stop cloud breaches.\nCrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Security is differentiated from point cloud security tools in the market in the following areas:\nConsolidated Code to Cloud Protection: With unified visibility and protection in a single-agent and agentless platform architecture, CrowdStrike eliminates security gaps and stops cloud breaches without making customers manage different cloud security point products. Customers can consolidate the disjointed point products across their entire cloud estate to reduce overall costs and eliminate complexity.\nBuilt to Stop Breaches: Many CNAPPs are thinly veiled CSPMs, built as cloud vulnerability management tools lacking capabilities to stop cloud breaches. CrowdStrike stops threats in real-time with advanced runtime protection delivered from the same unified agent as CrowdStrike\u2019s best-in-class EDR and Identity Protection. Leveraging world-class managed threat hunting and intelligence, CrowdStrike sets the standard for cloud detection and response (CDR) as a native part of the most comprehensive cloud security platform, built to stop the breach.\nComplete Hybrid Cloud Security: With most organizations operating a hybrid architecture, CrowdStrike provides unified protection across cloud and on-prem environments through a single sensor. This ensures full visibility and security coverage, including cloud-native technologies like ASPM, which work seamlessly across both cloud and on-prem applications. CrowdStrike stops attackers as they move between environments, eliminating gaps and simplifying hybrid cloud security.\nStory Continues\n\"Cloud security is at a critical inflection point\u2014adversaries are more relentless than ever, leveraging stolen identity credentials to exploit cloud environments as a preferred attack vector. Traditional approaches and point cloud security tools are not sufficient to provide the visibility and protection needed to stop cloud breaches,\" said Raj Rajamani, head of products, CrowdStrike. \"At CrowdStrike, we are redefining what\u2019s possible in cloud security. Being recognized as a Leader by GigaOm underscores our relentless innovation and leadership in the market. Falcon Cloud Security goes beyond visibility\u2014it provides automated intelligence, threat hunting, protection and scalability, empowering organizations to not only detect cloud issues but also stop breaches in real time, outpace adversaries, and confidently secure their cloud environments for the future.\"\nAccording to Chris Ray, Principal Analyst at GigaOm: \"Falcon Cloud Security received a 5/5 in several areas, most notably in API security. This high score is attributed to its ability to positively identify APIs used by applications in client clouds, as well as analyze upstream and downstream communication among applications and services to understand risks.\" He added: \"The solution also stands out in scalability, leveraging a cloud-native architecture claimed to handle trillions of events per day while also supporting smaller deployments of less than 100 assets\u2026The solution\u2019s comprehensive approach makes [Falcon Cloud Security] valuable for securing cloud-native applications, managing cloud misconfigurations, and protecting against advanced threats in cloud environments.\"\nFor more information on the GigaOm Radar Report for Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs), please visit our website.\nAbout CrowdStrike\nCrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, has redefined modern security with the world\u2019s most advanced cloud-native platform for protecting critical areas of enterprise risk \u2013 endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data.\nPowered by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud and world-class AI, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform leverages real-time indicators of attack, threat intelligence, evolving adversary tradecraft and enriched telemetry from across the enterprise to deliver hyper-accurate detections, automated protection and remediation, elite threat hunting and prioritized observability of vulnerabilities.\nPurpose-built in the cloud with a single lightweight-agent architecture, the Falcon platform delivers rapid and scalable deployment, superior protection and performance, reduced complexity and immediate time-to-value.\nCrowdStrike: We stop breaches.\nLearn more: https://www.crowdstrike.com/\nFollow us: Blog | Twitter | LinkedIn | Facebook | Instagram\nStart a free trial today: https://www.crowdstrike.com/free-trial-guide/\n\u00a9 2024 CrowdStrike, Inc.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in CrowdStrike Holdings implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\nInsiders have been selling lately\nEvery investor in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CrowdStrike Holdings.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CrowdStrike Holdings?\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nWe can see that CrowdStrike Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of CrowdStrike Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in CrowdStrike Holdings. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.6%. With 7.5% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO George Kurtz is the owner of 3.1% of the company's shares.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nStory Continues\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.. Insiders own US$3.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over CrowdStrike Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with CrowdStrike Holdings .\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

          "whole_article": "Incidents like the mass computer outage caused by Microsoft's third-party provider, CrowdStrike, have prompted a rethink about the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing in the financial world, central bankers and executives said at a conference in Hong Kong.\nSuch grand-scale outages have served as a wake-up call to the financial services industry, which needs to pay greater attention to operational resilience and risk management, these people said at the joint conference by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Bank for International Settlements on Thursday.\nEddie Yue Wai-man, the HKMA's CEO, said a major risk that has been identified is the use of third-party service providers. He said that firms depend heavily on big technology companies for computing power and the ability to deal with large data sets related to AI. If these major operators experience glitches, catastrophic results could radiate outward.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"If any of these few service providers suffer from IT failures or cyberattacks, the outcome could be very difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It's like CrowdStrike 10 times bigger.\"\nIn July, a botched software update by US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affected 8.5 million Windows-based devices worldwide, creating a major disruption for the airports, banks and healthcare providers that relied on its cloud computing services.\n\"CrowdStrike is a wake-up call to say, all these security software and network monitoring tools that have a high level of privilege and access across our estate and to some extent, automatic software updates - how comfortable are we with that,\" said Balbir Bakhshi, chief risk officer at the London Stock Exchange Group.\n\"There is an opportunity to do something different in this space through a more collaborative approach.\"\nGreater regulation of third parties and increasing public-private partnerships would be helpful, he said. He added that a lot of time and effort would be freed up when there is a set of regulator-approved control standards for the industry.\nYue said banks are required to conduct risk assessments of AI service providers to strengthen their operational resilience and must have in place contingency plans to address potential service disruptions caused by third parties.\nStory Continues\nThese \"basic, common sense\" moves are essential to better safeguard companies and other institutions, said James Elwes, HSBC's chief information officer for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"[Third-party risk management] starts with simply identifying where your concentration risk is and documenting that,\" he said. \"If you've not done that, you're not going to do any of the next steps that are important.\"\nVendor diversification could help to solve some issues, Elwes said, but he added that big tech companies are often the most well-equipped to be third-party service providers.\n\"There are benefits to concentration simply because of the nature of some of these organisations - the scale they can provide and the investment they can put in,\" he said.\n\"So a degree of concentration on vendors, especially within technology, is likely to remain.\"\nSarah Breeden, deputy governor at the Bank of England, said in a pre-recorded speech that financial institutions are expected to have a \"stronger and more rigorous\" grasp of AI as they increase their dependence on it for \"higher impact areas of their businesses.\" These areas include credit risk assessment, capital management and algorithmic trading.\nHong Kong's government unveiled its first guidelines on the responsible use of AI on Monday. They said any financial institution that wants to use AI must have a strategy on how the systems should be implemented and used, as well as offer advisory and training services for on-premise deployment.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

This change in analyst sentiment followed CEO Hock Tan's discourse at the Digital X special event in Cologne, Germany, where he outlined Broadcom's strategy of tapping into AI inference solutions.\nAI technology is expected to create massive advances in the sector in the area of AI inference, the capability of AI systems to make a prediction or draw some conclusion without specific outcomes previously determined to be achievable. For instance, this inference lets self-driving cars detect stop signs, which infers the real-world use of AI inference in self-driving automobiles, even though the automobiles have not been through specific routes before.\nAs a result, financial analysts have set higher stock price targets for Broadcom to demonstrate higher investor confidence in the company, particularly due to its new AI business venture. Furthermore, Broadcom is developing a new AI chip in partnership with OpenAI to enhance the deployment efficiency of AI models after training, which has put Broadcom in the radical vanguard of AI.\nHowever, there are concerns with this growth, such as data sovereignty and another concern about the readiness of the world for semiconductors, where Taiwan alone accounts for 60% of the world's semiconductors and 90% of the advanced ones. These issues express the geopolitical and logistical risks associated with the semiconductor supply chain, something inherently important for Broadcom's growing AI endeavors.\nNevertheless, considered challenges contribute to the growth of Broadcom's proactive approach to the realization of AI technologies and cooperation with key industry actors like OpenAI and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial), which proves the firm's focus on sustaining competitive advantage in the unstable and non-linear industry.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss.\nJohn Lovelock, Chief of Research for Global IT Forecasting at Gartner, joined CNBC\u2019s Worldwide Exchange to discuss the major catalyst for IT spending in 2025: Generative AI. He states that companies are now moving from cost-saving optimizations and any upgrading they have been focused on for the past eighteen months, with growth back on their agenda. For 2025, \u201cthey are shifting back to growth\u201d, he says, emphasizing the need for GenAI to boost revenue expansion.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November\nLovelock further elaborates that most of the growth in GenAI spending this year and next year is in the tech sector. All the big-tech companies are building the AI infrastructure needed for GenAI, whereas software companies are spending to incorporate GenAI in their products and services. The biggest area of growth next year, however, is data centers, projected to grow over 15%. When asked if this is a slowdown from the previous year\u2019s 35% growth, he remarked that the denominator is getting \u201cawfully big\u201d.\nEnterprises, banks, governments, retailers, and everyone else are building up or buying AI-optimized servers. However, the biggest purchasers are still the hyperscalers. The massive amount of money they are going to be spending will surpass all of the money Big Tech companies have previously spent on CPU servers from 2000 to 2026. While the net increase continues, the sheer spending of the hyperscalers is keeping the growth rate down, Lovelock notes.\nNew estimates from Morgan Stanley reinstate the same, with four of the Big Tech companies expected to invest about $300 billion in capital expenditures next year, and 2026 is expected to be even bigger. The bank notes that much of the CapEx is focused on hyperscalers. These hyperscalers, with their extensive cloud networks, are in a significant multi-year investment cycle driven by the pursuit of opportunities in generative AI and large language models.\n\"These high and rising CapEx numbers again speak to the importance of continued disclosure about new/incremental adoption, engagement, and revenue opportunities each of the four companies are seeing and investing in\u201d.\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nIn recent AI news, we've seen prominent announcements from companies unveiling breakthroughs in large language models, AI hardware, and partnerships that aim to incorporate AI more deeply into core business functions. On November 5, CNBC reported that Perplexity AI, the artificial intelligence startup, is in the final stages of raising $500 million in funding at a $9 billion valuation. The company has been gaining significant investor attention due to the generative AI boom.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, You.com and TollBit\u2019s have created a partnership for the first-of-its-kind AI agent. \u201cElection Agent\u201d will be able to access accurate, authoritative results and race calls from Decision Desk HQ \u2014 the election data provider that was the first to call the presidential elections of 2016 and 2020.

That said, investors and analysts are excited to see what this earnings period has to offer for the magnificent seven and how much of an influence they have on the market. On October 31, Christian Dery, head of macro strategy at Capital Fund Management, appeared in an interview\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the impact of the magnificent seven on the market.\nDery suggested that these companies have grown to become large entities and their market capitalization often fluctuates by $2 billion to $400 billion on earnings events. Looking at the dispersion of the index, Dery adds that individual stocks within the S&P are very diverse and more independent, hinting towards a very low correlation in the index.\nHe adds that generative AI and LLMs are very different from the traditional software business. Therefore, the hyperscaling model that is conventionally taken from software can not be applied here. For every new customer in the software business, the marginal cost often goes down to nearly zero. However, if you look at the \u201ctech incumbents\u201d, they have to increase their capital expenditures to develop compute clusters and scale their operations, suggests Dery.\nIn 2023, the chips industry generated revenue of about $3 billion, reflecting that we are yet to find a killer use case or see results of generous AI spending. Dery adds that the market is more likely to be \u201cdiscerning\u201d on the path to profitability since companies are going to focus more on capital expenditures and projections for capital expenditures. He is particularly interested in the CapEx projections of the Magnificent Seven and shares that if they miss there could be a negative reaction among those stocks.\nDery reiterated that the market is yet to see the investments pay off multiple times but maintains his interest in capital expenditures by these companies playing out. While he is bullish on technological innovation and believes artificial intelligence is disruptive and a \u201cbig deal\u201d, he fails to see viable results as of now. Dery also emphasizes that these companies are directing their investments to AI because they do not want to fall behind competitors, with no proper timeline for AI monetization.\nStory Continues\nThat said, some companies are investing heavily in innovation and are at the forefront of a technological revolution.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we went over multiple similar rankings on the internet from credible financial websites. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones.

(AVGO)'s AI Innovations and Strategic Partnerships Drive Revenue Surge\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making is application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\n2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies, such as the industry\u2019s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, which facilitate the management of large datasets for AI tasks. On October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom\u2019s subsidiary, T-Systems, to keep its strategy active. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider.\nDuring the third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) generated $13.1 billion in revenue, up by 47% year over year. The growth in revenue and operating profits was driven by AI revenue, VMware bookings, and sustained non-AI semiconductor revenue. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially to $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion, driven by ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers.\nBroadcom Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as it leverages artificial intelligence. In addition to that, company officials believe AVGO is finally achieving stability on a company-wide level and is on track to becoming an AI powerhouse.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 6th on our list of best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nTenet Healthcare, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a healthcare services company that owns and operates general hospitals and related healthcare facilities for urban and rural communities in numerous states.\nThe company's earnings outlook has shifted positively across the board, a bullish sign for near-term share movement.\nIn addition to favorable earnings estimate revisions, the stock resides in the Zacks Medical \u2013 Hospital industry, currently ranked in the top 10% of all Zacks industries. Let's take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.\nTenet Healthcare Raises Guidance\nTenet Healthcare shares have been scorching-hot in 2024, up 115% and even outperforming many of the Mag 7 members. Favorable quarterly results have helped keep shares moving higher all year long, moving higher again following the latest print that revealed an adjusted EBITDA guidance upgrade.\nThe company's cash-generating abilities also saw a positive boost throughout the latest period, with free cash flow of $1.8 billion nearly 80% higher than the year-ago figure. And to the likes of shareholders, the company continued to aggressively buy back its shares throughout the period, scooping up $124 million worth.\nTHC has regularly bought its shares back over recent years, helping establish a small floor.\nThe valuation picture here isn't expensive, with the current 14.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple a few ticks above the 12.2X five-year median but otherwise nowhere near the 18.7X five-year high. And the current PEG ratio works out to 0.7X, reflective of both growth and value. The stock sports a Style Score of 'A' for Value.\nSaum Sutaria, CEO, wrapped up the quarterly release with a bullish statement:\n'Our businesses continue to produce strong results and generate robust free cash flow with same store revenue growth and profitability well above our expectations due to the focused execution of our strategy and disciplined operations,'\nHe continued \u2013\n'We have furthered our portfolio transformation and are well-positioned to deliver enhanced value to our patients, physician partners, and shareholders.'\nBottom Line\nInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank \u2013 one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.\nStory Continues\nThe top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.\nTenet Healthcare Corp. would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nBear of the Day:\nStarbucks is a roaster and retailer of specialty coffee globally. Besides its fresh, rich-brewed coffees, the company's offerings include many complimentary food items and a selection of premium teas and other beverages, sold mainly through its retail stores.\nAnalysts have taken their earnings expectations lower, landing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\nLet's take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.\nStarbucks\nStarbucks shares have been volatile nearly all year long, up roughly 3% overall and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500. Quarterly results have been a source of volatility, with a recent CEO swap also causing the same.\nFor a quick refresher, former Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Brian Niccol replaced Laxman Narasimhan back in August. Investors remain hopeful that the swap will bring some positivity, particularly after the several-year-long patch of rough price action. Over the last three years, SBUX shares are down -10%.\nThe company's latest set of quarterly results was a bit rough, with global comparable store sales declining 7% but getting a slight boost from a 2% increase in average ticket. As has been the case, China continues to be a thorn in the side for SBUX, with comparable store sales in China falling 14% alongside an 8% decline in average ticket price.\nThe China story has been a big deal for obvious reasons \u2013 the region accounts for 30% of the company's stores overall. Below is a chart illustrating the company's sales on a quarterly basis.\nNonetheless, fresh CEO Brian Niccol remains positive, stating:\n'It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers. 'Back to Starbucks' is that fundamental change,'\nHe continued -\n'My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great experience, our customers will come back. We have a clear plan and are moving quickly to return Starbucks to growth.'\nBottom Line\nAnalysts' negative revisions rolled in following the release of its latest quarterly results, with weak China sales continuing to be a thorn in the company's side.\nStarbucks is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.\nFor those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). These stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook and the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.\nAdditional content:\nBuy 3 Tech Stocks with Extensive AI Applications Amid Solid Upside\nThe astonishing rally in U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. The prime factor was the unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology worldwide.\nLately, a section of market analysts and financial researchers have raised concerns about the potential profitability of massive investments in generative AI by several technology giants. We believe that AI applications will continue to gather pace in the coming years, buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet.\nAt this stage, we recommend three technology behemoths with extensive applications of generative AI. These companies are - Alphabet Inc., Adobe Inc. and Broadcom Inc..\nBuy 3 Tech Giants with Extensive AI Applications\nThese three companies have beaten their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom lines in third-quarter 2024. These stocks have solid price upside potential in the short term.\nIn the long term, these stocks have a higher earnings per share (EPS) growth rate than the broad-market S&P 500 index, which should drive their stock prices in the next 3 to 5 years. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nAlphabet Inc.\nA deepening focus on generative AI technology is a major positive for GOOGL in this data-driven world. Google has been well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\nAlphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI (Gen AI) solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products. GOOGL's strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers.\nAlphabet's expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. GOOGL's dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance the search results continue to boost traffic on GOOGL's search engine.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nIn addition, GOOGL's Vertex AI enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models. These generative AI capabilities are aiding GOOGL in enhancing search results, accelerating Android development, boosting healthcare reach and delivering enhanced cloud experience.\nExcellent Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 21.6% from the last closing price of $169.24. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$235. This indicates a maximum upside of 38.9% and no downside.\nAlphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12% and 11.4%, respectively, for 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 2.8% in the last seven days. GOOGL currently has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 17.6%, higher than the S&P 500's long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%.\nAdobe Inc.\nAdobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster.\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\nThese services help businesses streamline marketing and products for targeted consumer groups, including chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers.\nAdobe is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products. ADBE's Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are driving top-line growth. The major positives are rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps.\nGrowth in emerging markets and robust online video creation demand remain tailwinds. Additionally, solid demand for Adobe's commerce offerings and the growing adoption of Acrobat are encouraging. Adobe's strong market position, compelling product lines and continued innovation remain positive.\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\nRobust Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 26.2% from the last closing price of $481.35. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.2% in the last 60 days. ADBE currently has a long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%, in line with the S&P 500.\nBroadcom Inc.\nBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers. AVGO's solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers.\nThe acquisition of VMware has benefited the Infrastructure software solutions of Broadcom. VMware's expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy. AVGO's strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\nSolid Price Upside Potential for AVGO Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.9% from the last closing price of $168.55. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $150-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 42.4% and a maximum downside of 18.6%.\nBroadcom has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 16.7% and 27.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2025 (ending October 2025).

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -3.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.7% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Broadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share, indicating a change of +25.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 points to a change of +14% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.13 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news.\nThe AI Boom in Big Tech is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon. This past week, artificial intelligence was the key focus for the Big Five, which together are valued at more than $10 trillion. The reporting season not only highlighted the push these big tech companies are making in AI investments but also demonstrated that they aren\u2019t afraid to take it up any further than they already have. Previously, concerns regarding the returns from substantial AI investments had led to negative investor sentiment and even triggered a sell-off in major AI plays. However, some results are demonstrating that AI investments may be worth the wait.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November\u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4.\n\u201cThe AI theme is intact if you\u2019re the mega caps,\u201d as companies show that they can monetize their investments while maintaining existing profitability. As long as that infrastructure continues to be built, then we continue to be in a good place for the broader AI trade\u201d.\nThat said, executives of the major AI plays have fair-warned that their AI splurges will continue next year. Tech giants are racing to secure high-end chips and build sprawling data centers, forging partnerships with energy providers and much more. Each company wants to prove to Wall Street that these investments will eventually lead to greater profitability as compared to their current businesses.\nRay Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, believes that only a handful of technology names will be able to come out at the top, especially considering the high costs related to AI. This makes the situation quite favorable for well-capitalized companies.\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAs companies ramp up their spending on AI, let\u2019s take a closer look at how other AI players are advancing to make headlines. For starters, Perplexity, an AI conversational search engine that uses large language models to answer queries, has announced a dedicated hub for US general election information. Even though the AI-powered search engine has been seen to hallucinate from time to time, the company is keen on showing its trustworthiness when it comes to tracking election results.\n\u201cStarting Tuesday, we\u2019ll be offering live updates on elections by leveraging data from The Associated Press so you can stay informed on presidential, senate, and house races at both a state and national level. Thank you to Democracy Works for granting us access to your Elections API to help power these experiences.\u201d\nStory Continues\nThe company\u2019s election hub provides answers to election-related questions, as well as AI-generated analyses on ballot measures, policy stances, candidates, and endorsements.\nIn other news, Noma Security, a stealth mode startup specializing in Enterprise, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence, is said to be developing tools to identify vulnerable data pipelines and code in data science environments, as well as threats like prompt injection attacks.\n\u201cExisting tools are designed for the traditional software lifecycle. However, the data and AI lifecycle is inherently different. It involves distinct R&D processes, relies on different technologies, and faces unique technical vulnerabilities within AI models.\u201d \u2013 CEO Niv Braun\nTalking about the AI pioneer OpenAI, reports from Bloomberg state that the company is in talks with California\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office about the process of becoming a for-profit entity. While a shift to being a for-profit company would mark a drastic reversal in the governance structure for the company, the move would also make the firm more attractive to investors.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nHow Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Revolutionizing AI Workloads with VeloRAIN?\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American technology company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. This AI chip play is one of the leading players designing chips for companies that are building AI data centers.\nOn November 5th, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced major innovations, services, and partnerships aimed at accelerating and optimizing enterprise AI workloads. The company has introduced \u201cVeloRAIN\u201d, a new AI-powered networking architecture, along with two high-performance edge appliances and even a partner program called Titan that will support enterprise AI workloads beyond data centers.\n\u201cVeloRAIN is the foundation of our AI networking innovation, empowering our entire portfolio to better address the demands of enterprise AI workloads. By harnessing the advanced capabilities of VeloRAIN, AI workloads from distributed inferencing and agentic peer-to-peer applications to upstream heavy RAG transactions will see improved application-based QoE and security across all endpoints of the enterprise. We look forward to collaborating with our global partner ecosystem via Titan, our new partner program to provide more enterprises with the next generation of infrastructure necessary to support such current and future AI workloads.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Broadcom\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nWhat's The Opportunity In Broadcom?\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 7.87% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Broadcom today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $161.21, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Broadcom\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from Broadcom?\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Broadcom. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? AVGO\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AVGO, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nIf you want to dive deeper into Broadcom, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that you should not miss.\nData center investments by hyperscalers to leap ahead in the artificial intelligence (AI) race are a hot topic on Wall Street. A latest study into the matter by consulting firm McKinsey sheds further light on the European market in this regard. According to the McKinsey report, data center power consumption in Europe is set to nearly triple by 2030, necessitating a significant increase in electricity supply, particularly from low-carbon sources, along with upgrades to grid infrastructure. McKinsey estimates that the total IT load demand from data centers in Europe is expected to grow to approximately 35 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, up from 10 GW presently. Current trends also indicate that data center power consumption in the region is anticipated to triple to over 150 terawatt hours (TWh) by the end of this decade.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe report further reveals that data centers are expected to represent about 5% of Europe\u2019s total power consumption in the next six years, compared to roughly 2% at present. Meeting this growing demand will require a minimum investment of around $300 billion in data center infrastructure, excluding power generation capacity. The report also highlighted that satisfying the increased electricity demand will require a substantial boost in supply, which represents a significant shift for Europe, where overall power demand has remained largely unchanged since 2007. Kevin Restivo of CBRE recently highlighted that demand for data center space in Europe is set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American multinational designer, developer, manufacturer, and global supplier of a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Susquehanna on October 21 released an investor note on the semi industry, noting that companies with an artificial intelligence focus continued to thrive, while semiconductor stocks with heavy auto/industrial exposure faced headwinds. Susquehanna analysts, led by Chris Rolland, claimed that AI-focused semis appeared to be in good shape, as Susquehanna expected hyperscale and data center capital expenditures to continue to climb. With reference to Broadcom, the analysts pointed out that the bar had been raised for most AI stocks as prior AI guidance would likely need to be raised to support stock prices.\nOverall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss.

          "whole_article": "The astonishing rally in U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. The prime factor was the unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology worldwide.\nLately, a section of market analysts and financial researchers have raised concerns about the potential profitability of massive investments in generative AI by several technology giants. We believe that AI applications will continue to gather pace in the coming years, buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet.\nAt this stage, we recommend three technology behemoths with extensive applications of generative AI. These companies are - Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nBuy 3 Tech Giants With Extensive AI Applications\nThese three companies have beaten their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom lines in third-quarter 2024. These stocks have solid price upside potential in the short term.\nIn the long term, these stocks have a higher earnings per share (EPS) growth rate than the broad-market S&P 500 index, which should drive their stock prices in the next 3 to 5 years. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nAlphabet Inc.\nA deepening focus on generative AI technology is a major positive for GOOGL in this data-driven world. Google has been well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\nAlphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI (Gen AI) solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products. GOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance the search results continue to boost traffic on GOOGL\u2019s search engine.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nStory Continues\nIn addition, GOOGL\u2019s Vertex AI enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models. These generative AI capabilities are aiding GOOGL in enhancing search results, accelerating Android development, boosting healthcare reach and delivering enhanced cloud experience.\nExcellent Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 21.6% from the last closing price of $169.24. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$235. This indicates a maximum upside of 38.9% and no downside.\nAlphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12% and 11.4%, respectively, for 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 2.8% in the last seven days. GOOGL currently has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 17.6%, higher than the S&P 500\u2019s long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAdobe Inc.\nAdobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster.\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\nThese services help businesses streamline marketing and products for targeted consumer groups, including chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers.\nAdobe is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products. ADBE\u2019s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are driving top-line growth. The major positives are rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps.\nGrowth in emerging markets and robust online video creation demand remain tailwinds. Additionally, solid demand for Adobe\u2019s commerce offerings and the growing adoption of Acrobat are encouraging. Adobe\u2019s strong market position, compelling product lines and continued innovation remain positive.\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\nRobust Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 26.2% from the last closing price of $481.35. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703. This indicates a maximum upside of 46% and a maximum downside of 8.6%.\nAdobe has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.9% and 12.4%, respectively, for next year (ending November 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.2% in the last 60 days. ADBE currently has a long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%, in line with the S&P 500.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBroadcom Inc.\nBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers. AVGO\u2019s solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers.\nThe acquisition of VMware has benefited the Infrastructure software solutions of Broadcom. VMware\u2019s expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy. AVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\nSolid Price Upside Potential for AVGO Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.9% from the last closing price of $168.55. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $150-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 42.4% and a maximum downside of 18.6%.\nBroadcom has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 16.7% and 27.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2025 (ending October 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.4% in the last 60 days. AVGO currently has a long-term EPS growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500\u2019s long-term EPS growth rate of 13.1%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this chipmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 2.59%, on average, in the last two quarters.\nFor the last reported quarter, Broadcom Inc. Came out with earnings of $1.24 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 per share, representing a surprise of 3.33%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.10 per share, delivering a surprise of 1.85%.\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Broadcom Inc. Lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nBroadcom Inc. Currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.24%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nStory Continues\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nServiceNow (NOW) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 6.7%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That said, investors and analysts are excited to see what this earnings period has to offer for the magnificent seven and how much of an influence they have on the market. On October 31, Christian Dery, head of macro strategy at Capital Fund Management, appeared in an interview\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the impact of the magnificent seven on the market.\nDery suggested that these companies have grown to become large entities and their market capitalization often fluctuates by $2 billion to $400 billion on earnings events. Looking at the dispersion of the index, Dery adds that individual stocks within the S&P are very diverse and more independent, hinting towards a very low correlation in the index.\nHe adds that generative AI and LLMs are very different from the traditional software business. Therefore, the hyperscaling model that is conventionally taken from software can not be applied here. For every new customer in the software business, the marginal cost often goes down to nearly zero. However, if you look at the \u201ctech incumbents\u201d, they have to increase their capital expenditures to develop compute clusters and scale their operations, suggests Dery.\nIn 2023, the chips industry generated revenue of about $3 billion, reflecting that we are yet to find a killer use case or see results of generous AI spending. Dery adds that the market is more likely to be \u201cdiscerning\u201d on the path to profitability since companies are going to focus more on capital expenditures and projections for capital expenditures. He is particularly interested in the CapEx projections of the Magnificent Seven and shares that if they miss there could be a negative reaction among those stocks.\nDery reiterated that the market is yet to see the investments pay off multiple times but maintains his interest in capital expenditures by these companies playing out. While he is bullish on technological innovation and believes artificial intelligence is disruptive and a \u201cbig deal\u201d, he fails to see viable results as of now. Dery also emphasizes that these companies are directing their investments to AI because they do not want to fall behind competitors, with no proper timeline for AI monetization.\nStory Continues\nThat said, some companies are investing heavily in innovation and are at the forefront of a technological revolution.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we went over multiple similar rankings on the internet from credible financial websites. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NOW)'s AI Innovations Drive Revenue Growth and Strategic Partnerships\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software company that helps companies manage digital workflows and operations using its cloud computing platform. The company\u2019s Now Platform allows businesses to leverage AI to enhance productivity, automate workflows, scale for growth, and improve security.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) generated $2.79 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from the same quarter in 2023. Of this, subscription revenue was worth $2.72 billion, representing a growth rate of 23%. The company attributes this momentum to customers doubling down on ServiceNow as a leading AI platform for operational efficacy and business transformation. The company itself is confident in its future performance as the demand for AI continues to grow.\nDuring the quarter, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) processed its largest AI release to date, the Now Platform Xanadu release. The release encompasses hundreds of new and improved AI capabilities and generative AI solutions for the telecom, media, technology, and financial services industries. In addition to that, the company also partnered with NVIDIA to co-develop AI agents using Nvidia\u2019s blueprints in the ServiceNow platform. To align with its expansion strategy, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) also forged separate partnerships with Siemens, Rimini Street, and Pearson to develop AI use cases for different industries and customer segments.\nOverall, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an investor favorite because of its quality deals with major players in the industry. Similarly, the company has high growth expectations for the full fiscal year and the fourth quarter of 2024, contributing to its ranking as one of the best innovative stocks according to hedge funds.\nIthaka Group\u2019\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFounded in 2004,\u00a0ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW) has become the leading provider of cloud-based software solutions that define, structure, manage and automate workflow services for global enterprises. ServiceNow pioneered the use of the cloud to deliver IT service management (\u201cITSM\u201d) applications. These applications allow users to manage incidents and to plan new IT projects, provision clouds, manage application performance and build applications themselves. The company has since expanded beyond the ITSM market to provide workflow solutions for IT operations management, customer support, human resources, security operations and other enterprise departments where a patchwork of semi-automated processes have been used with varying success in the past. ServiceNow\u2019s stock appreciated in the quarter on the back of strong earnings that beat Street estimates on the top and bottom line, with the company pointing to strength in subscription revenues, cRPO, operating margins, and continued demand for the company\u2019s AI products.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Arista Networks ANET, Tesla TSLA and ServiceNow NOW.\n3 Momentum Stocks About to Surge (TSLA, NOW, ANET)\nOne of my favorite ways to pick winning stocks by combining two of the most effective methods out there; the Zacks Rank and momentum. The Zacks Rank is a highly effective quantitative strategy that aggregates all analyst ratings of a stock and converts them into a simple ranking. Momentum is one of the most well documented edge and is well known as a premier anomaly for investors to utilize for successful trading.\nTogether, these two techniques have helped me detect dozens of huge winners in the stock market and right now they have identified three highly compelling stock picks. Arista Networks, Tesla and ServiceNow all boast a top Zacks Rank and an A+ technical momentum setup, leading me to believe that they may be huge winners in the coming weeks and months.\nTesla: Bullish Setup and Strong Buy Stock\nTesla stock has been on a rather volatile and uncertain path this year as electric vehicle sales have slowed markedly. However, CEO Elon Musk is a master of surprising to the upside, and with humanoid robots, self-driving cars and a multitude of other side-bets within Tesla, there is always the potential for a huge run in the stock.\nOver the last two months, analysts have started to upgrade their earnings estimates for Tesla, and it now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 13.4% over the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have jumped by 7.5% over the same period.\nBut most notable is the technical chart pattern forming in Tesla stock price. After gapping higher following its quarterly earnings report, the price action has been building a highly compelling descending wedge. If the stock can trade above the $250 level, it would signal a breakout and may send the stock on another major bull run. Alternatively, if it loses the $240 level of support, the pattern will be invalidated, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.\nArista Networks: Stock Breaking out Now\nArista Networks, a leading provider of high-performance networking solutions primarily for data centers and cloud computing, is another stock to watch. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, ANET also boasts strong earnings growth forecasts and sits in the top 13% of the Zacks Industry Rank.\nOver the next three to five years, Arista Networks is projected to increase its earnings per share by an impressive 15.3% annually. Sales are also expected to grow nicely, with estimates of a 16.3% increase this year and 17.4% next year.\nStory Continues\nArista Networks stock is also breaking out of its technical pattern today. After building out a bull flag over the last month, ANET is staging a clear breakout. If the stock can hold above the $400 level, it should be the start of another rally. However, if it reverses and loses the breakout level, it may be a sign that the stock needs more time before climbing higher.\nServiceNow: Poised for Growth and a Bullish Breakout\nServiceNow is a cloud computing company that offers a suite of software solutions for IT service management, human resources, customer service, and more. These products help organizations automate routine tasks, enhance productivity, and improve employee and customer experience.\nServiceNow is a rapidly growing technology company that also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Earnings are projected to grow 24.7% annually over the next three to five years, while sales are expected to climb 22.3% this year and 20.1% next year.\nLike the other two stocks, NOW stock looks to be developing a very bullish technical pattern. After beating earnings estimates and gapping higher, the price action has been consolidating into a picture-perfect bull flag. Today, NOW stock is bumping up against the upper level of resistance, and if it can break out above the $955 level, it should send the stock significantly higher. However, if it loses the $930 level of support, investors may want to hold off and wait for other opportunities.\nShould Investors Buy NOW, ANET and TSLA Shares?\nThe current setups for Arista Networks, Tesla, and ServiceNow are quite convincing, blending strong fundamental growth with technical momentum. Each company boasts robust earnings growth forecasts, competitive market positions, and favorable chart patterns, making them solid candidates for those seeking high-potential momentum plays.\nFor investors with an appetite for growth and momentum, NOW, ANET, and TSLA offer a balanced blend of technical and fundamental indicators suggesting strong performance ahead. As always, keeping an eye on key price levels and being a keen risk manager will be key for trading them successfully.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

          "whole_article": "The market for ServiceNow, Inc.'s (NYSE:NOW) shares didn't move much after it posted weak earnings recently. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nSee our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nearnings-and-revenue-history\nZooming In On ServiceNow's Earnings\nOne key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.\nServiceNow has an accrual ratio of -0.40 for the year to September 2024. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$3.4b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$1.34b. ServiceNow shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On ServiceNow's Profit Performance\nAs we discussed above, ServiceNow's accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is a positive for the company. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that ServiceNow's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at an extremely impressive rate over the last three years. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing ServiceNow at this point in time. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for ServiceNow and you'll want to know about these.\nStory Continues\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of ServiceNow's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "Bill McDermott is very intense.\u00a0When he first joined ServiceNow as CEO in 2019\u2014he was previously CEO of SAP\u2014he met all 7,000 employees and shook hands with every single one of them.\n\u201cIn the first hundred days I was here, I travelled the whole world. The whole world. I met every single person that works for this company in person, and shook their hand.\u201d\nHandshake intensity is a thing, in McDermott's world.\nThe first handshake is incredibly important, he says. It\u2019s part of his mindset, especially for dealing with clients. He advises sales people, upon entering a room with a prospective client, to \u201cfind the decision-maker and shake his hand, but be the last one to let go.\u201d\nHe spoke to Fortune recently in a penthouse suite at the Four Seasons hotel in London, during a business trip to meet clients.\nQuestion 1: Does this handshake thing really work?\n\u201cYes, it does.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not a perfunctory exercise to greet somebody. It's not a perfunctory exercise to shake somebody's hand. They have to know you're in the room and you have to let them know that you care,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo just to shake hands as if it's just some standard thing to do is not enough.\u201d\n(So, was my handshake any good? \u201cYou were fine. I wasn't judging you.\u201d)\nMcDermott\u2019s stewardship of ServiceNow is certainly working. Five years later, ServiceNow has 26,000 employees, revenues of $2.8 billion per quarter and a market cap of more than $195 billion.\nThe AI-driven enterprise software company counts clients such as IBM, KPMG, and Deloitte, for whom it provides a vast range of back-end software that handles customer service, IT operations, security, and new employee on-boarding, among dozens of other services.\nThe handshake thing is a good example of McDermott\u2019s intense, driven style. This is a man who only sleeps for five hours a night. He wakes up at 5 a.m., reads three newspapers, drinks an espresso, does a light workout and walks his dog, Amber. He\u2019s in the office by 8 a.m. He usually continues working until 11 p.m. at night.\nQuestion 2: Can you really get by on just five hours\u2019 sleep?\n\u201cFive hours a night, you know, which is fine,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the week, you know, like it's \u2018go time.\u2019\u201d\nHe sleeps a bit more on weekends.\nQuestion 3: Does ServiceNow have supply issues with Nvidia?\nMost products offered by ServiceNow are driven by AI.\nSo is he getting what he needs from Nvidia, the AI chipmaker that has been accused of not being able to meet demand for all its customers?\n\u201cPerhaps we're fortunate because we have such a strategic relationship but Nvidia has fulfilled all of our requirements and done a great job,\u201d he says.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe started building models with Jensen [Huang, the CEO] several years ago, and we were the first mover in enterprise software building with Nvidia's GPU stack.\u201d\nQuestion 4: Will you cave to Robby Starbuck?\nMcDermott isn\u2019t afraid of the usual culture-war controversies that have come to bedevil leaders at large corporations. ServiceNow, for instance, has a well-developed, public facing DEI program, of the type that has lately become unfashionable.\nRobby Starbuck\u2014the conservative activist who organizes boycotts of companies that he believes are too \u201cwoke\u201d\u2014recently forced Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson, among others, to back away from their DEI initiatives.\nSo what will McDermott do if Starbuck comes calling?\n\u201cWell the good news about ServiceNow is we haven't played \u2018acronym bingo,\u2019\u201d McDermott says.\n\u201cIf you're not growing and you're managing and all you talk about is corporate acronyms, that could be a problem for that phone call. But when you're growing like we are, we have to source talent from every corner of the earth to keep up with the pace of our growth. So if we didn't believe in diversity, if we didn't have an equitable and an inclusive culture, there's no way we could be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. So I think that call would be pretty simple.\u201d\nQuestion 5: Is working remotely OK?\nMcDermott is not a fan of 100% remote working. He asked the company to return to the office about two years ago. ServiceNow currently has a flexible policy in which some employees come in two days a week unless they are designated remote workers.\n\u201cI believe strongly that people do their best work in person.\u201d\n\u201cWe need everybody in the company to cross-pollinate and innovate and work as teams. So, basically, when I asked the company to do it, I didn't have to mandate it. I just had to say, we need it now, we have to hit the accelerator, people came back.\u201d\nBut when the CEO says \u201cwe need it now,\u201d surely that's a mandate?\n\u201cIf they trust you, it's not a mandate. It's a desire. It is \u2018I need you. I trust you. I want you with me.\u2019 I'm not telling you I have to have you tied to a chair, and I'm not telling you I'm going to fire you if you don't do it. I'm telling you, I need you to do it and I don't ask for things that I don't need. And they responded next day, the parking lots are all full. There\u2019s a difference between leading and managing and I don't think it's healthy to actually have people that feel forced into things,\u201d he says. \u201cOne volunteer is worth 10 pressed people.\u201d\nQuestion 6: Are you a micromanager or do you prefer to delegate?\nThis question is important because McDermott has, in the past, insisted on riding along on sales calls with his staff.\n\u201cI hire people that are the best in the world at what they do and I trust them with my life. I think trust is the ultimate human currency and I think the best leaders hire people that are substantially better than them. In every area of domain expertise. So, if you have a CFO, they have to be better than you at finance. If you have a CHRO, they have to know more about the people equation than you do. If you hire a head of engineering, they have to be an extraordinary exemplar of an engineering manager and they should know a lot more than you do. In other words, when I look around the table of my leadership team, I'm humbled, that's how good they are.\u201d\n\u201cI also believe strongly that we have to go into the details and we have to be with our customers and we have to be shoulder to shoulder with the customer so you understand the pain that they deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cI become obsessed with their problems. And I want 26,000 people to be obsessed with their problems, so we come up with new solutions to make them better.\u201d\nQuestion 7: What is the most difficult thing you have tackled as CEO?\nGrowing the company from 7,000 people to 26,000 must have involved some difficulties. But McDermott won't admit it.\n\u201cI love scale. I came here from a company that had a hundred thousand people. So my whole life has been spent scaling companies, so the things that people might find difficult, we find great joy in, we bring new people into the culture, we get new people to buy into the\u00a0purpose.\u201d\nThat sounds like PR spin. Surely there must have been pain points while growing ServiceNow?\n\u201cI've encountered thousands of challenges, but is that a difficulty? Or is that a challenge? Is that A setback? Or is that an opportunity,\u201d he says.\nAnd then, just in case you needed a reminder of the level of intensity he is working at, he adds:\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what is pain? Your pain might be my pleasure.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Top findings include a group of AI Pacesetters\u2014government organizations relatively more advanced in using AI and other emerging technologies\u2014that are driving efficiency and achieving better outcomes than organizations that have been slower to adopt AI-powered workflows and automation. Key insights illuminate the unique ways Pacesetters use AI to improve citizen and employee experiences, strengthen compliance, and scale business processes.\nAccording to the research, many government organizations have yet to reap the full benefits of digital technology and relatively few are leveraging innovation to advance their diverse missions. The report outlines best practices implemented by Pacesetters that can be replicated in other government organizations to improve outcomes.\n\"In today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, governments need AI-driven solutions to meet the evolving expectations of citizens and employees,\" said Jonathan Alboum, Federal CTO at ServiceNow. \"This report reinforces that leading governments are already reaping the benefits of AI through accelerated service delivery, citizen experience, and employee productivity. Whether you\u2019re a Pacesetter or still in the beginning stages of a digital journey, these findings show that the future is promising for those willing to embrace AI.\"\nKey findings from The State of AI-Powered Transformation in Government include:\nImproving Speed of Mission\nPacesetters significantly improve their speed and agility by integrating automation into their organizations\u2019 processes. This profoundly impacts both government employees and the citizens they serve.\nFaster time to value with more benefits. Most Pacesetters (61%) achieve a 1.5X faster return on digital investments and report greater outcomes from those investments \u2013 including higher asset utilization and return (50%), improved compliance and risk management (49%), and faster public services (41%).\nAutomating workflows with end-to-end platforms. Pacesetters are making greater progress in implementing end-to-end platforms, with 67% expecting to make advanced progress within the next three years. Currently, 59% have invented new cross-functional workflows that leverage human and AI collaboration.\nAccelerating productivity and ability to scale transformation. Pacesetters boost productivity via specific digital solutions, such as mobile apps (64%), performance management systems (43%), and AI-enabled tools (38%). Those investments are paying off for Pacesetters, measured by improved staff retention (49%), employee upskilling and reskilling (44%), and productivity (41%).\nStory Continues\nAI-Powered Citizen Service Delivery\nPacesetters are finding new momentum within their Citizen Experience (CX) efforts through unique uses of AI and other digital solutions. This is not only improving citizen service delivery but also helping build trust.\nReshaping government services with AI. Governments are using AI in various ways to accelerate citizen service delivery. The top uses for AI among Pacesetters include personalization of citizen communication and engagement, continuous service improvement with feedback loops, and citizen queries and recommendations.\nTechnology improves citizen experience and builds trust. Pacesetters are making greater use of apps and automation to reach citizens. Compared to the general population of government agencies in our survey, Pacesetters are more likely to deploy mobile apps that citizens can use to access government services (47%), digital identities for easy and secure access to public services (46%), and automated responses to citizen problems or requests (44%).\nTech investments are beginning to drive CX improvements.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the UBS' Top Tech Based Disruptive Stocks For 2030: Top 29 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other tech based disruptive stocks.\nWhen it comes to investing and making massive gains on the stock market, disruption is the name of the game. The biggest firms on the market right now are all disruptors of their industries. These firms have ushered in new products and used technology to allow consumers to improve their daily lives.\nSince the word disruption is well used in stock market discourse, a brief history lesson is in order. The term disruptive innovation was popularized by the late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. Despite being widely used, disruption innovation is far from being a widespread effect. In essence, while all disruptive innovation is innovation, not all innovation is disruptive innovation. To understand how, consider an HBR article co authored by Professor Christensen. In it, the authors share that \"too many people who speak of \u201cdisruption\u201d have not read a serious book or article on the subject.\"\nTruly disruptive firms end up anticipating the needs of customers that larger incumbents ignore, believe Christensen and his compatriots. This enables the entrants to establish a foothold in the market, after which they upscale their products to also target the customers that incumbents are focused on. However, a firm doesn't have to be an entrant in its industry to be a disruptor, as the authors point to the iPhone's success in leveraging existing business processes that truly reshaped the course of the world.\nConsequently, in order to analyze the stock market returns offered by disruptive innovation, a good place to start would be to see the share price of firms that Professor Christensen believes are disruptors. The article provides two examples; one is of the firm responsible for the iPhone and the other is of the company that is dominating the global streaming market.\nStarting from the former, its shares are up by a whopping 209,000%+ since they started trading on the NASDAQ exchange. The latter is a relatively newer entrant to the stock market. The stock started to trade in 2002, and since then, it has gained 61,000%+. Mind you, both of these are calculated after stock splits. Safe to say, disruption is rewarding, but to understand its impact on the share price of the former company, we'll have to dig in slightly deeper.\nUsing post split stock prices, before the launch of the iPhone, the shares had gained roughly 3,800%. Since the launch of the iPhone, the stock is up by almost 4,600%, despite the higher base effect of the higher share price and the global stock market disruption during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID 19 recession. In today's AI driven market, the firm is one of the most valuable companies in the world courtesy of its $3.51 trillion market capitalization.\nStory Continues\nSince disruption often occurs on market fringes, it's hard to predict which firm will be the next one to shake things up. Using Christensen's criteria, the world's preeminent AI GPU manufacturer whose shares are up 727% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT isn't a disruptor. This is because it offers its products and services to customers that it serves already, while true disruptors are those that might end up gaining market popularity by catering to customers that are ignored by large incumbents due to profitability or other factors.\nAnother great example of disruption, or what Christensen terms as 'big bang disruption' is in the gaming console market. For years, two gaming consoles, namely the Xbox and the PlayStation have dominated the market. Within these, the PlayStation is the original disruptor and a device that dealt a deadly blow to the arcade industry. In American culture, Pinball holds a pivotal place, especially for those who were growing up in the pre internet era.\nData from Harvard shows that Pinball sales in the US peaked at roughly 1.3 million units in 1993, despite the fact that arcade video games had already become available since 1978. However, from the 1.3 million units in 1993, the sales dropped to less than 5 million in just a couple of years in 1997. This was because the PlayStation was launched in 1994, and by 1997, its sales had surged to 20 million. A key differentiating factor for the console that enabled its meteoric rise was its popularity. The PlayStation at the time was available for $299 while Pinball machines could cost as much as $7,500. The console also offered more video game variety, and it allowed children and adolescents to enjoy gaming from the comfort of their homes. In short, the video game console served the needs of players ignored by Pinball (those who wanted to play at home), and its 'big bang' occurred when the console caught on with the broader Pinball market.\nTherein lie the secrets to disruption. With these details in mind, let's look at UBS' latest list of firms that can use technology to disrupt their industries. The bank believes that \"these are leading disruptors in sectors undergoing technological transformation, which should lead to consequential and enduring impact\" to allow them to deliver \"superior earnings growth.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will use technology to disrupt their industries, we divided the 29 stocks in UBS latest report into two categories. The first lists OTC stocks by their year to date share price gains, while the second ranks US listed stocks by the number of hedge fund shareholders during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software as a service (SaaS) firm that provides business process management products and services. This means that the stock and the firm's revenue are dependent on business activity which is influenced by economic health. Consequently, as the economy has continued to chug along in 2024, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s stock is up 38% year to date. Over its four latest quarters, the firm has raked in $1.3 billion in trailing twelve month net income on the back of continued deal diversification. Through this, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) grew its customers with recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% in Q2, and it added six new customers with annual contract value greater than $10 million in Q3. These metrics are key for SaaS companies like ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) as they help broaden the revenue base and add margin heavy revenue to the income statement.\nDuring the Q3 2024 earnings call, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s management shared key details about its deals:\n\"From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was very strong, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Retail and Hospitality also had a fantastic quarter, growing over 80% year-over-year. Health care and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date, U.S. Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution, further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and two over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers.\nOverall NOW ranks 8th on our list of UBS' top tech based disruptive stocks for 2030. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of Jefferies\u2019 Top Crowded Software Long Positions: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks.\nAfter the post-pandemic rush and the subsequent inflation and glut-driven crash experienced by technology stocks, the sector is now fully bathing in the tailwinds and headwinds generated by artificial intelligence. Yet, unlike the pandemic, inflation, and interest rate-driven effects, AI has grown the addressable market for technology companies and shaken up several of them as well.\nWithin technology, one sector that has been shaken by AI is the software industry. Before AI, software firms were content with generating stable subscription-driven recurring revenue, but with AI, investors are not only focused on their ability to deliver AI products and monetize them but also on the fact that the firms themselves might be made redundant because of the new technology.\nNowhere else is the latter effect clearer than on software as a service (SaaS) stocks. These stocks offer software products on a subscription basis, and their narrative is based on their ability to deliver technologically complex products that businesses are unwilling to develop because of costs. The impact that AI has made on the SaaS sector is driven by the opinion that as AI enables users to easily create their software, several SaaS companies might not be needed in the business world.\nTo understand how AI has impacted software stocks, consider data from hedge fund\u00a0Coatue Management. It shows that booming AI interest has led to software stocks taking the back seat as semiconductor stocks bask in investor attention. During the SaaS peak of 2022, the difference between the returns offered by a SaaS stock index and the semiconductor index were at their highest for the past decade. But, as of June 2024, the difference between the semi and the SaaS index is at the highest for the past decade in a 180-degree paradigm shift driven by AI.\nThese returns have also been driven by the beefy margins delivered by the semiconductor firms. Margins are a key valuation driver of SaaS stocks, and one popular valuation tool among investors is the Rule of 40. This rule sums up a SaaS stock\u2019s revenue growth rate and profit or operating margin and checks whether the new value is greater than 40. As a result, margins play a key role in SaaS valuation, as a 40% or higher margin means that the firm can get away with little to no growth.\nStory Continues\nWhy is 40% important? Well,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coatue, as of June 2024, Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock pick and the stock that ranked\u00a06th\u00a0in our list of the\u00a010 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years\u00a0had operating margins of 65% and 49%, respectively. On the flip side, the largest software company in the world known for its Windows operating system had a margin of 44%. For chip stocks, new products drive margins since they can charge a premium through high prices. Whether these margins are sustained is another matter, and it was also part of the reason that the GPU firms\u2019 shares fell by 6% as its full-year margin gross guidance of mid-70 % fell short of analyst expectations of 76.4%.\nComing back to software stocks, another metric used in their valuation is the price-to-sales ratio since several software and SaaS firms are unprofitable. In the era of AI, the SaaS index quoted by Coatue is trading at 5.5x price to forward sales. This is well below the long-term median of 7.2x and just a quarter of the 2021 peak of roughly 22x. This valuation compression is accompanied by lower revenue growth estimates. As mentioned above, growth is a fundamental tenet of SaaS and software valuation, and as of June 2024, just one percent of software companies had a next twelve-month revenue growth rate greater than 30%. At the peak of the software boom, 30% of firms faced similar expectations. Digging deeper, several factors are driving this trend.\nAI is affecting SaaS stocks by making them shift to a consumption-driven model that charges customers for the services used instead of seat-based packages that simply sell capacity. Additionally, software stocks are also reckoning with the fact that their customers might end up using AI to cost-effectively develop their software instead of relying on expensive third-party options. As Jensen Huang shared in a 2021\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, well before his firm\u2019s stock posted 1,100% in share price gains:\n\u201cAI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.\u201d\nSo, as the software industry undergoes a once-in-a-generation shift, it\u2019s important to see how institutional investors are positioning their trades. Its latest survey is historic as it shows that just 19% of institutional investors are overweight in software stocks, the lowest reading recorded since the survey started. The figure sat at 51% in January and dropped to 28% in July. Yet, even though investors are less overweight, they\u2019ve also reduced their short exposure as they\u2019ve shorted 54 software stocks as of October 11th \u2013 down from 73 in July. So, let\u2019s take a look at the stocks that they persist to be long in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Jefferies\u2019 top overcrowded software long positions, we ranked the top ten crowded long positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) Thrives with Strong Growth and Profitability\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 97\nShares Short % Of Outstanding: 1.88%\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the biggest SaaS companies in the world. The firm provides products that enable users to automate their business processes and manage human resource operations, IT operations, and others. The firm has raked in $1.1 billion in trailing twelve-month net income and its shares are up 33.5% year to date. Since it\u2019s a SaaS stock, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u2019s narrative depends on its ability to sustain revenue levels, maintain profitability, grow its customer base, and increase the portion of larger deals within the overall mix. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) appears to be executing well on these fronts. During the second quarter, the firm grew customers with annual recurring revenue greater than $20 million by 40% and its committed remaining performance obligations by 31% to a whopping $18.6 billion. The latter is a particularly important metric since it measures the money that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is nearly guaranteed to receive in the future. This helps evaluate the firm\u2019s future cash flows.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in\u00a0Adobe\u00a0and\u00a0ServiceNow\u00a0earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 6th on our list of Jefferies\u2019 top crowded software long positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.
