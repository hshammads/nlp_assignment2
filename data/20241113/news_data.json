He accepted Meta\u2019s arguments that some of its restrictions on its Facebook platform had legitimate business justifications.\nBut the judge rejected the company\u2019s main contention \u2014 that its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were good for consumers and not an effort to dominate the personal social-networking market. Boasberg left that issue to be decided at trial. He also ruled in favor of the FTC that Meta can\u2019t argue it needed the acquisitions to compete against Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\nThe lawsuit, filed in 2020, is one of two by the first Trump administration aimed at curtailing the power of the largest US tech platforms.\nDespite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC\u2019s chances at trial. \u201cPrevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIndeed, its positions at times strain this country\u2019s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.\u201d\nMeta said its defense is strong.\n\u201cWe are confident that the evidence at trial will show that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have been good for competition and consumers,\u201d Meta spokesperson Christopher Sgro said in a statement, adding that the FTC \u201cis wrongly continuing to assert that no deal is ever truly final, and businesses can be punished for innovating.\u201d\nThe FTC said the case will protect innovation.\n\u201cThis case, which began under President Trump and was refined during the Biden administration, represents a bipartisan effort to curtail Meta\u2019s monopoly power and restore competition to ensure freedom and innovation in the social media ecosystem,\u201d FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said in a statement.\nIn April, Meta asked Boasberg to dismiss the FTC\u2019s suit outright, without a trial, arguing that the agency can\u2019t prove consumers would be better off without its acquisitions of the two apps.\nStory Continues\nIn its suit, the antitrust agency alleged that the company illegally dominated the US personal social-networking market by buying up emerging rivals.\nThe judge is to schedule a trial date at a hearing this month.\nThe case is Federal Trade Commission v.

          "whole_article": "Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) are fighting two Supreme Court cases this year that they claim will flood the legal system with investor lawsuits if not decided in their favor.\nSo far, things aren't exactly going their way.\nNvidia\u2019s lawyers made their case before the high court on Wednesday and drew skepticism from justices across the ideological spectrum. The same happened to Meta\u2019s lawyers last week.\n\u201cIt just seems to me that you're asking us to engage in a kind of analysis that we are not very good at,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan, an appointee by Democratic President Barack Obama, told Nvidia\u2019s lawyer Neal Kumar Katyal.\nThe outcome of the cases could undermine or embolden future securities fraud litigants.\nNvidia argues that investors who sued the company alleging that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made false statements should be required to present more particular information in their lawsuit about what Huang knew at the time of his statements.\nThe investors claim that in 2017 and 2018, Huang knowingly departed from Nvidia\u2019s internal company data by misattributing the company\u2019s demand for chips to the video gaming market.\nJensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia, (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDemand at the time, the investors hypothesized, was actually driven by the more volatile market of cryptocurrency mining. That hypothesis relied on the opinion of a financial analyst who based his conclusion on publicly available documents, rather than Nvidia\u2019s company documents.\n\u201cThis is a highly technical subject, and I just don't understand how a court is opposed to be evaluating that at the pleading stage,\u201d Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, told Nvidia\u2019s lawyer.\nThe justices pressed Nvidia to explain why they should reverse a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, repeating a point they made in the case against Meta's Facebook argued last week.\nIn both cases, the appellate court allowed investors to proceed against the companies with proposed class-action securities fraud suits.\nYale Law School professor Jonathan Macey said he was surprised by the justices\u2019 questions in the Facebook case.\n\u201cOne thing that was amazing in the oral argument,\u201d he said, \u201cis you've got this kind of across-the-aisle alliance\u201d with conservative Justice Clarence Thomas to liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressing concerns that were \u201cvery pro-plaintiff.\u201d\nFacebook, for its part, said investors should not be able to allege that it misled its stockholders by omitting that its partnership with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users.\nStory Continues\nAt the core of both disputes are questions about what facts a plaintiff must include in a legal complaint to keep a case in court.\nFacebook argued that its disclosures were not false or misleading by failing to disclose that the Cambridge Analytica breach actually materialized in the past, especially because the so-called risk posed no known risk of ongoing or future business harm.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill in 2018.. (Photo by Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) \u00b7 Anadolu via Getty Images\nAccording to Nvidia, investors should not be able to maintain a proposed class-action lawsuit against the company by relying on an expert\u2019s opinion.\n\u201cCongress \u2026 wanted to stop lawsuits like this, lawsuits that allowed for fraud by hindsight,\u201d Katyal said on behalf of Nvidia during Wednesday\u2019s arguments.\n\u201cWhen a stock drops, all [plaintiffs] have to do is find an expert with numbers that contradict a company's public statements,\u201d Katyal said.\nKatyal went on to say that a decision in favor of the shareholders created \u201can easy road map\u201d for plaintiffs to evade a federal law that requires particular information to be included in a securities fraud complaint.\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), which was in part created to prevent frivolous lawsuits, states that a plaintiff must show that a defendant company intended to make a false or misleading statement and that the statement was, in fact, false.\nSupreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, also entertained the idea that the PSLRA may need refining.\nGorsuch said \u201cit beggars belief\u201d to think that a CEO, such as Huang, would have been unaware of the source of such a large portion of the company's income.\nJim Redwood, a securities law professor with Albany Law, doubted that Supreme Court would ultimately rule in favor of the investors, saying he expects both cases to be resolved in a manner that curbs future securities class action lawsuits.\n\u201cThe Facebook case is somewhat closer,\u201d he said, explaining that the social media company\u2019s case may be somewhat weaker than Nvidia\u2019s.\nThe Justice Department joined in the Nvidia case, siding with investors.\n\u201cWe think that the 9th Circuit correctly applied the standard here,\u201d the DOJ\u2019s lawyer said during arguments on Wednesday.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Virtual Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best virtual reality stocks.\nOverview of the Global VR Market\nVirtual Reality is a computer-generated simulation that allows users to interact with a three-dimensional environment. The four elements that characterize virtual reality and differentiate it from other technologies such as augmented reality and mixed reality are a 3D-simulated environment, immersion, sensory engagement, and realistic interactivity, as revealed by HP.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global virtual reality market size was valued at $25.11 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow from $32.64 billion in 2024 to $244.84 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 28.6% during the forecast period (2024-2032).\nRegion-wise, North America is expected to dominate the global VR market over the forecast period. Another rapidly growing region is Asia Pacific with growth driven by the rising demand for immersive technologies in emerging economies. China, one of the major distributors of head-mounted VR devices and other hardware, is forecasted to have the highest market share in the region. Simultaneously, Europe is the early adopter of virtual solutions in the automotive industry and will be experiencing significant growth, with Germany and the UK as its leading markets.\nHow is Virtual Reality Transforming Today's World?\nThe virtual reality devices used today have their foundation laid on the first head-mounted augmented reality display \"The Sword of Damocles\"\u00a0which was introduced by Ivan Sutherland in 1968. While firms such as Sega and Nintendo developed VR gaming systems in the 1980s and 1990s, it was not until the 2010s that high-quality VR headsets boasting powerful graphics and motion-tracking technology came to the market.\nWhile gaming has been driving the popularity of VR, the potential of the technology has been realized in a multitude of other industries. The American shipping company UPS committed to millions for the advanced training of its drivers, with the firm\u2019s industry-leading training powered by the use of virtual reality in an industrial training environment. Before drivers operate an actual delivery vehicle, the company's Driving Simulator provides realistic driving experiences.\nVirtual reality and augmented reality have also penetrated the healthcare sector as they offer transformative opportunities for medical training, patient care, and therapeutic interventions. The treatment domains in which these technologies are used to treat patients are diverse and include pediatric diagnostics and treatments, pain management, mental health, neurological disorders, surgery planning, intraoperative procedures, telemedicine, as well as post-operative and other rehabilitation therapies. The penetration is evident from the fact that the US FDA has authorized 69 medical devices that incorporate augmented reality and virtual reality.\nStory Continues\nVirtual Reality is also changing the game for the entertainment industry, especially for artists. Fortnite witnessed a record turnout of more than 12 million attendees to its virtual concert featuring the hip-hop superstar Travis Scott in 2020.\u00a0Therefore, VR applications continue to spread around today\u2019s world. The renowned luxury car manufacturer BMW has materialized virtual reality experiences in the automotive space. The company expanded its revolutionary driving experience with BMW M Mixed Reality which tends to blur the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds through state-of-the-art VR/MR technologies.\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nOur Methodology\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now, we utilized stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies with the highest market caps. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is an American multinational technology conglomerate behind social apps such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The company has moved beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences such as augmented, virtual, and mixed reality to enable the next evolution in social technology. The firm has two reportable segments including the \u2018Family of Apps\u2019 encompassing Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services, and the \u2018Reality Labs\u2019 which includes its virtual, augmented, and mixed reality-related consumer hardware, software, and content.\nMeta has made significant progress in Virtual and Augmented Reality. Meta Quest enables people to get together with friends or meet new ones in VR. The most recent virtual reality headset Meta Quest 3S is an unreal device with an unreal price. It has been referred to as the new VR headset to buy for a large chunk of people and one of the best gateways into VR yet. It surpasses the Quest 2 by having 2x faster GPU processing power and the same mixed reality experience with 4.5x the resolution and color.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) closed a good third quarter driven by AI progress across its apps and business. Total revenue was $40.59 billion, up 19% year-over-year. The firm is witnessing rapid adoption of Meta AI and Llama, which is rapidly becoming a standard across the industry. Meta also achieved milestones relevant to Reality Labs and the integration of AI and wearables. These include experiencing a strong demand for Ray-Ban Meta glasses, the introduction of its first full holographic AR glasses Orion, and the release of its newest Quest 3S.\nWith a strong product and business momentum as well as Meta\u2019s revolutionary technology from virtual and mixed reality to social experiences, the firm is a promising virtual reality stock to buy now. As of 2024\u2019s second quarter, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is held by 219 hedge funds.\nOverall, META ranks 2nd on our list of\u00a0 best virtual reality stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.\nThe president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act \u2014 and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech\u2019s future.\nTrump hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He\u2019s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election \u2014 and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn\u2019t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.\nBut Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.\nNow, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump\u2019s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech\u2019s major players.\nAntitrust regulation\nThe Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech\u2019s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business \u201cmore fair.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect\u2019s stop at a McDonald\u2019s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,\u201d explained director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.\nAI legislation\nGenerative AI didn\u2019t take the world by storm until well after Trump\u2019s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.\nFILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nRegulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there\u2019s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.\nThe Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump\u2019s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden\u2019s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.\nHowever, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.\n\u201cWe've seen when that happens,\u201d explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. \u201cWhen that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.\u201d\nTrump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.\nThe CHIPS Act and tariffs\nThe second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.\nBut Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.\n\u201cThe CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,\u201d Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.\nBut during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.\nTariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.\n\u201cHardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,\u201d explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.\n\u201cSo whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.\u201d\nThat could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

          "whole_article": "(Reuters) -Meta Platforms plans to introduce advertisements to its social media app Threads early next year, the Information reported on Wednesday, citing three people with direct knowledge of the plans.\nThreads app was launched in July last year as a challenger to X, formerly Twitter, in a bid to win users from the de facto micro-blogging site during its chaotic takeover by billionaire Elon Musk.\nThe app hit 275 million monthly active users, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last month, a sign of its rapid growth.\nThreads is planning to allow a small number of advertisers create and publish ads on the app starting in January, according to the report.\nA team inside Instagram's advertising division is leading the initiative, the report said.\nMeanwhile, Meta does not expect Threads to be \"a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue,\" CFO Susan Li said on a post-earnings call in October.\nShe also said that the company plans to introduce more features on the app.\n\"Since our priority is to build consumer value first and foremost, there are no ads or monetization features currently on Threads,\" a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed response.\nThreads could attract advertisers from X at a time when the platform has undergone a drastic change under Musk.\nIn August, Musk's X sued a global advertising alliance and several major companies, including Mars and CVS Health, accusing them of unlawfully conspiring to boycott the site and causing it to lose revenue.\nAd revenue at X slumped for months after Musk bought the company in 2022. Some advertisers had been wary of ad spending under Musk amid questions and fears that their brands would appear next to harmful content that would have otherwise been removed under prior owners.\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; editing by Alan Barona)"

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks you should pay attention to.\nA lot has been made of the recent efforts by the United States government to tighten chip exports to China. This coordinated effort, just before Donald Trump takes office, includes stricter license restrictions on US chip firms doing business with China, added scrutiny on those that assemble their hardware in China, and an appeal to allies in Europe and Asia to follow suit. These efforts have only served to further bolster the semiconductor index in China, which leaped to a record high on November 11 amid reports that a recent US order to halt TSM chip supplies to China would accelerate efforts in Beijing to set up advanced chip manufacturing companies in the Asian country.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nChinese brokerage Cinda Securities, in a note published on the China chip situation on November 10, has said that in the medium and long term it will force the reorganization of the supply chain, increase the demand for domestic advanced process production capacity, and promote technological breakthroughs in upstream semiconductor equipment and materials. Many Chinese firms are reliant on TSM chips - 11% of TSM revenue is linked to China - and analysts expect these firms to undergo short-term pain from the US measures, but back them to emerge stronger in the long term due to improvement of domestic chip manufacturing.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered solid Q3 2024 results, depicting the company's overall robust revenue growth, ad performance, and engagement across the core platforms. The total revenue for the quarter increased by 19% year over year (YoY) and reached $40.6 billion.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.\nThis increase was mainly driven by the Family of Apps segment, which greatly contributed to Meta's advertising revenue, comprising Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The third-quarter ad revenues reached $39.9 billion, 19% higher compared to the same period last year, on the back of better-priced ads and higher ad impressions, reflecting Meta's move to monetize the huge users with better ad targeting and AI-powered enhancements.\nThese improved ad-targeting features are courtesy of Meta's investments in AI, which increased ad relevance and boosted engagement. The result of this AI personalization strategy is three times more effective, which means increasing user retention and engagement: an 8% increase on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram. Central to this strategy was Meta AI, the company's AI assistant, which would make sure to really help tailor content and ads to user preferences while creating a more immersive experience across Meta's platforms.\nGeographically, Meta reported strong ad revenue growth in both the Asia-Pacific and European regions, with high user engagement and soaring demand for ad placements. The former enjoys an extensive mobile-first user base that is growing very fast, while the latter has shown great resilience in ad demand against economic challenges. While the U.S. and Canada remain Meta's most profitable markets, growth was relatively slow because of market maturity. This diversified growth across regions underlines Meta's capability to capture new ad revenue streams outside its core North American markets.\nAI Powers Meta's Strong Q3 Growth\nSource: Meta Earnings\nMeta Boosts Profits with Strategic Cost Management and AI Investments Amid Metaverse Ambitions\nAdditionally, Meta's net income for Q3 was 35% YoY higher, a function not only of revenue growth but also increased profitability through operational efficiencies and disciplined cost management. Its margin stretched to 43% from 40% a year ago despite big continuous investments in AI and Reality Labs, Meta's metaverse-focused business segment. An increase in such a margin would say that Meta is arresting non-core costs effectively while reallocating resources to strategic growth areas.\nReality Labs remains at an early stage, though it is considered a critical piece of Meta's longer-term vision of immersive digital experiences. As a result, it continues to incur significant losses. This quarter, Meta spoke about its long-term goal of developing its metaverse and VR/AR capabilities. Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that this technology would change the way digital interactions are conducted over the long term. While Reality Labs posted a significant operating loss, profitability for Meta as a whole was good enough to digest these costs and showcase the resilience of its core business.\nStory Continues\nAccording to marketing expert Dominick Tomanelli, Meta deploys sophisticated AI models by leveraging first-party data and serving up personalized content and targeted ads to drive user experience. Integration of AI tools allows their team to increase user connection through video content creation and recommendation systems with consumers, content creators, and advertisers alike. Another example is investment in AI infrastructure, which should, over time, further underline Meta's commitment to more advanced AI-driven personalization and engagement across all of its platforms.\nMeta's $734 Fair Value: High Growth Potential\nMeta's fair value of $734, according to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, reflects an optimistic view of its future growth potential, especially in AI and Reality Labs. The model assumes Meta will achieve a high 10-year EPS growth rate of 28.80%, driven by anticipated returns on its massive investments in advanced AI and immersive technology through Reality Labs. Following this growth period, the terminal growth rate slows to 4%, representing a mature phase as the company stabilizes. Revenue is projected to grow at an annual rate of 33%, while free cash flow is expected to increase by 25.30% over the next decade. These growth projections underscore confidence that Meta's AI and metaverse initiatives could significantly boost cash flows if they succeed, transforming the company's financial profile and driving earnings upward.\nThe DCF model's outcome$734 per sharesuggests a 22.13% margin of safety compared to the current stock price of $572.04, indicating a potentially undervalued position for Meta based on these assumptions. This valuation implies that, despite high upfront costs and some near-term financial pressures, Meta's long-term growth in new, high-potential areas could justify its current premium pricing. The valuation relies on substantial future growth in earnings, revenue, and cash flow, contingent on Meta's ability to monetize its AI and the metaverse ventures. However, this optimistic fair value comes with inherent risks; if growth falls short of these high expectations, the current stock price might prove overvalued. Investors considering Meta should weigh this potential upside against the risk that ambitious growth goals may not fully materialize.\nCostly AI, Metaverse Investments Amid Mounting Regulatory Risks\nMeta invests in a set of risks, mainly huge capital expenditure and dependency on AI-driven ad revenue. Meta's huge capital expenditure plans are primarily in AI and Reality Labs. Meta increased its guidance for CapEx in 2024 to US$38-40 billion, which might strain cash flow and hurt profitability if these investments do not pay off big. While the focus on AI and metaverse is expected to drive growth for Meta going forward, the near term will likely be a financial burden that presses on the company's margins and free cash flow, particularly because Reality Labs continues to operate at a loss.\nBesides, of course, there are regulatory and geopolitical risks. Meta continues under increasing examination in the U.S. and EU regarding data privacy and AI ethics, where any such regulations would impinge on its use of data and raise compliance costs. Geopolitical tensions, especially in regions like the Asia-Pacific, which have shown phenomenal revenue growth for Meta, can disrupt operations or lead to change policies that hurt advertising demand. While prospects for growth may be bright for Meta in many ways, investors will want to consider these risks carefully in light of today's premium valuation and ambitious but expensive investment initiatives taken by the company.\nTakeaway\nIn all, Meta's Q3 2024 earnings highlight that it can effectively balance short-term profitability with long-term growth initiatives. Solid ad revenue growth driven by AI-driven engagement and responsible cost management set Meta well on its path to achieving its ambitious strategy centered on AI and the metaverse.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

In the two years since the release, technology valuations, which had hit a snag due to broader inflation and slowing growth concerns, have jumped back up. Technology giants have surpassed multi-trillion dollar valuations and OpenAI itself has crossed $150 billion in value. In this environment, technology firms have been pushing for greater capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, telling investors that adding more data and computing power will consistently lead to improved AI models.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nHowever, news agency Reuters reports that new techniques being used by AI firms to train their AI models could reshape the AI arms race, and have implications for the types of resources that AI companies have an insatiable demand for, from energy to types of chips. For example, Ilya Sutskever, a Canadian-Israeli computer scientist who was one of the founders of OpenAI, has said that results from scaling up pre-training have plateaued.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks you missed this week.\nThere is a lot of debate around potential AI policy changes as Donald Trump prepares to take charge as US president. According to a report by news platform Wired, a Trump administration AI policy would likely prioritize ensuring US leadership in AI development, focusing on competition with China. This strategy, per the report, could involve bolstering federal resources to support massive AI projects and maintaining or intensifying sanctions on Chinese tech companies to restrict their access to critical US technology, like advanced chips essential for training powerful AI models. Trump has promised to repeal the executive order on AI by US President Biden, which was introduced to implement safety measures like preventing algorithmic bias and strengthening federal oversight of AI developments. Critics argue that reversing these policies could lead to less oversight in a rapidly evolving field, potentially increasing risks as AI is deployed more broadly.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAnother important development that investors should keep an eye on is the influence of Elon Musk on Trump's policies. Musk aggressively backed Trump during the campaign and his AI startup, xAI, could benefit from friendly Trump policies, per the Wired report.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer was talking about.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the market\u2019s reaction to the election results. He noted that the trading session on November 6 was largely influenced by a collective sigh of relief from traders who were glad the election was over. With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office, many were preparing for the shifts his administration could bring. Cramer pointed out that the market responded positively to Trump\u2019s victory, stating:\n\u201cThe market likes Donald J. Trump and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both and we had a monster-buying celebration. It was a bull jailbreak and the bears never knew what trampled them.\u201d\nCramer reflected on the uncertainty leading up to the election, with many investors fearing a prolonged and contentious process. But with the winner now clear, Cramer argued that the market is better off knowing what lies ahead. He remarked:\n\u201cLet\u2019s understand that many people thought we\u2019d have a contested election, which would cause tremendous uncertainty. The fact that we already know the winner is a huge win for the stock market in itself, which makes it a magnet for new money. This election, with its vicious maelstrom of hate and fear, is finally over.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins and Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch\nOne of Cramer's main focuses was Trump's proposed tax cuts, which he believes will have a substantial impact on corporate profits. Cramer emphasized that the tax cuts are expected to boost earnings, particularly by lowering corporate tax rates, which would directly increase profit estimates and earnings per share. Cramer also highlighted the importance of maintaining low interest rates for these benefits to materialize.\nHe cautioned that while the current environment might feel like a party, there could be risks down the line, especially as debt continues to grow. Despite these concerns, Cramer seemed optimistic, suggesting that the market could continue to rally as long as interest rates stay low and corporate tax cuts come to fruition.\nHowever, Cramer also pointed out a potential complication and commented:\n\u201cWe also have to accept that we will have another earning season right at the time of the inauguration. So we'll have to worry about those earnings too, but not yet.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, Cramer suggested that there could be more significant market moves in the near future, especially if President-elect Trump makes comments about the Federal Reserve that investors find unsettling. He said that such remarks could trigger a negative reaction from the market, potentially leading to a downturn before things settle again.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 16 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 6 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nCramer highlighted the chatter around a conflict between Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) Mark Zuckerberg and President-elect Trump and said:\n\u201cBig Tech got a real boost, especially the ones that have been hectored by antitrust like Alphabet or Amazon or, or frankly even Apple and maybe even, we thought maybe Nvidia and Meta\u2026 I'd also buy Meta here. There's all sorts of bogus scuttlebutt about how the President-elect and Mark Zuckerberg don't get along. I think that's the old days, people. I believe things have gotten better between the two and you should think more about the fundamentals now, which are fabulous\u2026 Look, there's some common ground between the two. It was silly that the stock wasn't up as much, but people were worried about the two of them being angry at each other.\u201d\nMeta (NASDAQ:META), a global leader in digital connectivity has a massive audience of 3.29 billion daily active users across its platforms. It has become a dominant force in shaping how people communicate and share information online.\nAfter the 2016 U.S. elections, Facebook faced criticism for its role in undermining American democracy. Critics argued that the platform's algorithmic News Feed promoted hyperpartisan content, fake news, and disinformation, including materials seeded by Russian operatives. This was later confirmed by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, who declassified a report in January 2017 detailing Russia's interference.\nInitially, its executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, dismissed these concerns, with Zuckerberg even calling it \"pretty crazy\" to suggest that fake news on the platform had influenced the election. However, within 10 months, Zuckerberg acknowledged his earlier comments as dismissive and expressed regret.\nThe company's involvement in the political sphere continued into the 2020 U.S. presidential election. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s critique was included in his \"Save America\" coffee table book, where he threatened legal action against Zuckerberg, stating that if the company engaged in any illegal activity during the 2020 election, Zuckerberg could face lifelong prison time. However, after Trump\u2019s recent victory in the election, Meta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) Zuckerberg publicly congratulated him, expressing optimism for future collaboration with his administration.\nOverall META ranks 13th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\nMarket Capitalization: $3.39 trillion\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide. The company is a key AI player due to its investments in AI technology and integration of AI in its offerings, such as its latest iPhone 16 which comes with new AI features.\nOn November 13, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is about to launch its very own product in the smart home market in an attempt to catch up with its rivals. The product, code-named J490, is an AI Wall Tablet for Home Control, spotlighting the new Apple Intelligence AI platform. The product is designed to be the command center in a home, performing functions such as controlling appliances, handling videoconferencing, and even using artificial intelligence to navigate apps. This new Apple gadget will be competing with Amazon\u2019s Echo Show and Echo Hub smart displays, as well as Google\u2019s Nest Hub.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet.

Offering new tools like Magnetic Mask and the highly anticipated Transcribe to Captions, Final Cut Pro 11 for Mac\u00ae1 also supports the import, edit, and delivery of spatial video projects directly to Apple Vision Pro\u2122.2\nFinal Cut Pro for iPad 2.1 advances the touch-first editing experience with support for Enhance Light and Color; new Live Drawing inks; haptic feedback; even more built-in content, including color-grading presets and dynamic soundtracks; and other meaningful workflow improvements.3 Final Cut Camera 1.1, the intuitive pro recording app for iPhone\u00ae, adds support for 4K120 fps recording on iPhone 16 Pro, the ability to apply a preview lookup table (LUT) while recording, and capture of Log-encoded HEVC video for smaller file sizes.4 And to supercharge songwriting, beat-making, producing, and mixing, Logic Pro for Mac 11.1 and Logic Pro for iPad 2.1 add support for a new Quantec \u2122 Room Simulator plug-in.\nThe new version of Final Cut Pro for Mac and iPad, Final Cut Camera, and Logic Pro for Mac and iPad are available today on the App Store\u00ae.\n\"Our creative apps give artists, producers, directors, and editors around the world the tools they need to express themselves and realize their artistic vision,\" said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple\u2019s senior director of Worldwide Product Marketing for Apps. \"With the power of Apple silicon and state-of-the-art machine learning capabilities, Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro are faster and more intelligent than ever. These latest updates give creative professionals more stylistic interpretations to explore \u2014 whether that\u2019s with fine-tuned masking for color grading or amazing sound processing \u2014 and greater versatility and efficiency in their workflows.\"\nFinal Cut Pro 11\nFinal Cut Pro 11 takes full advantage of Apple\u2019s M-series chips, introducing the powerful and intuitive Magnetic Mask; Transcribe to Captions,5 a highly requested feature that provides fast and accurate closed captions; spatial video editing; and a range of timesaving tools and workflow optimizations.\nAI-Powered Features\nIn Final Cut Pro 11, editors can access two all-new AI-powered tools: Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions. With Magnetic Mask, editors can effortlessly isolate people and objects in a video clip without the need for a green screen or more time-consuming rotoscoping. This powerful and precise automatic analysis provides additional flexibility to customize backgrounds and environments. Editors can also combine Magnetic Mask with color correction and video effects, allowing them to precisely control and stylize each project. And with Transcribe to Captions, closed captions can be automatically generated in the timeline using an Apple-trained large language model that transcribes spoken audio.\nStory Continues\nMagnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions join existing AI-powered features made possible by Apple\u2019s Neural Engine, including:\nSmart Conform to easily make social media-friendly versions of projects in square or vertical formats.\nEnhanced Light and Color to automatically improve the color, color balance, contrast, and brightness of video or still images.\nSmooth Slo-Mo to generate and blend together frames of video \u2014 including footage captured on iPhone 16 Pro in 4K120 fps \u2014 for the highest-quality movement.\nVoice Isolation to enhance speech and optimize sound levels while reducing background noise from audio captured in the field.\nSpatial Video Editing for Apple Vision Pro\nSpatial video allows users to capture life\u2019s precious moments and relive them on Apple Vision Pro. Final Cut Pro 11 now supports spatial video editing, allowing editors to import their footage and add effects,6 make color corrections, and enhance their projects with titles. The depth position of titles and captured footage can also be adjusted during the editing process. Spatial video clips can be captured directly with Vision Pro, or on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, and Canon\u2019s new RF-S7.8mm F4 STM DUAL lens paired with Canon R7.7\nUsers can choose from various viewing modes to preview the left- and right-eye angles on their Mac display. And with Mac Virtual Display\u2122,8 they can bring their edit into Apple Vision Pro, creating an enormous, private, and portable display that\u2019s ideal for complex workflows. Later this year, users will be able to expand Mac Virtual Display to a new panoramic size, creating a massive 32:9 ultrawide curved display that\u2019s equivalent to having two 5K monitors side by side. Spatial videos can be exported directly to a user\u2019s Photos library, viewed immediately on Vision Pro, or shared with others by uploading them to the native visionOS\u2122 Vimeo app.\nTimesaving Features, Blazing Speeds, and Pro Creative Tools\nFinal Cut Pro features advanced editing tools to help streamline creative workflows even further and save time:\nMagnetic Timeline, a trackless approach to editing footage, offers a fluid way to trim and edit a project. Editors can add and rearrange clips seamlessly, making adjustments while keeping video and audio perfectly in sync.\nWith multicam editing, users can instantly sync multiple angles of a project and switch between shots during playback. And new keyboard shortcut options allow users to adjust the view of their timeline and reposition clips.\nOptimizations for Apple silicon allow editors to play back more streams of 4K and 8K ProRes \u00ae video at full quality, add playback effects, and share their work with others at blazing speeds.\nEditors can create a lightweight copy of their library with enhanced proxy tools, decreasing file sizes to make transfer times even shorter.\nUsing Compressor, editors can create custom export settings to deliver their work in a wide range of file formats, and import previous stereoscopic footage to reformat and pair with spatial video footage for an integrated editing experience.\nUsing Motion\u00ae, users can create stunning 2D and 3D titles, generators, and advanced visual effects that are accessible within Final Cut Pro.\nFinal Cut Pro for iPad 2.1\nFinal Cut Pro for iPad 2.1 brings beloved features to the touch-first editing experience. Powered by Apple silicon, Enhance Light and Color is an intelligent way to improve color, color balance, contrast, and brightness in video or still images in one simple step, and is optimized for SDR, HDR, RAW, and Log-encoded media. With haptic feedback for Apple Pencil Pro\u2122 and Magic Keyboard\u00ae, users will feel a light pulse as they trim clips, move media, navigate the timeline, and resize viewer clips to snapping points.\nOther meaningful workflow improvements include a new vertical pinch gesture that can expand or minimize clip height in the timeline; the ability to dynamically adjust the size and position of the viewer in Picture in Picture mode; and timeline support for recordings at 90 fps, 100 fps, and 120 fps on iPhone 16 Pro.\nNew inks for the Live Drawing feature on iPad let users add even more animations to videos with expressive new watercolor, crayon, fountain pen, and monoline pen options. And the content library expands with new modular transitions, color-grading presets, and dynamic soundtracks, along with the ability to easily highlight and overlay visuals with Picture in Picture and Callout effects.\nFinal Cut Camera\nFinal Cut Camera 1.1 brings intuitive pro controls for aspiring and professional directors. The update offers users the ability to capture Log-encoded HEVC video in standalone or Live Multicam sessions, so users can take advantage of the amazing dynamic range of Log while benefitting from reduced file sizes and even more recording time. Final Cut Camera also allows users to enable a LUT preview while recording in Log, showcasing the vibrancy of the original scene in SDR or HDR with the Apple Log LUT. With iPhone 16 Pro, users can record beautiful and crisp 4K120 fps footage for even smoother cinematic slow motion, import it into Final Cut Pro for iPad, and begin their edit. A new advanced level helps users precisely compose shots with roll and tilt indicators, and for top-down shots, Final Cut Camera introduces a crosshairs indicator.\nLogic Pro for Mac 11.1 and Logic Pro for iPad 2.1\nLogic Pro for Mac9 and iPad10 supercharge songwriting, beat-making, producing, and mixing, and are an excellent companion for Final Cut Pro editors. Today, that experience gets even better with the new Quantec Room Simulator plug-in, which allows users to tap into the legendary sound of the most acoustically accurate reverb ever created, built using the original schematics, algorithms, and code from Quantec founder and inventor Wolfgang Buchleitner. Users can select the vintage Quantec QRS to add natural acoustic space to music while preserving sonic character, or the modern Quantec Yardstick for improved clarity and detail. The Quantec QRS technology is a great tool for video editors who want to add natural-sounding spaces to dialog, foley, and music.\n\"The Quantec Room Simulator has been a key element to my sound for many years, appearing on records like Passion and Us. I also used it to build harmonic drones to start my live set, which then evolved into songs like \u2018Across the River,\u2019\" said musician Peter Gabriel. \"It\u2019s wonderful that Apple is bringing the Quantec QRS back to life as a plug-in for Logic users around the world.\"\nWith Reorder Mixer Channels, users can rearrange channel strips by dragging them, and can even select multiple channel strips to reorder them collectively. To make it easier to find and add any plug-in directly using a keyboard command, Logic Pro for Mac users can now search by category, company name, or even part of a plug-in name. Logic Pro for iPad also introduces Sample Folders, giving users access to their personal collection of samples directly from the built-in Sound Browser right from iPad, external storage, and iCloud \u00ae Drive.\nPricing and Availability\nFinal Cut Pro 11 is available today as a free update for existing users and for $299.99 (U.S.) for new users on the Mac App Store.

          "whole_article": "The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.\nThe president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act \u2014 and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech\u2019s future.\nTrump hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He\u2019s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election \u2014 and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn\u2019t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.\nBut Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.\nNow, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump\u2019s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech\u2019s major players.\nAntitrust regulation\nThe Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech\u2019s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business \u201cmore fair.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect\u2019s stop at a McDonald\u2019s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,\u201d explained director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.\nAI legislation\nGenerative AI didn\u2019t take the world by storm until well after Trump\u2019s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.\nFILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nRegulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there\u2019s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.\nThe Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump\u2019s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden\u2019s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.\nHowever, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.\n\u201cWe've seen when that happens,\u201d explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. \u201cWhen that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.\u201d\nTrump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.\nThe CHIPS Act and tariffs\nThe second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.\nBut Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.\n\u201cThe CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,\u201d Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.\nBut during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.\nTariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.\n\u201cHardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,\u201d explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.\n\u201cSo whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.\u201d\nThat could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

In 2022, roughly 60% of U.S. households had some stock exposure and the share of Americans trading stocks directly rose to 21% from 2001.\nBut not everyone who invests in stocks becomes wealthy. Investing requires patience, research and wisdom. Let's look at a success story for inspiration and ideas.\nIn July last year, an investor shared his success story, detailed portfolio and tips on r/Dividends, a discussion board on Reddit with over 600,000 members.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nFrom $25k to $438K Portfolio and $20,000 in Dividends\nThe investor said he started investing at the age of 44 with $25,000. At the time of his post, he was 50 and his portfolio value had reached $438,000.\nBut that's not it. He had about $20,100 in estimated dividend income from his portfolio.\n\"Wish I\u2019d have started when I was 20, I\u2019d be retired now. Remember it's never too late to start so don't give up,\" he said.\nThe investor said his income averaged about $60,000 to $100,000 per year, but his expenses were low, at around $2,000 per month. He said he always managed to \"dump\" extra cash in the stock market.\n\"I sold anything in my home I didn't need and put the money into the portfolio. You'll be surprised what you can sell on FB Marketplace. I also put an ad on Craigslist saying I would take anything for free. I sold some things people gave me for a few hundred $'s and added this to the portfolio.\"\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nHe also shared details on his contributions during the discussion:\n\"Some years I was able to put away up to $35k per year, other years less. I bought index funds and oil stocks at first; my dividends weren't at the forefront because I didn't know any better. Once I had built up a portfolio and interest rates rose, I moved some money from riskier oil stocks to VTI and VUSXX.\"\nStory Continues\nPortfolio Value Doubled Thanks to \u2018Stupid Risks' In Oil Stocks\nBut how did his portfolio go from $25,000 to $438,000? In addition to compounding, the investor's risky bets paid off.\n\"I managed to double my portfolio by taking some stupid risks in oil stocks that happened to work out well.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Virtual Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best virtual reality stocks.\nOverview of the Global VR Market\nVirtual Reality is a computer-generated simulation that allows users to interact with a three-dimensional environment. The four elements that characterize virtual reality and differentiate it from other technologies such as augmented reality and mixed reality are a 3D-simulated environment, immersion, sensory engagement, and realistic interactivity, as revealed by HP.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global virtual reality market size was valued at $25.11 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow from $32.64 billion in 2024 to $244.84 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 28.6% during the forecast period (2024-2032).\nRegion-wise, North America is expected to dominate the global VR market over the forecast period. Another rapidly growing region is Asia Pacific with growth driven by the rising demand for immersive technologies in emerging economies. China, one of the major distributors of head-mounted VR devices and other hardware, is forecasted to have the highest market share in the region. Simultaneously, Europe is the early adopter of virtual solutions in the automotive industry and will be experiencing significant growth, with Germany and the UK as its leading markets.\nHow is Virtual Reality Transforming Today's World?\nThe virtual reality devices used today have their foundation laid on the first head-mounted augmented reality display \"The Sword of Damocles\"\u00a0which was introduced by Ivan Sutherland in 1968. While firms such as Sega and Nintendo developed VR gaming systems in the 1980s and 1990s, it was not until the 2010s that high-quality VR headsets boasting powerful graphics and motion-tracking technology came to the market.\nWhile gaming has been driving the popularity of VR, the potential of the technology has been realized in a multitude of other industries. The American shipping company UPS committed to millions for the advanced training of its drivers, with the firm\u2019s industry-leading training powered by the use of virtual reality in an industrial training environment. Before drivers operate an actual delivery vehicle, the company's Driving Simulator provides realistic driving experiences.\nVirtual reality and augmented reality have also penetrated the healthcare sector as they offer transformative opportunities for medical training, patient care, and therapeutic interventions. The treatment domains in which these technologies are used to treat patients are diverse and include pediatric diagnostics and treatments, pain management, mental health, neurological disorders, surgery planning, intraoperative procedures, telemedicine, as well as post-operative and other rehabilitation therapies. The penetration is evident from the fact that the US FDA has authorized 69 medical devices that incorporate augmented reality and virtual reality.\nStory Continues\nVirtual Reality is also changing the game for the entertainment industry, especially for artists. Fortnite witnessed a record turnout of more than 12 million attendees to its virtual concert featuring the hip-hop superstar Travis Scott in 2020.\u00a0Therefore, VR applications continue to spread around today\u2019s world. The renowned luxury car manufacturer BMW has materialized virtual reality experiences in the automotive space. The company expanded its revolutionary driving experience with BMW M Mixed Reality which tends to blur the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds through state-of-the-art VR/MR technologies.\n25 Most Powerful Brands in the US\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\nOur Methodology\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now, we utilized stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies with the highest market caps. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nThe tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the world in innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. While the firm is well-reputed for multiple smart devices, it made its entry into VR with the launch of its revolutionary Vision Pro headset at its annual WWDC event in June 2023. Apple Vision Pro extends the experience of one\u2019s go\u2011to apps and creates new possibilities in entertainment, productivity, gaming, and more.\nApple Vision Pro marked a major development in the VR world as emphasized by top industry executives. The CEO of Taiwanese tech giant HTC Cher Wang saw Apple\u2019s aforementioned move as a validation for the industry and something that would bring more confidence in the global market for VR. Simultaneously, the chief technology officer of Finnish mixed reality startup Varjo Urho Konttori stated:\n\u201cApple\u2019s entrance into XR with Vision Pro is an important moment for our whole industry\u201d\nRecently, rumors have revealed that the tech giant is working on an affordable version of Vision Pro mixed reality headset. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple has delayed the production of the cheaper Vision Pro to beyond 2027. However, Apple is reportedly working on an updated version of the Vision Pro with an upgraded M5 processor to be launched in 2025.\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended September 28, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported revenue of $94.9 billion, a record September quarter revenue driven by iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach that the sales of the iPhone 15 were stronger than 14 in the year-ago quarter\u00a0and 16 was stronger than 15.\u00a0Additionally, Apple\u2019s active installed base of devices reached a new all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. During the quarter, the firm was excited to announce the all-new iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading VR stock held by 184 hedge funds, as of Q2. The firm has been leading the way in innovation with strong fundamentals and material results.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of\u00a0 best virtual reality stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with EAF.\nIn contrast, Apple, which only shipped 54 million chipsets, saw an 11% revenue increase, making it the top vendor in terms of revenue. This is due to the high profit per device from its proprietary chips used exclusively in iPhones, contributing to its superior margins and market position.\nHowever, Huawei's most remarkable growth has come from this company. Its HiSilicon unit saw a staggering 211% year-over-year increase, though from a smaller base. Huawei shipped just 8 million chipsets, generating $7 billion in sales. This success is notable, given the company's ability to thrive despite significant trade restrictions. Huawei's strong position in the Chinese market and its strategic agility were key to navigating these challenges and driving its growth in the chipset sector.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The company\u2019s anti-union conduct has drawn rebukes from the NLRB. Amazon has recently taken to suing the agency.\nThe NLRB\u2019s Wednesday decision overturned its 1948 ruling in Babcock & Wilcox Co., which permitted mandatory anti-union gatherings. The board said its new prohibition on those meetings will apply prospectively only, to accommodate the reliance that employers may have put on the 76-year-old precedent that it struck down.\nViewpoint-Neutral Ban\nMandatory anti-union gatherings interfere with workers\u2019 organizing rights because they coercively demonstrate employers\u2019 economic power by requiring attendance on pain of discipline or discharge, the NLRB said.\nThe board emphasized that its ruling makes no distinction based on the viewpoint of the speaker\u2014it bars employers from forcing workers to listen to speeches about their organizing rights, whether their bosses urge them to vote for or against a union.\nStory Continues\n\u201cNone of these viewpoints is \u2018offensive\u2019 to the Act,\u201d the NLRB said. \u201cWhat is offensive to the Act, rather, is the employer\u2019s use of its power to require employees to listen to its views\u2014whatever they are.\u201d\nThe now-banned meetings also disrupt organizing rights because they provide a mechanism for companies to observe their workers as they listen to managers address the exercise of organizing rights, the board said. Workers who speak out or ask questions will be noticed by their employers and might fear that they\u2019ve exposed themselves to reprisal, according to the ruling.\nEmployer Safe Harbor\nThe NLRB established a \u201csafe harbor\u201d from liability for employers that want to speak to workers about labor organizing. To take advantage of that protection, companies need to give employees advance notice that they intend to speak about unionization at voluntary meetings, that workers can leave the meetings without adverse consequences, and that attendance won\u2019t be recorded.\nRepublican NLRB member Marvin Kaplan dissented from the ruling, saying the board\u2019s ban on captive-audience speech violates the First Amendment.\n\u201cHere, the conflict between the majority\u2019s prohibition of captive-audience speeches and the Constitution is manifest and irreconcilable,\u201d Kaplan said.\nThe NLRB majority decided against retroactive application of its captive audience ban and didn\u2019t fault Amazon for holding meetings that were lawful at the time.\nBut the board ruled that Amazon committed several other unfair labor practices in its bid to resist unionization, including selectively enforcing a solicitation policy, threatening employees with discipline, and warning workers that it would withhold improvements to wages and working conditions if they vote for the union.\nAmazon intends on appealing, said a company spokesperson who called the decision \u201cwrong on the facts and the law.\u201d\n\u201cMeetings like this are held by many companies because the decision about whether or not to join a union is an important one, and employees deserve to understand the facts so they can make an informed choice,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said in a statement.\nThe case is Amazon.com Services LLC, N.L.R.B., Case 29-CA-280153, 11/13/24.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Robert Iafolla in Washington at riafolla@bloombergindustry.com\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Genevieve Douglas at gdouglas@bloomberglaw.com; Jay-Anne B.

          "whole_article": "By Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com made unlawful promises and threats during mandatory meetings to discourage unionizing at a New York City warehouse, a U.S. labor board said on Wednesday while banning employers from holding such meetings moving forward.\nThe National Labor Relations Board said that so-called \"captive audience meetings,\" which have been legal for decades and are routine during union campaigns, illegally interfere with workers' rights to freely choose whether or not to unionize.\nEmployers can lawfully hold meetings to discuss unionizing if they are voluntary, workers are given advance notice of subjects to be discussed, and no attendance records are kept, said the board, whose members are appointed by the president. The board currently has a majority of Democratic appointees.\nThe NLRB said that Amazon managers solicited grievances and made implied promises to remedy them if workers rejected the union during mandatory meetings at the Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8 ahead of a 2022 union election. At other meetings, managers illegally threatened to withhold raises and benefits if the warehouse unionized, according to the decision.\nAmazon also removed union-related posts on an internet message board and threatened to discipline a JFK8 employee if she re-posted them, the board found. Workers at the warehouse ultimately voted to join the Amazon Labor Union, making it the first and so far only Amazon facility to unionize.\nAmazon and the union did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The board ordered Amazon to post a notice of the violations at the Staten Island warehouse.\nAmazon can appeal the decision to a federal appeals court, which would add to a series of court battles between the e-commerce giant and the labor board.\nAmazon has filed two lawsuits claiming the NLRB's structure is unconstitutional, joining a number of other companies including Elon Musk's SpaceX. Amazon's cases seek to block labor board proceedings against the company, including claims that it has illegally refused to bargain with the union at JFK8.\nThe NLRB's ban on captive audience meetings is likely to face legal challenges by employers, including claims that the ban violates businesses' free-speech rights.\nThe decision could also be overturned by the board when it gains a Republican majority, as the agency often reverses itself after changes in leadership. President-elect Donald Trump could have a Republican-led board in place as soon as next year.\nAt least 10 U.S. states including New York, California, and most recently Alaska have banned captive audience meetings or prohibited employers from disciplining workers who do not attend them.\nStory Continues\nThe NLRB said its decision would only be applied moving forward and not to pending cases.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Chizu Nomiyama)\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.\nThe president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act \u2014 and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech\u2019s future.\nTrump hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He\u2019s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election \u2014 and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn\u2019t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.\nBut Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.\nNow, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump\u2019s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech\u2019s major players.\nAntitrust regulation\nThe Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech\u2019s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business \u201cmore fair.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect\u2019s stop at a McDonald\u2019s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,\u201d explained director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.\nAI legislation\nGenerative AI didn\u2019t take the world by storm until well after Trump\u2019s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.\nFILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nRegulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there\u2019s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.\nThe Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump\u2019s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden\u2019s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.\nHowever, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.\n\u201cWe've seen when that happens,\u201d explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. \u201cWhen that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.\u201d\nTrump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.\nThe CHIPS Act and tariffs\nThe second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.\nBut Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.\n\u201cThe CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,\u201d Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.\nBut during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.\nTariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.\n\u201cHardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,\u201d explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.\n\u201cSo whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.\u201d\nThat could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN)has launched a low-cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced at under $20, an effort to compete with discount retailers that have increasingly encroached on the e-commerce giant's turf.\nIn a blog post on Wednesday, the company said the new Amazon Haul storefront will mostly feature products that cost less than $10 and offer free delivery on orders over $25. Amazon plans to ship the products to U.S. customers from a warehouse it operates in China, according to documentation the company provided to sellers. Amazon said Haul orders could arrive within one to two weeks.\nMany of the available products on the storefront Wednesday resembled the types of items typically found on Shein and Temu, the China-founded e-commerce platforms that have grown in popularity in recent years.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nShein\u2019s core customers are young women enticed by the low-cost apparel sold on the site. Temu offers clothing, accessories, kitchen gadgets and a broad array of other products for bargain-hungry shoppers.\nTemu and Shein often get criticism over the environmental impact of the ultra-fast fashion business model the two companies follow. They have also faced scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and abroad over other issues, including some of the products on their platforms.\nAmazon\u2019s new storefront, which is only available on its shopping app and mobile website, features unbranded products, such a phone case and a hairbrush that cost $2.99, and a sleeveless dress that retails for $14.99. The company is seeking to drive home its message on value, with banners on its page advertising \u201ccrazy low prices\u201d and activewear \u201cthat won\u2019t stretch your budget.\u201d\n\u201cFinding great products at very low prices is important to customers, and we continue to explore ways that we can work with our selling partners so they can offer products at ultra-low prices,\u201d Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Selling Partner Services, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s early days for this experience, and we\u2019ll continue to listen to customers as we refine and expand it in the weeks and months to come.\u201d\nTo be sure, importing goods out of China could soon become more expensive for Amazon. In September, the Biden administration said it was cracking down on cheap products sold out of China, a move designed to reduce U.S. dependence on Beijing but could also trigger higher prices for the U.S. consumers who have flocked to Shein and Temu. President-elect Donald Trump has also proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China.\nStory Continues\nAmazon announced other news this week.\nThe company said it was shutting down its free, ad-supported streaming service Freevee and consolidating the content under Prime Video, which now also features ads for Prime members who refuse to pay extra to avoid them.\nThe Seattle-based tech company confirmed Wednesday that it will phase out Freevee in the coming weeks, a move that it says is intended to \u201cdeliver a simpler viewing experience for customers.\u201d All Freevee content that\u2019s currently streaming on Prime Video will be labeled \u201cWatch for Free\u201d so both Prime and non-Prime members can easily see what\u2019s available for free, the company said.\n\u201cThere will be no change to the content available for Prime members, and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is making it harder for disabled employees to get permission to work from home, underscoring the tech giant\u2019s determination to get its corporate workforce back to the office five days a week.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThe Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions\nArizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump\nThe company recently told employees with disabilities that it was implementing a more rigorous vetting process, both for new requests to work from home and applications to extend existing arrangements. Affected workers must submit to a \u201cmultilevel leader review\u201d and could be required to return to the office for monthlong trials to determine if accommodations meet their needs.\nThe revised disability policy \u2014 which hasn\u2019t previously been reported \u2014 is roiling a workforce already alienated by a five-day return-to-office mandate that\u2019s scheduled to begin in January.\nChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy says the return-to-office requirement will strengthen the company\u2019s culture, which he believes has suffered since the pandemic and become overly bureaucratic. But the policy made Amazon a tech industry outlier and is seen by some employees as a way to get people to quit and shrink the workforce.\nAmazon has denied having an ulterior motive and says the new disability policy reflects its broader return-to-office philosophy.\n\u201cWe understand that this is going to be a transition and we\u2019re working with our employees to make it as easy as possible,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant. When in-person accommodations are needed, we\u2019ll provide them, and in some cases, offer an exception to working from the office.\u201d She declined to say how many requests have been approved.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to make \u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d including service animals, reserved parking spaces and closed-captioned meetings, to help disabled employees do their jobs. But there are no hard and fast rules guaranteeing such workers the right to work remotely, giving Amazon leverage to call them back to offices even if they\u2019ve been working successfully from home.\nAffected employees are receiving calls from \u201caccommodation consultants\u201d who explain how the new policy works. They review medical documentation and discuss how effective working from home has been for employees who\u2019ve already received an accommodation as well as any previous attempts to help the person work in the office. If the consultant agrees that the person should be allowed to work from home, another Amazon manager must sign off. If they don\u2019t, the request goes to a third manager.\nStory Continues\nDuring a conversation with an employee suffering from a stress disorder, according to a person familiar with the exchange, an accommodation consultant attempted to establish rapport but also asked the person about sensitive medical issues, such as how the person navigates life outside work and how long it takes them to regulate emotions during a panic attack.\nSpokesperson Callahan said finding effective work accommodations might entail asking employees questions to understand how they navigate their disabilities outside work.\nOne employee, who requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from Amazon, said the process is so convoluted that weeks have passed since applying for a disability exception. The employee\u2019s doctor wrote a letter detailing why the worker should be allowed to work from home, and the disability team requested further documentation. The worker described answering a question only to be asked it again by someone else.\nCallahan said if a case is complex, it may require clarification questions and take more time to finalize than others.\nSome workers fear the process was designed to make requests less likely to be approved, two employees said. In internal chat rooms, according to one of them, employees have accused Jassy of hypocrisy because the bureaucratic process belies his stated determination to cut through red tape that he says is slowing Amazon down.\nIn 2023, after the rise of remote work, 22.5% of people with disabilities were employed, the highest percentage since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the metric in 2008. Working from home can benefit people with a range of disabilities, including chronic allergies, limited mobility and anxiety disorders.\nSome advocates for the disabled fret that Amazon\u2019s position as the country\u2019s second-largest private employer could influence other companies and erode pandemic-era gains for disabled workers. \u201cIt sets a dangerous precedent with other employers,\u201d said Ariel Simms, president and CEO of Disability Belongs, an advocacy group. \u201cSome employees just leave their jobs if the accommodation process is too difficult to navigate.\u201d\nWorkers denied permission to work remotely can file discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that investigates discrimination claims in the workplace. That would put the burden on Amazon to prove that being in the office is an essential part of a job, said Kenneth Shiotani, a senior staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big gray area. How essential is the in-person aspect of the job,\u201d Shiotani said. \u201cThere are clearly jobs where being there in person is an essential function. It is much harder to prove in an office, white-collar job since electronic communication is pretty effective.\u201d\n(Updates with further company comment.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nA Guide to Trump\u2019s Tariff Plans: Expect High Drama and a Bumpy Rollout\nNorth Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\nOh, the Irony.

From there, the company plans to get an early start on Cyber Monday, as it will immediately begin offering deals under that banner, which will run through Dec. 2.\nThe holiday creep has been going on for quite some time, but it\u2019s a bit more understandable this year from a retail perspective.

Stores are offering their deep discounts especially early this year to maximize their holiday revenues, which are the most important of the year.\nWhile many of the deals won\u2019t be unveiled until the sale begins, Amazon did offer a few early discounts, as it often does before a big sales event. Included among those were:\nApple AirPods Pro 2 - $190 (orig. $249)\nDyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum Cleaner, $400 (orig. $570)\nYankee Candle Balsam & Cedar Large Jar Candle, $17 (orig. $31)\nAmazon\u2019s also jumping into the Thanksgiving meal deal price wars, offering turkey, side dishes and desserts for six guests at a cost of less than $5 per person.\n\"The holidays are a time to gather with loved ones, make memories, and create traditions,\" said Carmen Nestares Pleguezuelo, vice president of North America Marketing & Prime Tech at Amazon, in a statement. \"At Amazon, we want to make holiday shopping as convenient and easy as possible.\u201d\nAmong the deals Amazon will offer during the back-to-back sales are:\nBlack Friday deals\n55% off select Amazon devices, including Ring cameras, Fire TVs and Echo devices.\n50% off selected toys from Disney, Marvel and Star Wars\n50% off select headphones and earbuds from Beats\nCyber Monday deals\n55% off select mattresses from Zinus\n50% off Play-doh, Hasbro games and Nerf\n45% off Le Creuset and Saub cookware\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

STRL, Leidos Holdings, Inc. LDOS, Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.\nWhy Interest Coverage Ratio?\nThe interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.\n\nDebt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company\u2019s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.\n\nInterest coverage ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.\n\nAn interest coverage ratio lower than 1 suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company\u2019s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.\nThe Winning Strategy\nApart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.\n\nInterest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry Median\n\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\n\n5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks with a strong EPS growth history.\n\nProjected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.\n\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\n\nVGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.\n\nHere are four of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nSterling Infrastructure, which is engaged in e-infrastructure, transportation and building solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B.

The initiative is spearheaded by Annapurna Labs, a chip start-up acquired by Amazon in 2015 for $350 million.

          "whole_article": "Disney DIS\u00a0is a stock Wall Street will be watching closely this week with the media conglomerate set to release results for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday, November 14.\nWith Disney shares up a respectable +13% year to date, investors may be wondering if there is more upside ahead as earnings approach.\nDisney\u2019s Q4 Expectations\nDisney\u2019s Q4 sales are expected at $22.59 billion, a 6% increase from $21.24 billion in the comparative quarter. More intriguing, Disney\u2019s cost-saving initiatives appear to be working with Q4 earnings projected to increase 33% to $1.09 per share versus EPS of $0.82 a year ago.\nExceeding earnings expectations for seven consecutive quarters, Disney has posted an impressive average EPS surprise of 18.01% in its last four quarterly reports. Disney has exceeded top line estimates in two of the last four quarters with an average sales surprise of 1.05%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDisney\u2019s Streaming Memberships\nReductions to its workforce and reduced operating costs among its streaming segments have been the main catalyst for Disney's increased probability.\nEPSN+ subscribers are expected at 25.73 million with Disney+ users forecasted at 120 million. However, Disney+ subscribers would reflect a noticeable dip from the 150 million paid members in the same period last year. Still, when including Hulu subscribers which are projected at 51 million, Disney is edging toward 200 million total streaming memberships.\nThis is second to streaming leader Netflix NFLX\u00a0who recently reported over 280 million paid memberships in October.\nMonitoring Disney\u2019s Valuation\nAt around $102, Disney\u2019s stock trades at 19.2X forward earnings which is a nice discount to the S&P 500\u2019s 25.3X and Netflix\u2019s 41.4X.\nFurthermore, DIS trades at the optimum level of less than 2X sales compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 5.4X and Netflix\u2019s 9X.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTakeaway\nDisney's Q4 results will be crucial to reconfirming the company\u2019s return to growth as its stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That said, long-term investors could certainly be rewarded given Disney\u2019s appealing valuation with the Average Zacks Price Target of $114.92 a share suggesting 14% upside for DIS.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Cable news took a major ratings hit on election night, a stark reminder of an industry struggling amid a mass shift towards streaming and alternative media.\n\u201cThere isn't a media executive that doesn't know that there's a problem. There isn't a media executive that isn't actively working on that problem,\u201d former CNN CEO Chris Licht told me at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe facts are that people have lost trust in legacy media,\u201d Licht added. The media veteran was the head honcho at CNN from May 2022 to June 2023.\nHow to fix the issue is the multibillion-dollar question facing the nation\u2019s most powerful news executives, as growing distrust is one of several factors contributing to the industry\u2019s steady ratings decline.\nNielsen data showed TV viewership of the presidential election coverage fell by a quarter from four years ago, with the three largest cable news networks \u2014 CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News \u2014 all reporting a drop from 2020.\nFormer CNN CEO Chris Licht (left) with Yahoo Finance anchor Seana Smith (right) at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Nov. 12, 2024.\nRecent executive commentary and Q3 results have further highlighted the massive challenges in the industry. Paramount (PARA) reported continued declines in its linear TV business in the third quarter, while Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) saw a 3% year-over-year decline in revenue, fueled in part by cord cutting.\nThe decreasing viewership has prompted media giants to rethink the strategy surrounding their linear networks.\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Licht\u2019s former boss, said on his company\u2019s earnings call last week that he\u2019s exploring \"all things operationally and strategically\" to ensure shareholder value.\nOne of the options long speculated by Wall Street: a potential spinoff. Recent analysis from Bank of America explored a possible split of WBD\u2019s streaming and studio businesses from its traditional linear TV division.\nRead what top decision-makers are saying at Yahoo Finance's Invest event:\nFormer CNN CEO Chris Licht: Viewers have 'lost trust' in legacy media\nCrypto surge partially reflects less trust in government: Economist Judy Shelton\nAnheuser-Busch InBev CEO: Bud Light sales are stable\nAnd WBD is far from the only legacy media business that could be headed for a split. Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst Geetha Ranganathan recently told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief that \u201cwe can expect to see more consolidation\u201d across the industry.\n\u201cIf there's any sector that is in need of consolidation, it really is the media sector,\u201d Ranganathan said. \u201cThere are just so many headwinds right now that are affecting the sector, especially as consumers are migrating in droves away from the linear TV model to the streaming model.\u201d\n\u2022 USD\n(PARA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nDespite the increase in cord-cutting and the seemingly inevitable consolidation wave, Licht still believes the cable industry will survive. The networks that adapt successfully won't only see a boost to their bottom lines, but will significantly help society, he said.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIt will absolutely decline \u2026 but I think there's a floor. I don't think that one day you're going to wake up and there are zero cable subscriptions,\u201d Licht said.\n\u201cCan legacy media reinvent itself in a way that then can reconnect with people and become relevant in their lives again and become trusted?

But one standout stock has more than doubled the market - over the past five years, Netflix has surged 191% to $822.90 per share. The party hasn\u2019t stopped as it\u2019s also gained 33.5% in the last six months, beating the market by 19.1%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the performance may have investors wondering how to approach the situation.\nIs NFLX\u2019s stock a buy right now? Or is the market overestimating its value?\nFind out in our full research report, it's free.\nTwo Reasons We Like Netflix\nLaunched by Reed Hastings as a DVD mail rental company until its famous pivot to streaming in 2007, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is a pioneering streaming content platform.\n1. EBITDA Margin Reveals a Well-Run Organization\nInvestors frequently analyze operating income to understand a business\u2019s core profitability. Similar to operating income, EBITDA is the most common profitability metric for consumer internet companies because it removes various one-time or non-cash expenses, offering a more normalized view of profit potential.\nNetflix has been a well-oiled machine over the last two years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a consumer internet business, boasting an average EBITDA margin of 24.2%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it\u2019s a show of well-managed operations if they\u2019re high when gross margins are low.\nNetflix EBITDA Margin\n2. Free Cash Flow Margin Increased, Juicing Financials\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Netflix\u2019s margin expanded by 18.4 percentage points over the last three years. This is encouraging because its free cash flow profitability rose more than its operating profitability, suggesting it\u2019s becoming a less capital-intensive business. Its free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 19%.\nNetflix Free Cash Flow Margin\nOne Reason To Stay Cautious:\u00a0Customer Spending Decreases\u2026 Engagement Falling?\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Netflix because it measures how much the average user spends. ARPU is also a key indicator of how valuable its users are (and can be over time).\nStory Continues\nNetflix\u2019s ARPU fell over the last two years, averaging 1.4% annual declines. This isn\u2019t great, but the increase in global streaming paid memberships is more relevant for assessing long-term business potential. We\u2019ll monitor the situation closely; if Netflix tries boosting ARPU by taking a more aggressive approach to monetization, it\u2019s unclear whether users can continue growing at the current pace.\nNetflix ARPU\nFinal Judgment\nThere are definitely things to like about Netflix, and with its shares topping the market in recent months, the stock trades at 29x forward EV-to-EBITDA, or $822.90 per share. Is now a good time to buy?\nSee our in-depth research report, it's free.\nStocks We Like More Than Netflix\nNow, with the elections behind us, rates dropping and inflation cooling off, many analysts are expecting a breakout market to the end of the year \u2014 and we\u2019re zeroing in on the stocks that could benefit immensely.\nTake advantage of the rebound by checking out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include including The Walt Disney Company DIS, Amazon AMZN, Netflix NFLX and Comcast CMCSA.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nTo Buy Or Not To Buy: Disney Ahead of Q4 Earnings\nThe Walt Disney Company is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Nov. 14.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $22.59 billion, suggesting modest growth of 6.37% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\nThe consensus mark for earnings has moved south by a penny to $1.09 per share over the past 30 days, indicating growth of 32.93% year over year.\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nIn the last reported quarter, Disney delivered an earnings surprise of 15.83%. The company\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.01%.\nThe Walt Disney Company price-eps-surprise | The Walt Disney Company Quote\nEarnings Whispers\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Disney this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\nDIS has an Earnings ESP of -1.63% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nFactors Shaping Upcoming Results\nAs the media landscape shifts from traditional linear TV to streaming, Disney finds itself in an enviable position. With two robust U.S. streaming services, Disney+ and Hulu, complemented by ESPN+, the entertainment giant is well-equipped to navigate this transition seamlessly.\nOne of Disney's key advantages is its bundling strategy, which combines these streaming services into a compelling package. This approach is not only expected to have boosted average revenue per account in the to-be-reported quarter but is also likely to have helped reduce customer churn.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, Disney expects Disney+ Core subscribers to grow modestly. The company remains optimistic projecting profitability of the combined streaming businesses to improve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, with both Entertainment DTC and ESPN+ expected to be profitable in the quarter.\nStory Continues\nHowever, DIS is likely to have suffered from a persistent decline in Linear TV revenues, which is expected to have negatively impacted Media and Entertainment Distribution revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.\nOur model estimates for Entertainment revenues (which include Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing and Other Revenue) are pegged at $9.44 billion, indicating a decrease of 0.8% year over year.\nDIS\u2019 true strength lies in its unparalleled portfolio of Intellectual Property (IP). From the iconic Marvel and Star Wars franchises to the beloved Disney princesses, Mickey Mouse and Pixar's timeless classics, the company owns the most powerful collection of IPs in the media industry. This wealth of IP is a significant asset, as it gives audiences an immediate connection to the content, reducing the risk associated with content investments.\nThe company's extensive library of IP not only fuels its studio operations but also underpins its entire business ecosystem, including streaming, linear networks and the profitable Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products segment.\nIn the Experiences segment, DIS expects that the demand moderation it saw in domestic businesses in the fiscal third quarter could impact the next few quarters. While the company is actively monitoring attendance and guest spending and aggressively managing the cost base, Disney expects the Experiences segment\u2019s operating income to decline by mid-single digits compared with the prior year, reflecting these underlying dynamics as well as impacts at Disneyland Paris from a reduction in normal consumer travel due to the Olympics and some cyclical softening in China.\nAs we discuss the quarter under review, investors should pay close attention to key metrics, such as park attendance, per-capita spending and any announcements regarding expansion plans, particularly in international markets. The performance of this segment might have provided a strong foundation for Disney's overall growth trajectory.\nOur model estimate for the Experiences segment (renamed from Disney Parks, Experiences and Products) revenues is $9.13 billion, indicating 12% growth year over year.\nDespite experiencing strong demand at Disney Cruise Line in the quarter under review, results in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to reflect pre-launch expenses for Disney Adventure and Disney Treasure.\nPrice Performance & Valuation\nShares of DIS have returned 11.7% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector\u2019s growth of 10%. Disney operates in a fiercely competitive streaming market dominated by the likes of Amazon-owned Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, as well as the growing prominence of services from Apple, Comcast -owned Peacock and HBO Max.\nValuation-wise, Disney is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 19.53X compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry\u2019s 19.11X, reflecting a stretched valuation. The company\u2019s debt balance of $47.5 billion compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and its current marketable investment securities balance of $5.95 billion.\nInvestment Considerations: Balancing Risk and Reward\nDisney remains a prominent name in the investment world, long revered as a blue-chip stock and a staple in many portfolios. DIS' strength lies in its globally recognized brand and diverse intellectual properties spanning movies, TV shows, theme parks and merchandise. This diverse portfolio has historically given Disney a unique edge in captivating audiences worldwide and generating consistent revenue streams.\nHowever, recent years have brought significant challenges, including disruptions in traditional media, pandemic impacts on theme parks and evolving consumer behaviors. These headwinds have prompted investors to reevaluate Disney's appeal, questioning whether the Magic Kingdom can maintain its former allure in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing entertainment landscape.\nFinal Thought\nDisney remains a diversified media and entertainment powerhouse with a strong brand and valuable intellectual property. Its theme parks and resorts continue to be a significant revenue driver, and the potential for growth in emerging markets of Asia remains promising. However, the accelerating trend of cord-cutting continues to put pressure on this segment, potentially offsetting gains in other areas.\nFor those considering how to play Disney stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, a nuanced approach may be warranted. Investors with a shorter investment horizon may want to exercise caution and wait for a better entry point, given the uncertainties surrounding the company's growth prospects and the competitive pressure it faces despite the enduring power of the Disney brand.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Over 50% of new Netflix sign-ups are for the advertising-supported plan, the company said.\nNetflix launched its ad-supported tier in November of 2022 to counter slowing subscriber numbers. It not only worked then; it's continued to work, and Netfllix says it continues \u201cto see positive momentum and growth across all areas of the business.\u201d\nAdvertisers are following those crowds. Netflix said both of the two live Christmas Day NFL games it will air in December have sold out of all available in-game inventory. And upcoming anticipated series, like Squid Game 2, have lured new partners as well.\nThat could set the company up for even more growth in 2025, when it will begin airing WWE\u2019s flagship Raw program on Mondays. Raw is consistently one of the top-rated programs on cable today and many of those advertisers could follow the brand to Netflix.\nNetflix self-reports viewership, but said it has partnered with Nielsen for live ratings of the Christmas Day games. It\u2019s unclear if the two companies will work together on upcoming live programming.\nTo put the 70-million figure into perspective, Apple TV Plus has a total membership estimated at just 25 million. Peacock stands at 34 million and Hulu has 51.1 million members.\nNetflix, all totaled, has over 282.7 million subscribers around the world.

In the U.S., Netflix with ads costs $6.99 a month, compared with ad-free options that start at $15.49 a month.\nAt first, Netflix\u2019s ad-supported tier was powered by Microsoft\u2019s technology through a partnership, but the streamer is transitioning to using its own in-house ad technology, which will make it function independently from third parties.\nThe ad-supported tier was part of a broader push to diversify Netflix's offerings and boost revenue. In addition to commercials, Netflix has started streaming live events, cracking down on password-sharing and promoting games on its platform.\nThis week, Netflix will up its live sports ambitions with a boxing match between former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and influencer-turned-fighter Jake Paul.\nNetflix in the third quarter added 5 million subscribers, bringing its total to about 283 million globally.\nRead more: From Chris Rock to the SAG Awards.

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this internet video service have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has gained 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 points to a change of +64.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.5%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) are fighting two Supreme Court cases this year that they claim will flood the legal system with investor lawsuits if not decided in their favor.\nSo far, things aren't exactly going their way.\nNvidia\u2019s lawyers made their case before the high court on Wednesday and drew skepticism from justices across the ideological spectrum. The same happened to Meta\u2019s lawyers last week.\n\u201cIt just seems to me that you're asking us to engage in a kind of analysis that we are not very good at,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan, an appointee by Democratic President Barack Obama, told Nvidia\u2019s lawyer Neal Kumar Katyal.\nThe outcome of the cases could undermine or embolden future securities fraud litigants.\nNvidia argues that investors who sued the company alleging that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made false statements should be required to present more particular information in their lawsuit about what Huang knew at the time of his statements.\nThe investors claim that in 2017 and 2018, Huang knowingly departed from Nvidia\u2019s internal company data by misattributing the company\u2019s demand for chips to the video gaming market.\nJensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia, (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDemand at the time, the investors hypothesized, was actually driven by the more volatile market of cryptocurrency mining. That hypothesis relied on the opinion of a financial analyst who based his conclusion on publicly available documents, rather than Nvidia\u2019s company documents.\n\u201cThis is a highly technical subject, and I just don't understand how a court is opposed to be evaluating that at the pleading stage,\u201d Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, told Nvidia\u2019s lawyer.\nThe justices pressed Nvidia to explain why they should reverse a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, repeating a point they made in the case against Meta's Facebook argued last week.\nIn both cases, the appellate court allowed investors to proceed against the companies with proposed class-action securities fraud suits.\nYale Law School professor Jonathan Macey said he was surprised by the justices\u2019 questions in the Facebook case.\n\u201cOne thing that was amazing in the oral argument,\u201d he said, \u201cis you've got this kind of across-the-aisle alliance\u201d with conservative Justice Clarence Thomas to liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressing concerns that were \u201cvery pro-plaintiff.\u201d\nFacebook, for its part, said investors should not be able to allege that it misled its stockholders by omitting that its partnership with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users.\nStory Continues\nAt the core of both disputes are questions about what facts a plaintiff must include in a legal complaint to keep a case in court.\nFacebook argued that its disclosures were not false or misleading by failing to disclose that the Cambridge Analytica breach actually materialized in the past, especially because the so-called risk posed no known risk of ongoing or future business harm.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill in 2018.. (Photo by Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) \u00b7 Anadolu via Getty Images\nAccording to Nvidia, investors should not be able to maintain a proposed class-action lawsuit against the company by relying on an expert\u2019s opinion.\n\u201cCongress \u2026 wanted to stop lawsuits like this, lawsuits that allowed for fraud by hindsight,\u201d Katyal said on behalf of Nvidia during Wednesday\u2019s arguments.\n\u201cWhen a stock drops, all [plaintiffs] have to do is find an expert with numbers that contradict a company's public statements,\u201d Katyal said.\nKatyal went on to say that a decision in favor of the shareholders created \u201can easy road map\u201d for plaintiffs to evade a federal law that requires particular information to be included in a securities fraud complaint.\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), which was in part created to prevent frivolous lawsuits, states that a plaintiff must show that a defendant company intended to make a false or misleading statement and that the statement was, in fact, false.\nSupreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, also entertained the idea that the PSLRA may need refining.\nGorsuch said \u201cit beggars belief\u201d to think that a CEO, such as Huang, would have been unaware of the source of such a large portion of the company's income.\nJim Redwood, a securities law professor with Albany Law, doubted that Supreme Court would ultimately rule in favor of the investors, saying he expects both cases to be resolved in a manner that curbs future securities class action lawsuits.\n\u201cThe Facebook case is somewhat closer,\u201d he said, explaining that the social media company\u2019s case may be somewhat weaker than Nvidia\u2019s.\nThe Justice Department joined in the Nvidia case, siding with investors.\n\u201cWe think that the 9th Circuit correctly applied the standard here,\u201d the DOJ\u2019s lawyer said during arguments on Wednesday.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Bitcoin started the year on a high, extending its gains from 2023. However, the rally came to a halt in the second quarter. Market experts had predicted that the cryptocurrency still has much potential and the rally would resume in the second half of the year.\nThe recent rally is being fueled by Donald Trump\u2019s landmark victory in the Presidential election coupled with another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve last week. Given this situation, investing in Bitcoin-centric stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, BlackRock, Inc.\u00a0BLK and Accenture plc ACN, which have strong growth potential for the near term, would be a prudent choice.\nBitcoin Rallies Past $90,000\nLast week, Bitcoin surpassed $75,000 for the first time, hours after the nation went to polls to elect the 47th President. The cryptocurrency has not looked back since then. Bitcoin had earlier hit an all-time high of $73,770 in March but suffered over the next three months.\nHowever, it staged a rebound in mid-September after the Federal Reserve announced a 50-basis point interest rate cut, ending its monetary tightening campaign in its bid to curb the 40-year-high inflation.\nThe rally was further fueled last week following Trump\u2019s victory in the election that saw Bitcoin hitting a fresh high. Earlier this week, Bitcoin surpassed $80,000 for the first time and on Tuesday, it hit a new milestone of $90,000, gaining 34% since Trump\u2019s win. The cryptocurrency was last trading at $87250 and is on track to surpass $100,000 in the near term.\nTrump promised during his campaign to make the United States a leader in the digital asset sector, which would involve building a strategic Bitcoin reserve and selecting regulators who are enthusiastic about digital assets. The positive sentiment is now boosting Bitcoin. Also, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last week, its second straight interest rate cut in three months, which bodes well for the crypto market.\nCrypto Stocks With Upside\nNVIDIA Corporation\nNVIDIA Corporation is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%.

The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.\nNvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\nThat chipmaking dominance has cemented Nvidia\u2019s place as the poster child of the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 what CEO Jensen Huang has dubbed \u201cthe next industrial revolution.\u201d Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips over the last year.\nNvidia is among the most valuable companies in the S&P 500, worth over $3 trillion. The company is set to report its third quarter earnings next week.\nIn the Supreme Court case, the company is arguing that the investors' lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints.\nA district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration is backing the investors.\nStory Continues\nA decision is expected by early summer.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles contributed to this report\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nThe meteoric rise of tech stocks like Nvidia has made many investors incredibly rich. They are examples of companies whose values have skyrocketed because they make products that support AI, but if you missed out on them, this sector is full of other potential big winners. One is Penguin Solutions, which is coming off a disappointing Q3 2024. So, why are so many analysts bullish on it?\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nOne of the most pressing questions facing the tech industry is how to expand and maximize AI\u2019s capabilities. That's why data center REITs and utility stocks are so hot. AI consumes data and power at geometric rates. However, it also depends on memory and storage. Penguin Solutions (Nasdaq: PENG) provides a full range of products and services that help data centers and tech companies satisfy AI's intense memory requirements.\nA partial list of Penguin\u2019s products includes solid-state servers, LED applications and build-to-suit solutions for data centers. Penguin was originally formed in 1988 under the name SMART Global Holdings. In the 36 years since it was founded, Penguin has become a trusted service provider for multiple sectors, including:\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Telecommunications\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Health care\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Energy sector\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Government and education\nTrending: During market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses.\nDespite that strong client base, Penguin\u2019s stock has been down about 10% this year and the company just released a less-than-stellar Q4 2024 earnings report. The company's earnings per share (EPS) of $0.37 bested the $0.35 of Q3 2023 but fell short of the $0.40 EPS analysts predicted. Net sales of $1.2 billion were also less than 2023's $1.4 billion. This led to a sell-off in late October and Penguin is now trading at $17.29.\nThat's a relatively low buy-in for a 30-plus-year-old company that provides AI and tech solutions to clients in multiple sectors. Analysts at Goldman agree and recently gave Penguin a \"buy\" rating. Goldman believes that Penguin's roster of products and services, plus its low share price, adds up to an undervalued stock. Their forecast for Penguin stock is $21, but Stifel analysts think Penguin shares can hit $27.\nStory Continues\nSee Also: Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.\nThere also seems to be a consensus between Penguin's management and its analysts regarding a revenue rebound in 2025. Penguin management predicts revenue will increase by 15% and analysts expect revenue to match the $1.4 billion of 2023. If Penguin hits those targets, the share price is set for a strong increase. If shares reach the halfway point between the $21 and $27 analysts predict, Penguin investors will have a happy 2025.\nThat would see Penguin shares trading around $24, a near 35% gain on the current $17.29 share price. It's important to remember that there is no guarantee that Penguin will hit the targets set by analysts. However, it's also possible that Penguin will exceed those expectations and become a big winner in 2025. So, if you're looking for an affordable tech stock and missed out on Nvidia, give Penguin a look.\nYou Can Profit From Real Estate Without Being A Landlord\nReal estate is a great way to diversify your portfolio and earn high returns, but it can also be a big hassle.

This coordinated effort, just before Donald Trump takes office, includes stricter license restrictions on US chip firms doing business with China, added scrutiny on those that assemble their hardware in China, and an appeal to allies in Europe and Asia to follow suit. These efforts have only served to further bolster the semiconductor index in China, which leaped to a record high on November 11 amid reports that a recent US order to halt TSM chip supplies to China would accelerate efforts in Beijing to set up advanced chip manufacturing companies in the Asian country.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nChinese brokerage Cinda Securities, in a note published on the China chip situation on November 10, has said that in the medium and long term it will force the reorganization of the supply chain, increase the demand for domestic advanced process production capacity, and promote technological breakthroughs in upstream semiconductor equipment and materials. Many Chinese firms are reliant on TSM chips - 11% of TSM revenue is linked to China - and analysts expect these firms to undergo short-term pain from the US measures, but back them to emerge stronger in the long term due to improvement of domestic chip manufacturing.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

On November 11, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar raised the price target on Nvidia to $175 from $140 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The advisory also elevated Nvidia to its top large-cap pick given the company's dominant positioning in artificial intelligence accelerators and the upcoming launch of the Blackwell architecture. The total addressable market for AI accelerators will continue to rise in 2025 by $70 billion, and Nvidia is well positioned to capture most of the incremental market increase while ceding only a small bit to its merchant chip competitors, Kumar told investors in a research note. On Nvidia's Q3 report, Piper's bull case projected a beat of roughly $1.3 billion in revenue for the October quarter and a beat of around $1.5 billion in a greatly supply-constrained January quarter.\nStory Continues\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you should pay attention to.

          "whole_article": "Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 20, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +85%.\nRevenues are expected to be $32.81 billion, up 81.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.57% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nStory Continues\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?\nFor Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.30%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination indicates that Nvidia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.68, delivering a surprise of +6.25%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nNvidia appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Maintains Buy Rating as Rosenblatt Raises Price Target; Optimism Grows for Apple Intelligence\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nMarket Capitalization: $3.39 trillion\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide. The company is a key AI player due to its investments in AI technology and integration of AI in its offerings, such as its latest iPhone 16 which comes with new AI features.\nOn November 13, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is about to launch its very own product in the smart home market in an attempt to catch up with its rivals. The product, code-named J490, is an AI Wall Tablet for Home Control, spotlighting the new Apple Intelligence AI platform. The product is designed to be the command center in a home, performing functions such as controlling appliances, handling videoconferencing, and even using artificial intelligence to navigate apps. This new Apple gadget will be competing with Amazon\u2019s Echo Show and Echo Hub smart displays, as well as Google\u2019s Nest Hub.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.\nThe president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act \u2014 and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech\u2019s future.\nTrump hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He\u2019s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election \u2014 and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn\u2019t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.\nBut Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.\nNow, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump\u2019s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech\u2019s major players.\nAntitrust regulation\nThe Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech\u2019s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business \u201cmore fair.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect\u2019s stop at a McDonald\u2019s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,\u201d explained director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.\nAI legislation\nGenerative AI didn\u2019t take the world by storm until well after Trump\u2019s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.\nFILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nRegulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there\u2019s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.\nThe Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump\u2019s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden\u2019s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.\nHowever, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.\n\u201cWe've seen when that happens,\u201d explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. \u201cWhen that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.\u201d\nTrump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.\nThe CHIPS Act and tariffs\nThe second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.\nBut Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.\n\u201cThe CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,\u201d Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.\nBut during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.\nTariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.\n\u201cHardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,\u201d explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.\n\u201cSo whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.\u201d\nThat could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

This coordinated effort, just before Donald Trump takes office, includes stricter license restrictions on US chip firms doing business with China, added scrutiny on those that assemble their hardware in China, and an appeal to allies in Europe and Asia to follow suit. These efforts have only served to further bolster the semiconductor index in China, which leaped to a record high on November 11 amid reports that a recent US order to halt TSM chip supplies to China would accelerate efforts in Beijing to set up advanced chip manufacturing companies in the Asian country.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nChinese brokerage Cinda Securities, in a note published on the China chip situation on November 10, has said that in the medium and long term it will force the reorganization of the supply chain, increase the demand for domestic advanced process production capacity, and promote technological breakthroughs in upstream semiconductor equipment and materials.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best video conferencing stocks to buy according to analysts.\nAn Overview of The Video Conferencing Industry\nVideo conferencing software connects two or more parties virtually through video and audio over an internet connection. During the COVID-19 pandemic when lockdowns shut almost everything, the video conferencing market witnessed a surge in demand. According to a report by Grand View Research, the video conferencing market was valued at around $4.21 billion in 2020 and the valuation rose significantly to around $7 billion in 2022. Moreover, as per the most recent figures. The video conferencing market was valued at $28.61 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from $33.04 billion in 2024 to $60.17 billion by 2032, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 7.8%.\nAccording to a BBC report published on June 3rd, 2020, during the pandemic, the usage of the video conferencing platform Zoom surged 30 times in April 2020 alone. The report further highlighted that the daily participant usage exceeded 300 million users during peak pandemic times.\nREAD MORE:\u00a010 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a08 Best Industrial Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\nAt first, the market growth was driven by the pandemic and lockdowns around the globe, which forced businesses, government organizations, and education institutes to adopt virtual modes of engagement. For instance, in May 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) held its first-ever virtual assembly. Moreover, educational institutes used videoconferencing software to conduct graduation ceremonies.\nFast forwarding to the post-pandemic era now that the world is back to normal the video conferencing market is driven by the rise in remote jobs and e-learning. According to a report by Pew Research published on March 30, 2023, around 35% of the US workforce was working remotely in 2023. Although this figure was down from 43% recorded in January 2022 and 55% in October 2020, which is the pandemic era, the percentage of remote workers was still up 7% compared to pre-pandemic years.\nLooking at the regional insights, North America held the largest market share of around 31% in 2023 as it benefits from the large organizations that are engaged in developing video conferencing software. Moreover, the region is also home to an experienced workforce capable of adopting remote work. In addition to North America, the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR due to the growing interest in digitalization across businesses, governments, and educational institutes.\nStory Continues\nLooking ahead, the rise and recent developments in artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cloud technologies are expected to further boost the video conferencing market. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, global digital jobs are estimated to grow by around 25% to reach over 95 million indicating the growth prospects for video conferencing software due to its indispensable position for remotely operating organizations.\nOur Methodology\nTo curate the list of 8 best video conferencing stocks to buy according to analysts we used various internet rankings and our previous articles.

These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.\nWhy This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist\nDifferent than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Over the years, the company has witnessed increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\nGOOGL sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), holds a Growth Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of B. Earnings and sales are forecasted to increase 37.9% and 14.8% year-over-year, respectively.\n16 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.37 to $8 per share for 2024. GOOGL boasts an average earnings surprise of 11.8%.\nLooking at cash flow, Alphabet is expected to report cash flow growth of 16.7% this year; GOOGL has generated cash flow growth of 15.1% over the past three to five years.\nWith solid fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, GOOGL should be on investors' short lists.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet Inc. (GOOG).\nAlphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.34, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 50 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.34 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 50 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 6% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GOOG\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GOOG\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Alphabet, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nStory Continues\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs GOOG Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.6% over the past month to $7.99.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Alphabet.

Skyworks executed well during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024. We posted revenue of $1.025 billion. We delivered earnings per share of $1.55 and generated free cash flow of $393 million. Revenue gross margin and EPS met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance.\nOur business model continues to deliver robust cash generation. For the second year in a row, annual free cash flow was well above $1.6 billion, providing a strong foundation to invest in our technology and product road maps to support future growth.\nIn mobile, our revenue grew 21% sequentially, and we expect further growth in the December quarter as customer orders and channel inventory have normalized, and we continue to support seasonal product ramps.\nBased on our technology leadership position and in close collaboration with our mobile customers, we expand our reach, develop best-in-class high-performance connectivity solutions and drive more integration with advanced packaging, reducing the footprint and increasing energy efficiency.\nWe believe that AI is poised to ignite a transformative smart phone upgrade cycle, propelling the demand for higher levels of RF complexity. As AI capabilities continue to advance, smartphones will evolve into more sophisticated and intelligent companions demanding more powerful solutions to support their enhanced functionalities.\nWe are in the early stages of this multiyear trend and Skyworks is well positioned to capitalize on it. In broad markets, we have seen signs of stabilization and have grown modestly since the bottom in the December quarter of 2023. Despite uneven demand dynamics and high customer inventory in certain segments.\nLong term, we remain bullish on broad markets, given secular trends in Edge IoT, automotive electrification, and advanced safety systems as well as AI-enabled workloads, driving cloud and data center upgrades. In Edge IoT, demand continues to improve as customers adopt WiFi 6E and 7 systems, which carry higher dollar content due to increasing complexity and additional bands. We are in the early stages of a multiyear upgrade cycle with WiFi 7 shipments now ramping.\nAs we indicated at the beginning of the year, inventory levels in traditional data center and wireless infrastructure remain stubbornly elevated, which is delaying the recovery. We continue to undership natural demand. However, over the medium to long term, we remain bullish on our product road map and design win funnel targeting AI data centers.\nLastly, global demand remains muted in automotive and industrial markets as Tier 1s and OEMs work down excess inventory. Despite near-term headwinds, we continue to convert design wins into revenue across our connectivity, power isolation and digital broadcast solutions for the connected car and EV markets.\nTurning to our quarterly business highlights. We secured 5G content for premium Android smartphones, including Google Pixel 9, Samsung Galaxy, Oppo OnePlus and several others. We expanded our WiFi 7 design win pipeline with Linksys, Charter, NETGEAR, CommScope and TP-Link. For emerging IoT applications, we powered advanced audio solutions for wireless gaming and clinical-grade hearing aids.\nLastly, we increased our design win momentum in automotive including 5G front-end modules, infotainment and digital isolators.\nIn summary, the Skyworks team executed well despite a challenging macroeconomic climate. We intend to leverage our robust cash generation to make critical investments that drive long-term profitable growth while diversifying the overall business.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q1 of 2025.\nStory Continues\nKris Sennesael\nThanks, Liam. Skyworks revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 was $1.025 billion, slightly above the midpoint of our outlook. Mobile was approximately 65% of total revenue up 21% sequentially as we successfully supported the ramp of new products at our mobile customers. Broad markets were approximately 35% of total revenue, up $1 million sequentially. Gross profit was $476 million with gross margin at 46.5%, in line with expectations.\nGross margin grew 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting our ongoing cost reduction actions.\nAlso, during Q4, we further reduced our internal inventory, resulting in 7 consecutive quarters of reductions. Operating expenses were $203 million, reflecting our strategic investments in our technology and product road maps. We delivered $273 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 27%. We incurred $2 million of other expenses, and our effective tax rate was 8%, driving net income of $250 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.55, which is $0.03 above our guidance.\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter, we delivered impressive cash generation, with cash flow from operations at $476 million, capital expenditures at $83 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $393 million or 38% free cash flow margin. For fiscal 2024, we generated well over $1.6 billion of free cash flow, our second year in a row and ended the year with a record 40% free cash flow margin, translating into approximately $10.40 of free cash flow per share and a free cash flow yield of approximately 11.5%. We continue to drive robust cash flow through steady levels of profitability, prudent working capital management and moderating CapEx intensity.\nDuring fiscal Q4, we paid $112 million in dividends. Cash and investments grew to approximately $1.6 billion, and we have $1 billion in debt, providing us with excellent optionality. Now let's move on to our outlook for Q1 of fiscal 2025. We anticipate revenue of $1.050 billion to $1.080 billion, up 4% sequentially at the midpoint.\nWe expect our mobile business to be up mid-single digits sequentially, driven by seasonal product ramps. In broad markets, we anticipate further modest sequential growth. And a return to year-over-year growth. The pace of the recovery is more measured than we anticipated, given excess inventory in select segments like industrial, automotive, infrastructure and networking.\nGross margin is projected to be 46% to 47%, and we expect operating expenses in the range of $209 million to $215 million, with sequential increases reflecting typical adjustments made at the start of a new fiscal year, including variable compensation accruals. In addition, we are leveraging our strong cash flow generation to invest in technology and product road maps to drive share and increase diversification.\nBelow the line, we anticipate $3 million in other income an effective tax rate of 12.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 160 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range of $1.065 billion we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.57.\nOperator, let's open the line for questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Peter Peng, JPMorgan.\nPeter Peng\nGood job on the execution. Can you -- on your mobile business, can you talk about your Android portion of this? And what kind of trends are you seeing? I think your peers talked about some weaknesses there. So I know this is a smaller part of your business, but maybe you can elaborate what you're seeing in the Android part of this business?\nLiam Griffin\nSure, absolutely. In fact, we have a very robust pipeline with the Android players, specifically Google. They've been doing a great, great job and also Samsung. So we have incredible design wins there. Fortunately, they are investing in technology, the performance that we're seeing in those devices has been amazing for us.\nIt's a great match for Skyworks. It gives us an opportunity really to demonstrate our technology reach, our scale and also moving in a diversified portfolio as well. So we're doing very well as a business, and we expect much more in that company.\nKris Sennesael\nRight. And Peter, just to level set, right, our Android revenue in more than $1 billion of revenue we just did in last quarter is less than $75 million of revenue in the quarter. Roughly half of that is with Google, 30%, 40% or so is with Samsung and less than 10% is with the China players. So we definitely have derisked our position with China. We've talked about that before.\nWe are very selective as it relates to that part of the Android business with Samsung in China. We are playing with those valued customers, but only in the areas where they value what we bring to the table which is high-performance RF connectivity.\nThat plays out really well with Google. Google, who is making a lot of investments in their product road map who are switching the AI-enabled phones that drives a lot more complexity inside the phones, and that's all music to our ears, and that's why we have a strong relationship with them.\nPeter Peng\nPerfect. And then on the broad market, it's good to see you guys driving , I think, for the December quarter, that will be probably your fourth quarter of sequential growth. I know there's a lot of puts and takes in that business. But as we kind of look into 2025, can you talk about the sustainability of this recovery? Or do you think that there's going to be some seasonality that might impact growth into 2025?\nKris Sennesael\nYes. And so you're absolutely right. Our broad markets business bottomed in the December quarter of 2023, and we had now 3 quarters in a row of modest sequential growth, we are guiding to further modest sequential growth in the December quarter and a return to year-over-year growth, again, somewhat in the mid-single digits year-over-year growth in our broad markets business. We do anticipate that at a certain point, the sequential growth is going to accelerate, but we have not really seen that for now. And we all know why that is.\nThere is still some excess inventory in certain markets like automotive, industrial, infrastructure and networking.\nWe are under shipping natural demand, but eventually, that's going to clear and eventually, our growth is going to accelerate. We are very well aligned with some secular growth engines in our broad markets as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Edge IoT devices where we see an upgrade from WiFi 6 to WiFi 6E and 7, in automotive with advanced safety systems and electrification. And as well in AI data centers and networking where we play with our timing solutions. And so when I put this all together, we still believe that in the longer term, in a neutral macroeconomic environment, our broad markets business can grow mid-teens year-over-year.\nOperator\nEdward Snyder, Charter Equity Research.\nEdward Snyder\nThanks a lot. Maybe if we could touch on guys, obviously with what's going on with your largest customers has caused kind of a little bit of temporary or appears to be temporary upheaval. What's your feeling in terms of 2025, not for specific guidance on that, but it's already clear from our teardown that there's some content changes in the last flagship phone. And from what we can gather, there's going to be some additional changes.\nSo there's a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving pieces here. What's your view of -- let me put it this way, the long term, say, 2025 to 2026 in terms of your ability to gain back content when they make a big shift and then perhaps grow from there. I know we've talked of AI in the past about its impact on the RFFE, given the road map starts out for 3 years, what are you seeing in terms of generic content growth in that kind of flagship of front end from AI? And then I have a follow-up.\nLiam Griffin\nOkay. Okay. I'll unpack that with you, Edward. Yes. I mean, certainly, there's a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to grow in mobile.\nWe've got an incredible technology bench. We have the scale. We have the physical plant, and we have the flexibility to do what our customers need. And I'm sure, as you know, we have a very good partnership with our largest customers.\nSo that back and forth is always going our way. We've got great people on both sides to make it work, and we expect to have more growth. Certainly, we had the last couple of quarters weren't so great, but we're popping up now. If you look at the road map that we're putting forward, it's very, very potent, and we definitely have the team to make that execution done.\nIt's going to take a little time, of course, but we have the scale, we have the people. We have the ambition to make it happen. And most important, we have the confidence of our most important customer.\nEdward Snyder\nOkay. Maybe if I could follow up. First, housekeeping, what was the percentage of your largest customer? And then secondly, you've been underrepresented at Samsung for a while. And again, sands are shifting there in terms of the RFFE.\nWhat's the prospect for that in the next, let's say, a year or so in terms of it becoming a larger customer for you given that I think there are more open slots available to you. Are you seeing good design traction in spring or fall? Or do you get any indication of that at all right now?\nKris Sennesael\nSo Edward, in the September quarter, our largest customer was approximately 69% of our total revenue, which was up 21% sequentially. So the team really executed well, supporting our largest customer, ramping up their new products. And I'll turn it over to Liam for the rest of your question.\nLiam Griffin\nYes, sure. I mean, as we spoke, there's just tremendous opportunity there. We're diving much deeper in some of those platforms. And I would say the technology pipeline that we have at Skyworks and the investments that we've been making are really going to yield opportunities for us in growth.\nSo that's kind of what we're looking at right now. There's a lot of opportunity. We're executing. Our engineers are making incredible progress on the next-generation solutions. There's a lot more going as you get into the AI world.\nAnd you can expect that Skyworks is right there ready to go. We're under the hood, so to speak, with some really incredible people on our side and with our partners. So we should look forward to that. That work is being done now, and we look forward to putting that into products very shortly.\nOperator\nTimothy Arcuri, UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri\nKris, can you talk about what's included for the largest customer for December? It seems like you did see some pull-ins into September just like most others did. It was a little higher than what I think you thought it would be. Usually, that -- that customer is about flat in December, but maybe it's down mid because of the pull-ins. Can you kind of talk about that?\nKris Sennesael\nYes. First of all, we can't really go into the specifics as it relates with our large customer, but I can tell you that the business and the demand is fully in line with our expectations. So we didn't see any surprise in September, didn't see any or don't expect any surprise in December. The demand is in line with our expectations. And so as I just answered the question before, the large customer was up 21% sequentially in the September quarter, and we expect it to be up further in the December quarter in the 5% to 10% range on a sequential basis.\nTimothy Arcuri\nGreat, Kris. And then I noticed that the repo was quite low despite the strong free cash flow. I might have thought it would have been a little stronger. Can you kind of talk.\nKris Sennesael\nYes. Yes, absolutely. So first of all, I want to highlight here as well that we do have very strong free cash flow. And as we indicated in the prepared remarks, right, for the second time in a row, more than $1.6 billion of free cash flow. And that does take into account that we continue to make the necessary investments in our business.\nWe continue to strengthen our technology and product road maps, and there's no hesitation there. We know where the opportunities are, we are making the necessary investments there to capture those opportunities. In addition to that, we continue to invest in our manufacturing footprint, although at a much more moderate pace as we have seen in the last couple of years, but we continue to invest there as well, and so our free cash flow is very strong.\nOur balance sheet is very healthy. We have $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet and only $1 billion in debt with no near-term maturities, and so we have plenty of optionality. We have optionality to do M&A, although you know us, we're going to remain disciplined, but we have that optionality. And we have optionality to return excess cash back to the shareholders through a combination of our dividend program and our share buyback program.\nOn the dividend program, we just recently increased the dividend 3% to now $0.70 per share and so that's turning into a really nice dividend yield. And we have the optionality to do buybacks. The Board and the management team are taking into account and into consideration multiple elements. But as a matter of policy, I can't really share the details of those considerations. Having said that, it's our intent to continue to return all the excess cash back to the shareholders over time.\nOperator\nKrish Sankar, TD Cowen.\nKrish Sankar\nLiam and Kris, thanks for the color on the December quarter, your large customer. I'm just kind of curious, when you look at the December quarter compared to history, how is the demand linearity trending? And what does that imply for March quarter seasonality? I had a follow-up.\nKris Sennesael\nSo again, I will repeat what I just answered on the previous question, right? It is fully playing in line with what we expected, a strong ramp in September followed with further ramp going into the December quarter. Obviously, March is seasonally down, and we expect here again, our March quarter, especially in mobile to be seasonally down.\nObviously, we only guide one quarter at a time. So it's too early to be more specific. We do, however, our broad markets business to continue to grow sequentially, and we expect broad markets to be up modestly in the March quarter and beyond. But as combined, of course, for Skyworks, we will have normal or expect normal seasonal declines into the March quarter.\nKrish Sankar\nGot it. Really appreciate that. And then a quick follow-up on the WiFi 7 upgrade cycle. It seems like it's been pretty good for you. I'm just curious like historically, how long has the growth inflection lasted for a WiFi upgrade cycle?\nAnd how should we think about how this profile would be versus prior cycles?\nLiam Griffin\nSure, sure. Yes. I mean, actually, you're right, the WiFi cycle had been somewhat muted here for a while. Fortunately, with the Skyworks team, we're in great position. The next generations WiFi solutions, WiFi 7.\nWe're working with companies like Motorola. We're looking at companies like Logitech. We've got some automotive plays in there as well.\nSo the broad market businesses are coming up. It's been -- it had been kind of a rough ride there, but we're starting to look better. NETGEAR is another play we're in there, Charter Communications, we're in industrial markets. We're engaged with Mercedes-Benz even on the auto side. So there's been a lot of activity and strength here in the broad markets.\nIt's just that the design win pipeline is filling, and we'll get that through revenue. So we're very encouraged about the signs we're seeing there.\nOperator\nVivek Arya, Bank of America Securities.\nMichael Mani\nThis is Michael Mani on for Vivek Arya. To start, just across the various end markets that broad markets plays in, which areas have become maybe incrementally worse or better over the last 90 days? And just where are you still undershipping to demand?\nKris Sennesael\nSo in broad markets, right, there's three parts. There is the Edge IoT connectivity where we play mostly with WiFi, but any other wireless connectivity protocol. We've definitely seen improvements in that area, again, in part driven by a big step-up in content as the transitioning -- the multiyear transitioning is happening from WiFi 6 to 6E and 7. I think we're still somewhat undershipping natural demand there, but there is definitely improvement in that area.\nSecond part is our networking infrastructure and cloud. I think that's very well documented there. There is excess inventory that's being worked down. That will take multiple quarters. I think we started seeing some improvements there.\nBookings is improving. Backlog is improving, but it's still shipping way under natural demand. And then last but not least, you have automotive and industrial. I think that's very well documented as well by many of our peers who talked about that part of the business.\nWe're definitely undershipping natural demand there. Again, we are -- I think we're doing fairly well given some design wins that we have able to put on the book a year or two years ago. Those design wins continue to ramp up and turn into revenue, but it's a soft environment. And so I think that will continue to improve over time here. And that's why, as a whole, we are pleased on one hand that our markets continue to grow sequentially, although modestly.\nBut eventually, that sequential growth will accelerate. Again, December year-over-year growth and that year-over-year growth will accelerate over time as well.\nMichael Mani\nGreat. And then just on gross margins. Given that broad markets might be taking a more measured upturn expected previously, what are the puts and takes for gross margin expansion from here? I know you guided December contract essentially flat at the midpoint, but how do you think about expansion into 2025? And then maybe more broadly, as you think about an eventual return to 50% or greater gross margins, what would you rank order as the most important drivers to achieve this between utilization, product mix and a recovery in broad markets or any other factors?\nKris Sennesael\nYes. So as it relates to gross margin, we did 46.5% in September, which was up 50 basis points, so that's a step in the right direction. For December, we guide 46% to 47%, so kind of flattish at the midpoint, but the range is 46% to 47%. Looking ahead to fiscal '25 and longer term, as you called out correctly, we drive gross margin improvements through better factory utilization through cost reductions, and we have a mix tailwind because broad markets has above-average gross margin compared to the mobile.\nI think the team continued to execute well. We start seeing some improvement on the factory utilization. The team is executing well on cost reductions internally as well as externally. But as we talked already, the mix tailwind is not blowing as strong as we initially anticipated, right? I think over time, broad markets will accelerate.\nBut currently, the sequential growth is modestly. And so the mix tailwind there is not as strong as expected.\nAs a result of that, for now, we think that fiscal '25 on a full year basis, gross margins is going to be flattish compared to fiscal '24. It will, of course, start improving towards the end of fiscal '25 and set us up well for further gross margin expansions in fiscal '26 and beyond. We want to get as fast as we can back to the 50% gross margin. And then we're going to keep grinding to our long-term target model of 53%.\nOperator\nKarl Ackerman, BNP Paribas.\nKarl Ackerman\nKris, I just want to follow up on that gross margin comment with regard to fiscal '25. I guess, do you have an inventory days target because you continue to make good strides in reducing inventory days now in the 130 range, broad markets continues to improve. And so if inventory days are at normal, presumably margins should go up. So again, maybe tying the inventory days comment with what your comments just were around gross margins and how we see that stepping up over the next couple of quarters?\nKris Sennesael\nYes. First of all, we have been reducing our internal inventory for seven quarters in a row now. It peaked at well above $1.2 billion, and we are down now to less than $800 million. I think we can continue to drive inventory down a little bit more. Obviously, that's not helping from a factory utilization point of view.\nIt's not helping from a gross margin point of view. But I think it's the right thing to do.\nWe want to rightsize the inventory. And I think we still can reduce that a little bit. And so again, when you put it all together there, I think gross margin is going to be flattish in fiscal '25 start improving towards -- and we will have seasonality there, right? We will have seasonality.\nTypically, gross margins go down in the March and June quarter and then start improving in the September and December quarter. Inventory days, again, there is seasonality, and so revenue goes up and down. The inventory doesn't follow necessarily the seasonality on the revenue side. But from an absolute dollars point of view, we're sub $800 million, continue to drive it down a little bit further.\nKarl Ackerman\nGot it. As my follow-up, do you believe the M&A environment is more favorable from a regulatory and funding perspective in '25? And if not, because of your very strong free cash flow generation and perhaps ability to further reduce inventory, can you be more aggressive on the buyback, if so?\nLiam Griffin\nYes. I mean there's all kinds of options that we have with the cash flow that we've been putting forth, which is a great, great tool for us. So we're always looking for the optimal mix, whether it's an M&A play or whether another factor. And so those are great options for Skyworks, and it's a testament of the ability to drive that cash, and it's going to be a hallmark of this company.\nSo we look at everything. We're very disciplined. We think about our shareholders. We think about the longevity of the technology, and it's been a strategy that's worked quite well, and I think it will continue to be really purposeful for us as we go forward.\nOperator\nRuben Roy, Stifel.\nRuben Roy\nLiam, I had a question on Edge IoT to start with. And just wondering, how are you thinking about AI impact, if any, on the Edge IoT business? You've talked a lot about the smartphone side of it. Just wondering if there's anything investors should be thinking about in terms of AI and potential impacts as we look out over the next 12, 18 months?\nLiam Griffin\nYes, absolutely. So I think we've got a couple of things. Certainly, on the smartphone side, we are deeply entrenched with the most important customers learning together, executing and driving excellence. So that's really, really key, and we're doing great work there. And then -- but then now flipping back to the broad markets, we're doing very, very well in the IoT space and really engaging with companies that are real hallmarks in the business.\nWe talked about Google and Samsung, but also the broad markets businesses. We've got design wins with Mercedes. We have design wins with NETGEAR, Cambium Networks, Motorola, really, really meaningful companies that are now part of that portfolio that we have in broad markets. And I'm 100% confident our team will continue to drive that with more opportunities, more diversification and more cash and more earnings for us. So look forward to that, but things look much better there in that market.\nRuben Roy\nAnd a couple of quick ones for Kris. Kris, can you tell us about the impairment charge during the quarter and what that was related to? And then finally, on CapEx ticked up a little bit. Any initial view on how we should think about CapEx for fiscal '25?\nKris Sennesael\nRight. So we did take an impairment charge in Q4 of fiscal '24, which was related to in-process R&D related to the I&A acquisition we did with Silicon Labs. As you probably know, at the time of an acquisition, you have to identify all the in-process R&D projects and have to put a valuation around that.\nAs time goes by, some projects are being accelerated. Some projects are being pushed out. Some projects are being redefined. And so that's all being taken into account and could potentially result in an impairment charge, which we took in Q4.\nThe business itself that we acquired is part of our broad markets business. We are going through some inventory correction there because a lot of that business plays in the industrial automotive area. But we are still very pleased with that business. That business has great technology, great people, good customer contacts. And as we get through the inventory correction is well positioned for growth.\nAs it relates to CapEx, CapEx is running in fiscal '24 on or about 3% to revenue, which has been one of the lowest in many, many years. Part of that, of course, is we didn't have to do any capacity expansion CapEx during fiscal '24, but all the CapEx we did was mostly for technology reasons. Going forward, we think CapEx will remain moderate mid- to longer term in the mid-single digits as a percent to revenue.\nOperator\nSrini Pajjuri, Raymond James.\nSrini Pajjuri\nA couple of follow-ups. Kris, on the broad market side, there are a lot of moving parts in there. Just trying to understand how big auto, industrial and IoT and infrastructure businesses are individually. And also, you talked about some inventory on the infrastructure and cloud networking. I think you have a bit more exposure on the telco side.\nI just want to make sure because from everything that we see and hear, the cloud business is very strong right now. So I'm just curious as to what's causing that inventory build.\nKris Sennesael\nYes. So our broad markets, it's roughly 40%, 50% is the Edge IoT connectivity, 35%, 40% or so is our networking infrastructure and cloud and then 20%, 25% is industrial and automotive. As it relates to cloud and data center, we do see some good traction in the AI-related investments that -- where we play with our timing solutions, but investments in the more traditional cloud and data is somewhat muted, and there is still some ongoing inventory correction in that part of the market.\nSrini Pajjuri\nOkay. That's clear. And then on the -- I guess, on the December guidance, you talked -- you kind of mentioned that everything is kind of tracking as you expected originally, but it is slightly below your normal seasonality. I think historically, you have done kind of high single digits in December. So my question is, is that primarily on the Android side, the weakness or broad markets?\nAnd then given the lower base, should we expect your March quarter to be slightly above seasonal?\nKris Sennesael\nRight. So the revenue and the business with the large customer is fully in line with expectations and more normal from a seasonal point of view. The -- we're guiding slightly below Street expectation mostly because of broad markets. Again, on one hand, pleased that we continue to see for the fourth quarter in a row sequential growth, but the sequential growth is less than what we anticipated three or six months ago.\nOperator\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Group.\nVijay Rakesh\nKris, just wondering on 2025, if you were to take a look at how do you see handset growth year-on-year and within that 5G? And then a follow-up.\nKris Sennesael\nSo we only guide one quarter at a time, and we're going to stick to that. I mean visibility is, I think, okay. It's not bad or great. But as a matter, we only guide one quarter at a time, and we're going to stick to that.\nVijay Rakesh\nGot it. I was talking more of the industry. But as you look at -- one of the things that one of your peers have talked about is in China, there's been a trend towards entry level and some of the RF side moving to discrete. Are you seeing any of that? That's it.\nLiam Griffin\nYes. We actually don't do much in China in those markets. And if we were, they're really low-end stuff. And so we're naturally kind of out of that space and upgrading more with some of the other players that we talked about earlier, the Googles and Samsungs, et cetera. So we still have a great Android business.\nIt just happens to be a much more important strategic one.\nOperator\nNicolas Doyle, Needham & Company.\nNicolas Doyle\nYou mentioned tremendous opportunity in Android. Can you be any more specific in terms of products or maybe the connectivity, if it's RF or WiFi type opportunities? And I guess I assume that's mostly with Google.\nLiam Griffin\nYes. I mean you have two really strong players here that we're engaging with Google and Samsung. And what I really like about those companies is that they are -- these are enterprise companies. It's great that they're smartphone players, and we can engage, that's wonderful, but they're also technology companies.\nThey are companies that play in AI and other markets. So it's really a great opportunity for us. We're pleased that we're able to engage at that level. We're learning a lot from those customers, very, very smart people with a lot of ideas and a lot of applications. So it's a broad market business of its own within the portfolio.\nSo you should expect more from us with those companies. We're making great progress and looking forward to continuing to raise the bar. And so we're happy to be there.\nNicolas Doyle\nOkay. And maybe just a broader strategy question. You've seen broad markets grow modestly quarter-over-quarter, yet you've been under shipping kind of this whole time. So why not halt those shipments more aggressively at the beginning of the year and kind of burn through that inventory quicker? Is there any sort of business strategy around that decision?\nOr that's just how business goes?\nKris Sennesael\nI mean we're always very careful. And when we talk about inventory, we talk about inventory in the channel and at the customer level. And we're always trying to get a good read about that. And there's no advantage or any good reason to go and build up channel inventory or excess inventory at the customer level.\nWe're always trying to ship in line with real end customer demand. Now sometimes our customers don't have it right either, and they are pounding the table to get more parts and then their end customer demand doesn't materialize and you end up with excess inventory somewhere in the channel could be at the distribution or could be at the end customer. Nobody wants that, and we're always trying to manage that very carefully.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.\nLiam Griffin\nThanks for participating on today's call. We look forward to talking to you at upcoming investor conferences during the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI was on the cusp of a milestone. The startup finished an initial round of training in September for a massive new artificial intelligence model that it hoped would significantly surpass prior versions of the technology behind ChatGPT and move closer to its goal of powerful AI that outperforms humans.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThe Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions\nArizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump\nBut the model, known internally as Orion, did not hit the company\u2019s desired performance, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss company matters. As of late summer, for example, Orion fell short when trying to answer coding questions that it hadn\u2019t been trained on, the people said. Overall, Orion is so far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5, the system that originally powered the company\u2019s flagship chatbot, the people said.\nOpenAI isn\u2019t alone in hitting stumbling blocks recently. After years of pushing out increasingly sophisticated AI products at a breakneck pace, three of the leading AI companies are now seeing diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build newer models. At Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, an upcoming iteration of its Gemini software is not living up to internal expectations, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Anthropic, meanwhile, has seen the timetable slip for the release of its long-awaited Claude model called 3.5 Opus.\nThe companies are facing several challenges. It\u2019s become increasingly difficult to find new, untapped sources of high-quality, human-made training data that can be used to build more advanced AI systems. Orion\u2019s unsatisfactory coding performance was due in part to the lack of sufficient coding data to train on, two people said. At the same time, even modest improvements may not be enough to justify the tremendous costs associated with building and operating new models, or to live up to the expectations that come with branding a product as a major upgrade.\nThere is plenty of potential to make these models better. OpenAI has been putting Orion through a months-long process often referred to as post-training, according to one of the people. That procedure, which is routine before a company releases new AI software publicly, includes incorporating human feedback to improve responses and refining the tone for how the model should interact with users, among other things. But Orion is still not at the level OpenAI would want in order to release it to users, and the company is unlikely to roll out the system until early next year, one person said. The Information previously reported some details of OpenAI\u2019s challenges developing its new model, including with coding tasks.\nStory Continues\nThese issues challenge the gospel that has taken hold in Silicon Valley in recent years, particularly since OpenAI released ChatGPT two years ago. Much of the tech industry has bet on so-called scaling laws that say more computing power, data and larger models will inevitably pave the way for greater leaps forward in the power of AI.The recent setbacks also raise doubts about the heavy investment in AI and the feasibility of reaching an overarching goal these companies are aggressively pursuing: artificial general intelligence. The term typically refers to hypothetical AI systems that would match or exceed humans on many intellectual tasks. The chief executives of OpenAI and Anthropic have previously said AGI may be only several years away.\n\u201cThe AGI bubble is bursting a little bit,\u201d said Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at AI startup Hugging Face. It\u2019s become clear, she said, that \u201cdifferent training approaches\u201d may be needed to make AI models work really well on a variety of tasks \u2014 an idea a number of experts in artificial intelligence echoed to Bloomberg News.\nIn a statement, a Google DeepMind spokesperson said the company is \u201cpleased with the progress we\u2019re seeing on Gemini and we\u2019ll share more when we\u2019re ready.\u201d OpenAI declined to comment. Anthropic declined to comment, but referred Bloomberg News to a five-hour podcast featuring Chief Executive Officer Dario Amodei that was released Monday.\n\u201cPeople call them scaling laws. That\u2019s a misnomer,\u201d he said on the podcast. \u201cThey\u2019re not laws of the universe. They\u2019re empirical regularities. I am going to bet in favor of them continuing, but I\u2019m not certain of that.\u201d\nAmodei said there are \u201clots of things\u201d that could \u201cderail\u201d the process of reaching more powerful AI in the next few years, including the possibility that \u201cwe could run out of data.\u201d But Amodei said he\u2019s optimistic AI companies will find a way to get over any hurdles.\nPlateauing Performance\nThe technology that underpins ChatGPT and a wave of rival AI chatbots was built on a trove of social media posts, online comments, books and other data freely scraped from around the web. That was enough to create products that can spit out clever essays and poems, but building AI systems that are smarter than a Nobel laureate \u2014 as some companies hope to do \u2014 may require data sources other than Wikipedia posts and YouTube captions.\nThese efforts are slower going and costlier than simply scraping the web. Tech companies are also turning to synthetic data, such as computer-generated images or text meant to mimic content created by real people. But here, too, there are limits. \u201cIt is less about quantity and more about quality and diversity of data,\u201d said Lila Tretikov, head of AI strategy at New Enterprise Associates and former deputy chief technology officer at Microsoft. \u201cWe can generate quantity synthetically, yet we struggle to get unique, high-quality datasets without human guidance, especially when it comes to language.\u201d\nStill, AI companies continue to pursue a more-is-better playbook. In their quest to build products that approach the level of human intelligence, tech firms are increasing the amount of computing power, data and time they use to train new models \u2014 and driving up costs in the process. Amodei has said companies will spend $100 million to train a bleeding-edge model this year and that amount will hit $100 billion in the coming years.\nAs costs rise, so do the stakes and expectations for each new model under development. Noah Giansiracusa, an associate professor of mathematics at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts, said AI models will keep improving, but the rate at which that will happen is questionable.\n\u201cWe got very excited for a brief period of very fast progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThat just wasn\u2019t sustainable.\u201d\nSilicon Valley\u2019s Conundrum\nThis conundrum has come into focus in recent months inside Silicon Valley. In March, Anthropic released a set of three new models and said the most powerful option, called Claude Opus, outperformed OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Google\u2019s Gemini systems on key benchmarks, such as graduate-level reasoning and coding.\nOver the next few months, Anthropic pushed out updates to the other two Claude models \u2013 but not Opus. \u201cThat was the one everyone was excited about,\u201d said Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher. By October, Willison and other industry watchers noticed that wording related to 3.5 Opus, including an indication that it would arrive \u201clater this year\u201d and was \u201ccoming soon,\u201d was removed from some pages on the company\u2019s website.\nSimilar to its competitors, Anthropic has been facing challenges behind the scenes to develop 3.5 Opus, according to two people familiar with the matter. After training it, Anthropic found 3.5 Opus performed better on evaluations than the older version but not by as much as it should, given the size of the model and how costly it was to build and run, one of the people said.\nAn Anthropic spokesperson said the language about Opus was removed from the website as part of a marketing decision to only show available and benchmarked models. Asked whether Opus 3.5 would still be coming out this year, the spokesperson pointed to Amodei\u2019s podcast remarks. In the interview, the CEO said Anthropic still plans to release the model but repeatedly declined to commit to a timetable.\nTech companies are also beginning to wrestle with whether to keep offering their older AI models, perhaps with some additional improvements, or to shoulder the costs of supporting hugely expensive new versions that may not perform much better.\nGoogle has released updates to its flagship AI model Gemini to make it more useful, including restoring the ability to generate images of people, but introduced few major breakthroughs in the quality of the underlying model. OpenAI, meanwhile, has focused on a number of comparatively incremental updates this year, such as a new version of a voice assistant feature that lets users have more fluid spoken conversations with ChatGPT.\nMore recently, OpenAI rolled out a preview version of a model called o1 that spends extra time computing an answer before responding to a query, a process the company refers to as reasoning. Google is working on a similar approach, with the goal of handling more complex queries and yielding better responses over time.\nTech firms also face meaningful tradeoffs with diverting too much of their coveted computing resources to developing and running larger models that may not be significantly better.\n\u201cAll of these models have gotten quite complex and we can\u2019t ship as many things in parallel as we\u2019d like to,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in response to a question on a recent Ask Me Anything session on Reddit. The ChatGPT-maker faces \u201ca lot of limitations and hard decisions,\u201d he said, about how it decides what to do with its available computing power.\nAltman said OpenAI will have some \u201cvery good releases\u201d later this year, but that list won\u2019t include GPT-5 \u2014 a name many in the AI industry would expect the company to use for a big release following GPT-4, which was introduced more than 18 months ago.\nLike Google and Anthropic, OpenAI is now shifting attention from the size of these models to newer use cases, including a crop of AI tools called agents that can book flights or send emails on a user\u2019s behalf. \u201cWe will have better and better models,\u201d Altman wrote on Reddit. \u201cBut I think the thing that will feel like the next giant breakthrough will be agents.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nA Guide to Trump\u2019s Tariff Plans: Expect High Drama and a Bumpy Rollout\nNorth Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\nOh, the Irony.

          "whole_article": "The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.\nThe president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act \u2014 and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech\u2019s future.\nTrump hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He\u2019s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election \u2014 and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn\u2019t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.\nBut Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.\nNow, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump\u2019s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech\u2019s major players.\nAntitrust regulation\nThe Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech\u2019s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business \u201cmore fair.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect\u2019s stop at a McDonald\u2019s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,\u201d explained director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.\nAI legislation\nGenerative AI didn\u2019t take the world by storm until well after Trump\u2019s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.\nFILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nRegulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there\u2019s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.\nThe Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump\u2019s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden\u2019s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.\nHowever, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.\n\u201cWe've seen when that happens,\u201d explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. \u201cWhen that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.\u201d\nTrump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.\nThe CHIPS Act and tariffs\nThe second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.\nBut Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.\n\u201cThe CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,\u201d Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.\nBut during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.\nTariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.\n\u201cHardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,\u201d explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.\n\u201cSo whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.\u201d\nThat could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAdding more mobile startups would complement the portfolio Microsoft acquired last year from its $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, Spencer said. Nonetheless, he pointed out that Microsoft is now more focused on integrating Activision's personnel, hence significant acquisitions are unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\"We definitely want to be in the market, and when we can find teams and technology and capability that add to what we're trying to do in gaming at Microsoft, absolutely we will keep our heads up,\" Spencer said. He noted that there is nothing \"imminent.\"\nSpencer also highlighted intentions to expand Xbox's game development teams, stressing China. Through a partnership with Tencent (TCEHY, Financials), Microsoft recently debuted a new mobile edition of their venerable game, Age of Empires. The real opportunity is to partner with creative teams in China for global reach, Spencer said.\nMicrosoft's gaming business wants to maximize the functionality of the Xbox software on current handheld devices and work with hardware makers to guarantee Xbox game compatibility in the near future.\nAbout the intended mobile game web store, Spencer mentioned that debut has been postponed for more market research. Xbox President Sarah Bond first revealed the store in May, then anticipated it to open in July. In this regard, Apple's (AAPL, Financials) App Store and Alphabet's (GOOGL, Financials) Google Play remain leaders, so posing a challenge for Microsoft.\nSpencer, seeing expansion in cloud, PC, and console gaming, is hopeful about Xbox's future.

Vodafone's decision to roll out the service to 68,000 employees following trials that demonstrated average time savings of three hours per person per week represents a significant vote of confidence. Similarly, UBS' commitment to deploy 50,000 seats, marking Microsoft's largest financial services deal to date, indicates strong traction in the crucial banking sector.\nDeveloper Tools and Platform Expansion\nThe GitHub ecosystem continues to show impressive momentum, with Copilot Enterprise customers increasing 55% quarter over quarter. The launch of GitHub Copilot Workspace and Autofix features, which help developers fix vulnerabilities three times faster, demonstrates Microsoft's commitment to innovation in the developer tools market. The introduction of GitHub Spark further expands the platform's reach by enabling natural language app development.\nHealthcare and Industry-Specific Solutions Drive Growth\nMicrosoft's vertical integration strategy is showing particular success in healthcare, where DAX Copilot now processes over 1.3 million physician-patient encounters monthly across more than 500 healthcare organizations. The service's revenue growth is outpacing GitHub Copilot's first-year performance, suggesting strong potential in industry-specific applications.\nSecurity and Infrastructure Investment\nThe company's commitment to security remains paramount, with the Secure Future Initiative engaging 34,000 full-time equivalent engineers. This substantial investment, while necessary, impacts near-term profitability. Microsoft's Defender has helped secure over 750,000 GenAI app instances, while Purview has audited more than a billion Copilot interactions.\nStory Continues\nBusiness Applications and LinkedIn Show Strong Momentum\nDynamics 365 continues to gain market share, with monthly active users of Copilot across CRM and ERP solutions increasing more than 60% quarter over quarter. LinkedIn's performance remains strong, with double-digit growth in key markets like India and Brazil, and a 6x quarter-over-quarter increase in weekly immersive video views.\nEnterprise Integration Shows Promise\nEnterprise customers are showing strong confidence in Copilot's capabilities, as evidenced by major deployments like Vodafone's 68,000-employee rollout and UBS' 50,000-seat implementation \u2014 the largest in the financial services sector to date. Notable efficiency gains, such as Vodafone's reported three hours saved per employee per week, demonstrate tangible business value that could drive further adoption.\nDeveloper Tools and Platform Growth\nGitHub Copilot's momentum continues with a 55% quarter-over-quarter increase in Enterprise customers. The introduction of GitHub Copilot Workspace and Autofix features, along with the new GitHub Spark platform, positions Microsoft strongly in the developer tools market. The company reports that Copilot Autofix helps developers fix vulnerabilities three times faster than traditional methods.\nHealthcare and Industry-Specific Applications Show Promise\nDAX Copilot's rapid adoption in healthcare, now processing more than 1.3 million physician-patient encounters monthly across 500+ organizations, demonstrates Microsoft's successful vertical integration strategy. The service is reportedly growing faster than GitHub Copilot did in its first year, suggesting potential for sustained growth in industry-specific applications.\nInvestment Perspective: Patience May Be Rewarded\nWhile Microsoft's AI initiatives demonstrate impressive growth and adoption metrics, several factors suggest investors might benefit from waiting for better entry points. Management expects H2 revenue growth to remain relatively stable compared with the second quarter, with M365 Copilot seat revenues projected to grow gradually over time. The significant allocation of resources to security and infrastructure development may impact near-term margins.\n\nThe AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with tech giants like Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, Nvidia NVDA and Oracle ORCL making significant investments and advancements in the field. Microsoft's success will hinge on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and effectively monetize its AI technologies. Additionally, looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to the AI-driven growth prospects of the industry.\n\nWith a 12.5% year-to-date gain, Microsoft has underperformed both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500 index\u2019s return of 29.5% and 26.3%, respectively. This raises a crucial question of whether MSFT's AI advancements will provide the needed boost to its stock performance.\nYear-to-date Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCurrent stock prices may already reflect much of the near-term growth potential from AI initiatives. Microsoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.78X exceeding both the Zacks Computer - Software industry average of 7.93X and its own historical median of 10.15X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about potential limitations and whether the company's performance can justify this premium in the long term.\n\nAs Microsoft navigates these challenges, investors will be closely watching its ability to translate AI innovations into tangible financial results and market outperformance.\nMSFT\u2019s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion\nFor current shareholders, the strong adoption metrics and enterprise customer wins suggest holding positions could be rewarding over the long term. However, new investors might benefit from waiting for more attractive entry points, particularly given the general market volatility and the possibility of short-term fluctuations as the company continues to invest heavily in AI infrastructure and security measures.

This coordinated effort, just before Donald Trump takes office, includes stricter license restrictions on US chip firms doing business with China, added scrutiny on those that assemble their hardware in China, and an appeal to allies in Europe and Asia to follow suit. These efforts have only served to further bolster the semiconductor index in China, which leaped to a record high on November 11 amid reports that a recent US order to halt TSM chip supplies to China would accelerate efforts in Beijing to set up advanced chip manufacturing companies in the Asian country.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nChinese brokerage Cinda Securities, in a note published on the China chip situation on November 10, has said that in the medium and long term it will force the reorganization of the supply chain, increase the demand for domestic advanced process production capacity, and promote technological breakthroughs in upstream semiconductor equipment and materials. Many Chinese firms are reliant on TSM chips - 11% of TSM revenue is linked to China - and analysts expect these firms to undergo short-term pain from the US measures, but back them to emerge stronger in the long term due to improvement of domestic chip manufacturing.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Microsoft's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nThe top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company\nInsiders have sold recently\nEvery investor in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Microsoft, beginning with the chart below.\nView our latest analysis for Microsoft\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Microsoft?\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nMicrosoft already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Microsoft's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Microsoft. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. With 7.5% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nInsider Ownership Of Microsoft\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\nStory Continues\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Microsoft Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.0b of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Microsoft. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Virtual Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best virtual reality stocks.\nOverview of the Global VR Market\nVirtual Reality is a computer-generated simulation that allows users to interact with a three-dimensional environment. The four elements that characterize virtual reality and differentiate it from other technologies such as augmented reality and mixed reality are a 3D-simulated environment, immersion, sensory engagement, and realistic interactivity, as revealed by HP.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global virtual reality market size was valued at $25.11 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow from $32.64 billion in 2024 to $244.84 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 28.6% during the forecast period (2024-2032).\nRegion-wise, North America is expected to dominate the global VR market over the forecast period. Another rapidly growing region is Asia Pacific with growth driven by the rising demand for immersive technologies in emerging economies. China, one of the major distributors of head-mounted VR devices and other hardware, is forecasted to have the highest market share in the region. Simultaneously, Europe is the early adopter of virtual solutions in the automotive industry and will be experiencing significant growth, with Germany and the UK as its leading markets.\nHow is Virtual Reality Transforming Today's World?\nThe virtual reality devices used today have their foundation laid on the first head-mounted augmented reality display \"The Sword of Damocles\"\u00a0which was introduced by Ivan Sutherland in 1968. While firms such as Sega and Nintendo developed VR gaming systems in the 1980s and 1990s, it was not until the 2010s that high-quality VR headsets boasting powerful graphics and motion-tracking technology came to the market.\nWhile gaming has been driving the popularity of VR, the potential of the technology has been realized in a multitude of other industries. The American shipping company UPS committed to millions for the advanced training of its drivers, with the firm\u2019s industry-leading training powered by the use of virtual reality in an industrial training environment. Before drivers operate an actual delivery vehicle, the company's Driving Simulator provides realistic driving experiences.\nVirtual reality and augmented reality have also penetrated the healthcare sector as they offer transformative opportunities for medical training, patient care, and therapeutic interventions. The treatment domains in which these technologies are used to treat patients are diverse and include pediatric diagnostics and treatments, pain management, mental health, neurological disorders, surgery planning, intraoperative procedures, telemedicine, as well as post-operative and other rehabilitation therapies. The penetration is evident from the fact that the US FDA has authorized 69 medical devices that incorporate augmented reality and virtual reality.\nStory Continues\nVirtual Reality is also changing the game for the entertainment industry, especially for artists. Fortnite witnessed a record turnout of more than 12 million attendees to its virtual concert featuring the hip-hop superstar Travis Scott in 2020.\u00a0Therefore, VR applications continue to spread around today\u2019s world. The renowned luxury car manufacturer BMW has materialized virtual reality experiences in the automotive space. The company expanded its revolutionary driving experience with BMW M Mixed Reality which tends to blur the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds through state-of-the-art VR/MR technologies.\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nOur Methodology\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now, we utilized stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies with the highest market caps. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nThe renowned technology company Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) empowers people and organizations to achieve more with technology. The company has segments namely Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Microsoft sells its products through OEMs, distributors, and resellers as well as directly through digital marketplaces, online, and retail stores.\nMicrosoft is an important player in the VR space. The company focuses on enterprises with its HoloLens device, an ergonomic, untethered self-contained holographic device with enterprise-ready applications to increase user accuracy and output. HoloLens 2 combined with software solutions is a hands-free computer that goes where one goes, sees what one sees, and does what one says. It enables acting with precision and working together with those who are remote on a holographic canvas overlayed in one\u2019s physical environment. HoloLens 2 has diverse applications in industries including manufacturing, education, and healthcare.\nAdditionally, Microsoft Mesh is a platform for creating and sharing immersive 3D spaces for realistic virtual connections. Mesh encompasses an avatar system, spatial audio, virtual event production tools, and synchronizes experiences and interactivity across users on PC and VR. Leading companies such as Accenture are using Microsoft Mesh to expand its digital campus, One Accenture Park, to elevate onboarding and train new employees globally while PwC is bringing employees together to strengthen the company culture with immersive wellness experiences, such as guided and self-led tours and orientations.\nFor the FY25 Q1, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recorded revenue of $65.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year. The firm witnessed a solid start to its fiscal year, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue. The segments remained robust. Revenue in Productivity and Business Processes was up 12%, revenue in Intelligent Cloud increased 20%, and revenue in More Personal Computing climbed 17%, year-over-year. Simultaneously, the firm\u2019s AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter which will mark it as the fastest business in MSFT\u2019s history to hit this milestone.\nThus, the growth opportunities for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to look forward to are vast. The company can potentially continue enabling immersive experiences which are experiencing rising attention in today\u2019s ever-evolving and innovating world. The stock is held by 279 hedge funds, as of 2024\u2019s second quarter.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of\u00a0 best virtual reality stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Buying another mobile company would add to titles Microsoft picked up in its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year, he said.\n\u201cWe definitely want to be in the market, and when we can find teams and technology and capability that add to what we\u2019re trying to do in gaming at Microsoft, absolutely we will keep our heads up,\u201d Spencer said. Still, there\u2019s nothing \u201cimminent\u201d and very large deals are probably off the table at present as the company is spending a lot of time absorbing Activision Blizzard employees, he said.\nMicrosoft wants to diversify the teams working on games by looking more to China, he said. The company developed a new mobile version of Age of Empires, a world-building franchise that first appeared in the 1990s, by partnering with Tencent Holdings Ltd. Microsoft and Tencent released the game globally in October.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good area for us to learn from creative teams that have real unique capability,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThe real opportunity is to partner with creative teams in China for global.\u201d\nThe executive, who has repeatedly professed his admiration for handheld game devices, said the \u201cexpectation is that we would do something\u201d in that category. Although the company is working on prototypes and considering what it might do, Spencer also asked his group to look at the market and develop its vision based on what it learns. Such a device is a few years out, he said.\nIn the coming months, designers and engineers will focus on making the Xbox app work better on existing portable devices and partnering with hardware makers to make sure their products sync with Xbox games and experiences, he said. The Xbox app right now is good rather than great on some of these gadgets, he said.\n\u201cLonger term, I love us building devices,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAnd I think our team could do some real innovative work, but we want to be informed by learning and what\u2019s happening now.\u201d\nStory Continues\nThe company\u2019s planned online store for mobile games has been delayed as the group does additional research on the market, Spencer said. Xbox President Sarah Bond had announced the store in May, with a planned release date of July. But staffers are still talking to mobile developers, including those responsible for Microsoft-owned Candy Crush and Call of Duty Mobile, to figure out a plan. As regulatory cases involving Apple Inc.\u2019s iOS and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Android mobile stores work their way through courts in various countries, Microsoft still doesn\u2019t have an effective way to get its own store on mobile phones.\n\u201cSo a web store would mean somebody doesn't have to go into the app store to try to install something, but you still have to have a way to find the store,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cIf we\u2019re just hoping, like, if we build it, they will come, I\u2019m going to bet that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nThat means Xbox has to make its store unique for players and figure out what will draw content creators. At the same time, it\u2019s preparing for a world where Apple and Google mobile devices are more open to Xbox.\n\u201cI think the ball is moving in the right direction,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI think this idea of open platforms, where users have more choice, creators have more choice, you see the momentum, right?\u201d\nAfter releasing the first batch of Xbox games for Sony Group Corp.\u2019s PlayStation and Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch, Spencer is pleased with the results. Microsoft will do more of that, he said, and won\u2019t rule out any game in Microsoft\u2019s stable.\n\u201cI do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say \u2018thou must not,\u2019 \u201d he said. It\u2019s too early to make any sort of decision on the next version of Halo, he said.\nFollowing the Activision acquisition, Xbox cut more than 2,500 jobs and closed three game-design studios. With the company exiting what management calls a difficult year amid a challenging mobile-game market, Spencer feels good about 2025.\n\u201cThe Xbox business has never been more healthy,\u201d he said, citing growth in cloud and PC gaming as well as console usage. \u201cThe business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build.\u201d\nSpencer also said he\u2019s optimistic about the growth of mobile games.\n\u201cI feel pretty good about where this industry is going,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cTo reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We\u2019re not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles.\u201d\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nA Guide to Trump\u2019s Tariff Plans: Expect High Drama and a Bumpy Rollout\nNorth Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\nOh, the Irony.

The world will likely need to take billions of tons of CO2 from the air per year by mid-century, yet current capacity is just a fraction of that. A wave of startups is attempting to address that using a range of techniques, including deploying machines that perform what\u2019s known as direct air capture (DAC).\n\u201cWe need to prove that this stuff works. We need to prove that we can actually build the projects we say we're going to build, and we actually have to deliver credits to the customers who have, over the last couple of years, been making commitments to future supply,\u201d said Damien Steel, chief executive officer of Deep Sky. \u201cIf that supply doesn't start showing up soon, we as a market are in big trouble.\u201d\nMicrosoft and RBC agreed to purchase 10,000 tons of CO2 removal services over a 10-year period from Deep Sky, a Canadian project developer with a distinct approach to carbon removal: the company is convening multiple technologies at the same site, powered by a single energy source and funneling CO2 to the same storage well. Deep Sky is building a facility in Alberta that, upon completion, is expected to house eight DAC units, each designed and built by a different startup.\nCo-founder Fred Lalonde, who is also the co-founder and chief executive officer of Canadian travel company and unicorn startup Hopper Inc., said he wasn\u2019t going to \u201csit here and watch the world burn.\u201d\nCentralizing different startups\u2019 DAC units in a single location will help reduce overhead and increase the pace of innovation, said Lalonde. It\u2019s also expected to help free them from the headache of permitting for CO2 storage and purchasing clean energy to power the machines pulling carbon from the air \u2014 a task becoming increasingly hard amid the AI data center boom.\n\u201cThey can go through innovation cycles on a rapid basis across a very large, diverse technology set to push down costs, timeline to deployment and overall scale potential,\u201d said Brian Marrs, Microsoft\u2019s senior director of energy and carbon removal, who called Deep Sky a \u201cplayground for direct air capture.\u201d\nStory Continues\nDedicated corporate buyers with hard-to-reach net zero goals and deep pockets have poured millions into helping these startups grow, with Microsoft a particular leader. The tech giant has targeted being carbon-negative by 2030 yet its emissions have risen more than 40% since 2020, driven in part by an AI push that has put its climate targets at risk.\nDeep Sky expects its Alberta facility to be operational by the end of March and to be delivering credits to customers by June. With a 3,000-ton-per-year capacity, it\u2019s small but will prove to buyers and investors that the technology works, according to vice president of carbon markets Charlie Renzoni. Deep Sky is also working on building three much larger commercial sites throughout Canada, all of which have initial allocations of renewable power from their local utilities.\nCarbon removal is a growing part of corporate decarbonization strategies, particularly for companies seeking higher-quality carbon credits amid a flawed market. Yet the Deep Sky deal is a tiny fraction of Microsoft\u2019s overall carbon removal portfolio, which includes millions of tons purchased from projects including bioenergy and carbon capture from Stockholm Exergi and Orsted A/S and direct air capture from 1PointFive and Heirloom Carbon Technologies. This marks RBC\u2019s first DAC purchase.\nSteel thinks that within the next 15 years, pressure for corporations and governments to cut emissions will become impossible to ignore. \u201cWhat we're trying to do at Deep Sky is invest and get ourselves as far along the innovation curve as possible so that when we inevitably reach a point where we don't have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe actually have a solution that can scale.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nA Guide to Trump\u2019s Tariff Plans: Expect High Drama and a Bumpy Rollout\nOh, the Irony.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD has staged an impressive comeback, with shares rallying 34% over the past three months. This surge follows the significant dip in its share price triggered by the global IT outage on July 19, 2024.\nCRWD stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry and the S&P 500 index\u2019s rise of 16.2% and 10%, respectively, in the past three months. It has also fared better than other cybersecurity players, including Palo Alto Networks PANW, CyberArk Software CYBR and Check Point Software CHKP. Shares of Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk Software have soared 17.1% and 9.1%, respectively, while Check Point Software stock has declined 3.4% during the same time frame.\n3-Month Price Return Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis outperformance has made investors wonder if this is the right time to buy or hold CRWD stock and wait for more stability. Here\u2019s why maintaining a hold strategy could be the most prudent move.\nResilience in CRWD\u2019s Financial Performance Post Outage\nCrowdStrike\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company\u2019s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.\nThe company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm\u2019s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.\nThis robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike\u2019s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company\u2019s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation\nCrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.\nThe Falcon platform\u2019s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike\u2019s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Market Position and Customer Loyalty\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm\u2019s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.\nMoreover, the company's \u201cFalcon Flex\u201d subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.\nNavigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike\nDespite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company\u2019s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management\u2019s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.\nAnalysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPotential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike\u2019s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern\nCrowdStrike\u2019s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry\u2019s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now\nWhile CrowdStrike\u2019s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.29%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.86%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.09%.\nThe cloud-based security company's stock has climbed by 10.27% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.3%.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of CrowdStrike Holdings in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on November 26, 2024. On that day, CrowdStrike Holdings is projected to report earnings of $0.82 per share, which would represent no growth from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $982.26 million, indicating a 24.97% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion. These totals would mark changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nEarlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike\u2019s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn\u2019t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon\u2019s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.\nClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 6th on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.\nIs Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?\nOn November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.\nNow that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined\u00a0Catalysts\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.\nMcLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.\nMcLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to \u201cswitch course.\u201d\nOn the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined\u00a0Wealth!\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.\nDatta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.\nHe suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to \u201cpivot away\u201d from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.\nStory Continues\nAs the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.\nIn the last 5 years CrowdStrike Holdings saw its revenue grow at 39% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Fortunately, the market has not missed this, and has pushed the share price up by 41% per year in that time. Despite the strong run, top performers like CrowdStrike Holdings have been known to go on winning for decades. On the face of it, this looks lke a good opportunity, although we note sentiment seems very positive already.\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nCrowdStrike Holdings is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts\nA Different Perspective\nIt's nice to see that CrowdStrike Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 68% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 41%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand CrowdStrike Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with CrowdStrike Holdings .\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's current watchlist.\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on stocks that could perform well regardless of who ends up running the White House. On Tuesday, Cramer observed that the day\u2019s market performance gave the impression that every stock could go higher no matter who secures the presidency.\nHe pointed to significant gains across various sectors, including aerospace, housing, retail, and healthcare. Cramer noted that this broad-based rally resulted in strong performances on Tuesday, with the Dow climbing 427 points, the S&P rising by 1.23%, and the NASDAQ soaring by 1.43%. However, he tempered his optimism by adding that days like Tuesday might prove to be outliers in the coming weeks.\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks\nCramer took the opportunity to highlight ten stocks he believes will thrive and said:\n\u201cI want to highlight ten stocks that I believe will do well under either candidate, a who\u2019s who of acclamation, companies that almost have to do well because of seismic trends and savvy managements. Companies that no White House would get hung up on, either because they\u2019re beneath notice or they\u2019re perceived as good corporate citizens by both sides. Stocks in industries that neither Trump nor Harris have ever targeted in the past.\u201d\nHe also raised an important question for the viewers: \u201cIf you had the results of the election in hand, would you really know what to buy or sell?\u201d According to Cramer, answering that question is far more complicated than it seems. He emphasized his list of stocks that can thrive regardless of the election outcome. These are companies that have no clear political adversaries in Washington, making them relatively safe bets. Cramer acknowledged, however, that many stocks that seem like obvious picks for one candidate or another often have hidden dynamics that don\u2019t get enough attention.\n\u201cIn the end, this presidential prognostication game is meaningless until we start hearing about cabinet appointments, those will tell us a lot. Then, we can figure out really who the winners and losers are. Right now, though, there are just too many political angles to every single stock story.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 5. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCramer said that he is a\u00a0 big believer of cybersecurity, which is why his trust owns CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock.\n\u201cHey, speaking of hating to lose the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, that's Desh Aurora, and the CEO of CrowdStrike, that's George Kurtz, are both extremely competitive. They know how to stop cybercrime better than anyone. I know it hurts our diversification efforts, but the Charitable Trust owns both these stocks because I'm a huge believer in cybersecurity and I'm not gonna be left behind by a great stock here. There's so much crime happening online. These companies literally can't handle all the business. Imagine that, I call that a high-quality problem.\u201d\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) offers cybersecurity solutions. It is known for its Falcon platform, a comprehensive suite of endpoint security solutions. Despite facing challenges earlier this year due to an outage that temporarily impacted its reputation, the company continues to be regarded as a top player in its field. During the fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings call, which ended on July 31, CEO George Kurtz acknowledged that the outage caused some prospective customers to delay signing contracts.\nHowever, he emphasized that most of these deals remain active in the sales pipeline, indicating that the company\u2019s position in the market is still strong. Its Falcon platform offers a wide range of security tools, with 28 modules available to customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, 65% of its customers were using at least five of these modules. The number of deals involving eight or more modules saw a significant increase, up 66% compared to the same period last year.\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) uses generative AI to detect threats and respond to potential breaches more rapidly. The company claims to have \"the industry's most complete AI-native defense,\" positioning its technology as highly advanced. Its AI models are trained on data from more than 2 trillion incidents every day, enabling them to continually improve in terms of both speed and accuracy. This sophisticated approach to threat detection is central to the company\u2019s value proposition and has helped maintain its reputation as a leader in endpoint security.\nOverall CRWD ranks 5th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks that can do well regardless of who wins. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news.\nCNBC\u2019s Deidre Bosa joined \u2018Money Movers\u2019 to discuss the potential impact of a second Trump administration on the artificial intelligence trade. Bosa notes that artificial intelligence could be \u201cless regulated\u201d and \u201cmore volatile\u201d under Trump's leadership. However, the president-elect\u2019s AI policy could be a boon to the industry itself, albeit at the expense of necessary guardrails for AI. Back in June, Republicans adopted a new party platform containing a provision related to scrapping Biden\u2019s executive orders on AI.\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss and\u00a015 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nBiden\u2019s executive orders sought to tackle new technology threats by requiring developers of powerful AI systems to share their safety test results with the US government and also called on federal agencies to develop guidelines for the responsible use of AI domains. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s allies have been proposing a different executive order that would launch a series of \u201cManhattan Projects\u201d for developing military technology and immediately review \u201cunnecessary and burdensome regulations\u201d to \u201cMake America Great in AI\u201d.\nTrump, however, seems to be only one of the few who thinks imposing guardrails on artificial intelligence could prove detrimental to the US. A poll shared with Time reveals that Americans across the political spectrum are skeptical about the idea that the U.S. should avoid regulating AI to outcompete China. According to a poll by the AI Policy Institute (AIPI), 75% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans believe that \u201ctaking a careful controlled approach\u201d to AI is preferable as opposed to \u201cmoving forward on AI as fast as possible to be the first country to get extremely powerful AI.\u201d\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAmid the ongoing debate, recent developments in AI are rapidly shaping the landscape in the backdrop. For instance, Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine, is said to be raising new investment that would value the search startup to a staggering $9 billion. The new funding round is set to raise $500 million led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which also holds a board seat in the startup.\nIn other news, OpenAI, an AI research lab and company, has acquired Chat.com, further adding to its collection of high-profile domain names. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the acquisition via email. While such AI-related news is often striking, AI capabilities continue to surprise even the most seasoned experts. In fact, AI can now even help you become a better parent. On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz's partner Justine Moore took to X to share an investment idea, advocating for \"a new wave of 'parenting co-pilots' powered by LLMs and agents. She highlighted companies such as Cradlewise, creators of an AI-driven baby monitor that tracks sleep patterns and rocks the crib, and Nanit, which utilizes AI to analyze crib footage and monitor a baby's breathing.\nStory Continues\n\u201cImagine an AI parenting companion that\u2019s always in your corner \u2013 ready to answer questions or talk about how you\u2019re feeling at any time of the day (or night)\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

With this acquisition, CrowdStrike will be the only cybersecurity vendor to provide unified, end-to-end protection against identity-based attacks across the entire modern cloud ecosystem \u2013 from on-premises Active Directory to cloud-based identity providers and SaaS applications \u2013 delivered from a single, unified platform. Announced at Fal.Con Europe, CrowdStrike\u2019s inaugural premier user conference in the region, this acquisition will position CrowdStrike as the leading provider of comprehensive protection across complex hybrid environments.\n\"CrowdStrike was built to tackle the toughest cybersecurity challenges, and we drive relentless innovation based on what our customers need to stay ahead of modern threats,\" said George Kurtz, CEO and founder, CrowdStrike. \"As SaaS and AI adoption grows, every new application brings additional complexity and the risk of misconfigurations across human and non-human accounts that create openings for sophisticated attacks. With the acquisition of Adaptive Shield, CrowdStrike will continue to set the standard for identity-based protection in the cloud, delivering best-in-class SaaS protection from the Falcon platform.\"\nIdentity-Based Attacks in the Cloud Target SaaS Applications\nCloud exploitation cases grew by 110% last year, while identity-based attacks continue to rise \u2013 75% of attacks to gain initial access are now malware-free. \u2018Cross-domain\u2019 adversaries, targeting identity and cloud, have numerous attack paths, from on-premises Active Directory to cloud-based identity providers and the growing landscape of SaaS applications. The complexity of modern hybrid cloud environments and disconnected security tools create protection gaps, making it difficult to prevent identity-based threats. SaaS is projected to be the largest category of cloud computing in 2024, capturing more than 40% of all public cloud spending1. Under the SaaS shared responsibility model, SaaS vendors provide security controls, while organizations manage configurations. In today\u2019s complex environments, where hundreds of SaaS applications each come with unique access controls and identity configurations, security teams face significant challenges in maintaining visibility into who has access, what sensitive data is exposed, and active threats \u2013 even with purpose-built SaaS protection.\nStory Continues\nAdaptive Shield and the Falcon Platform \u2013 Comprehensive Identity and SaaS Security\nAdaptive Shield delivers the industry\u2019s most complete security posture management and threat protection across SaaS identities, misconfigurations and data, stopping SaaS breaches. As an integrated component of the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae cybersecurity platform, Adaptive Shield will equip CrowdStrike with the most advanced capabilities to stop identity-based attacks across all aspects of modern hybrid cloud environments. Customer benefits will include:\nComprehensive SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM): Organizations gain full visibility and governance over misconfigurations, the entitlements and activity levels of both human and non-human identities, and exposed data across 150+ SaaS applications. This new end-to-end visibility of identities across hybrid cloud environments gives operators unique context for rapid cloud detection and response (CDR).\nGenAI Application Security Control: By continuously monitoring GenAI SaaS applications, Adaptive Shield empowers organizations to enforce consistent security standards by detecting configuration shifts, controlling AI settings to prevent data leakage, and identifying shadow AI applications to revoke access based on their risk profile. This approach ensures that AI-integrated applications remain aligned with security policies to protect sensitive data.\nUnified Hybrid Identity and Cloud Security: The powerful combination of Adaptive Shield and CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Identity Protection will provide customers with comprehensive identity protection across SaaS, on-premises Active Directory and cloud-based environments (Okta and Microsoft Entra ID). CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Cloud Security customers will also gain unified visibility and protection across the entire modern cloud estate \u2013 infrastructure, custom applications, data, AI models and SaaS applications \u2013 all from the same unified console and workflow.\nExisting Integration Accelerates Detection and Response: Adaptive Shield\u2019s existing integration with CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen SIEM provides rapid first-party detection and response across multiple security domains \u2013 endpoints, identities, workloads and applications \u2013 automatically correlating detections inline with the latest threat intelligence and Falcon Fusion SOAR delivering near real-time response.\n\"Widespread adoption of SaaS applications has rapidly expanded the enterprise attack surface, as shared responsibility models and fragmented security controls make SaaS environments a prime target,\" said Maor Bin, CEO and co-founder, Adaptive Shield. \"Our mission perfectly complements CrowdStrike, stopping SaaS breaches while further accelerating consolidation on cybersecurity's most comprehensive platform. I'm incredibly proud of our team for building the most advanced SaaS security solution, defining the market.\"\nTo learn more about Adaptive Shield and CrowdStrike, please visit here.\nTransaction Details\nThe purchase price is contemplated to be paid predominantly in cash and includes a portion to be delivered in the form of stock subject to vesting conditions.

According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the \u201cCNBC Connect\u201d event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI\u2019s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology.\n\u201cThree years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you\u201d.\nREAD ALSO: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 8 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now\nLatest Developments in AI\nLet\u2019s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported.\nIn other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation\u2019s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC\u2019s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation.\nStory Continues\nSpeaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training\u2014the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures\u2014have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring \u201ctest-time compute,\u201d a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called \u201cinference\u201d phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia\u2019s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc.

It designs chips for companies that are building AI data centers.\nOn November 7, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis reaffirmed his \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), citing surging demand for AI chips that will last \u201cseveral years\u201d to benefit the technology company. According to Curtis, the AI accelerator market will grow by 58% a year from $47 billion in 2023 to $287 billion in 2027. Moreover, there isn\u2019t a sign of a CapEx spending slowdown from the major technology companies as well. While Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s chip business is largely driven by Google, other companies are also likely to use it in a significant manner in the years to come.\n\u201cWe see the most near-term upside at Marvell and Nvidia, but do expect outperformance from Broadcom later in 2025\u201d.\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks that should not be ignored. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 69.19%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology powerhouse known for its expertise in semiconductor design, development, and supply, alongside its enterprise software and security solutions. The company\u2019s cybersecurity portfolio includes a range of products, such as its Symantec Enterprise Cloud platform, as well as solutions for payment, mainframe, network, endpoint, and identity security.\nIn the third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, marking a 47% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and solid non-AI semiconductor performance. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects its AI revenue to rise 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the total for the year to $12 billion, primarily fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOn November 5, BofA reaffirmed its Buy rating on AVGO, citing the company's leadership in AI computing and networking, along with its strong free cash flow. However, the bank lowered its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast due to seasonal challenges, particularly stemming from a product transition with Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) that is expected to affect revenue in the first half of the year. Still, Broadcom\u2019s position is expected to be buoyed by new AI and networking contracts, along with further opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to adjusted earnings per share of $7.31 by 2026. As AI adoption continues to grow, Broadcom\u2019s focus on high-performance AI networking solutions, especially in complement to NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell architecture, could potentially strengthen its future prospects.\nOverall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Curtis has assigned Buy ratings to each of these companies.\nJensen Huang-led Nvidia is experiencing extraordinary demand that surpasses its rapidly growing capacity, Curtis noted. Major tech firms are increasing their investments in GPUs and internal ASIC programs, he added.

He sees no slowdown in capital expenditure from tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta.\nMarvell and Nvidia are expected to see the most immediate gains, with Broadcom likely to outperform later in 2025. Currently, Broadcom\u2019s AI chip business is largely driven by Google by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), but Curtis anticipates broader adoption in the coming years. Rep.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of UBS\u2019 Top Quant Stocks In AI, IT, Healthcare & Other Sectors: Top 33 Stocks In All Sectors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other UBS\u2019 top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors.\nWith the third quarter of the 2024 earnings season underway, Wall Street is dealing with a changing stock market environment. The Federal Reserve has started its interest rate reduction cycle and market watchers are on the lookout for labor market and inflationary indicators to determine whether the Fed will be able to meet its goal of reducing interest rates by an additional 50 basis points by the end of this year.\nSimultaneously, the shifting economic climate is also creating changes in the investment environment. High interest rates traditionally do not mean well for certain stock market sectors barring exceptional circumstances. Some sectors that don\u2019t perform well in a high-rate environment include real estate, healthcare, and technology.\nFor two of these, this has been the case in the 2022 \u2013 2024 Federal Reserve interest rate hiking cycle as well. Starting from real estate, the flagship S&P index\u2019s real estate sector\u2019s annualized three-year return is currently -2.66%. From its peak of 324.75 in December 2021, the index has lost 48.2 points or 14.8%. Similarly, the high-end healthcare and biotechnology sector does not fare well during high interest rates either. Since 2021\u2019s close, the S&P\u2019s pharmaceutical stock index is down by -0.84% while the S&P\u2019s biotechnology index has lost a sizable 12.61%.\nThis brings us to our third stock market sector, a.k.a, technology. Technology, as you\u2019re likely aware, has seen a lot of investor interest due to the surge in artificial intelligence. Looking at the performance of the S&P\u2019s technology stock index, its performance also mirrors real estate and healthcare stocks before the frenzy around artificial intelligence started. Between 2021\u2019s close and the market\u2019s bottom in October 2022, the index had lost 33%. During the same time period, the real estate, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology stock indexes had lost 34.8%, 12.2%, and 30.5%, respectively. However, market optimism surrounding artificial intelligence has created a clear bifurcation in performance.\nAs an example, while real estate stocks have gained 29% since the October 2022 bottom and biotechnology stocks have added 25% in value, information technology stocks are up by a whopping 115%. This shows that tech stocks have delivered 4x the returns of both real estate and biotechnology. Driving this is artificial intelligence, with the shares of the world\u2019s premier AI GPU designer up by\u00a0690%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nStory Continues\nLooking at these shifts, the next question to ask is which stock market sectors might benefit from the evolving environment moving forward. On this front, investment bank UBS has some insights. In its Equity Compass Report issued in mid-October, the bank identifies key themes and trends for US and global stock markets. Within global and US stock market sectors, the bank has rated only one sector as \u2018Most Attractive\u2019. Unsurprisingly, this is the US technology sector which is currently experiencing a sustained surge of investor optimism courtesy of artificial intelligence.\nThe bank shares several data points to justify its optimism in the US technology sector, and more specifically, artificial intelligence companies. Citing data from the Hugging Face repository, a collection of software development tools, it reveals \u201can average 200% y/y rise for new AI models and model downloads combined so far in 2024.\u201d UBS is also optimistic about the growing adoption of artificial intelligence in the US business world. AI adoption is key since big technology firms that have invested billions of dollars in AI need it to generate returns on their investment.\nAs per UBS, data from the Census Bureau\u2019s Business Trends and Outlook (BTOS) survey released in September 2024 shows that AI adoption across the 1.2 million firms tracked was picking up the pace. \u201cIn the survey, 5.9% of companies reported using AI as of 3Q24, up from 3.7% in 3Q23,\u201d outlined the bank in its report. Not only did 5.9% of the firms adopt AI, but the survey\u2019s outlook for the next six months revealed that AI adoption across the surveyed population could rise by 2.8 percentage points to sit at 8.7%. Commenting on the implications of the higher adoption, UBS stated that \u201cincreasing future adoption will increase visibility on AI monetization, which is consistent with recent comments from leading cloud platforms.\u201d The firms slated to benefit the most from this monetization are those \u201d with strong footprints in existing customer bases,\u201d believes the bank.\nThese statements necessitate asking the question of\u00a0which\u00a0industries are slated to benefit the most from AI adoption. Fortunately for us, UBS also shares data for the industries currently leading the way with AI adoption and those that could grow adoption in the future. Right now, the information technology and personal services sectors are leading with AI adoption since as of September 2024, their respective adoption percentages were 19.1% and 14.7%. For the next six months, while the same industries are expected to lead the pack in overall AI adoption through their 23% and 19.8% percentages, others are expected to make higher percentage point gains. Two industries that stand out in the report are educational services and the finance and insurance industries.\nAs per the report, the former is expected to increase its AI adoption by 5.6 percentage points to 18.7% over the next six months from the current value of 13.1%. For the finance and insurance sector, it is expected to mark a 6.2 percentage point jump to 13.4% from the existing AI adoption of 7.2%. Of course, while AI is by far the most popular sector in the market right now, UBS also shares other attractive areas. It outlines that the market \u201calso offers exposure to secular growth in longevity through various US medical device companies. Many US companies are also playing leading roles in the energy transition via electric vehicles, renewables, and energy efficiency.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of UBS stocks with improving quantitative indicators, we chose the firm\u2019s top stocks that are seeing improvements in EPS growth, P/E ratio, and other indicators. Stocks within each sector were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. The sectors themselves were ranked by the cumulative number of funds invested in the firms.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc (AVGO): AI Growth with Custom Chips and VMWare Boost\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 130\nSector: Information Technology\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. The firm operates in the hardware and software industries. Its key strengths lie on the former front, with Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) responsible for providing networking and custom chips for a wide variety of use cases. These provide the firm with large customers like Apple and have enabled it to establish a foothold in the AI industry. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) benefits from AI through its custom chips, and word on the street is that the firm has partnered up with OpenAI to develop a custom chip. Yet, reliance on customers like Apple is a double-edged sword as it also exposes Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to revenue losses in case its customers decide to develop custom chips. On the software front, the firm\u2019s VMWare acquisition has enabled it to sizably grow its revenue and could lead to further tailwinds in the future.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc.\u00a0is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of UBS\u2019 top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher.\nKen Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory.\nUnder Fisher\u2019s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times\u2019 list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis\nUnderstanding Bull Markets and the Role of Technology in Investment Strategies\nKen Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm\u2019s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic.\nFisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns.\nKen Fisher Predicts Shift as Value Stocks Begin to Outperform Growth Amid Fed Rate Speculations\nKen Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cAs 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn\u2019t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that\u2019s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.\u201d\nAdditionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources.\nAs short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year.\nOur Methodology\nThis article explores the top ten stock holdings of Fisher Asset Management, based on 13F filings as of Q2 2024. The stocks are arranged in ascending order according to the stake of Fisher Asset Management, as of June 30, 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.\nIs Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?\nOn November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.\nNow that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined\u00a0Catalysts\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.\nMcLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.\nMcLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to \u201cswitch course.\u201d\nOn the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined\u00a0Wealth!\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.\nDatta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.\nHe suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to \u201cpivot away\u201d from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.\nStory Continues\nAs the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\nThe company has been performing exceptionally throughout the year, having launched breakthrough technologies that facilitate the management of large datasets for AI tasks and scalable AI systems. Fast forward to November 5th, the company unveiled VeloRAIN, a platform that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the performance of AI security workloads. On the same day, the company\u2019s VMware Cloud Foundation unveiled a private cloud platform to improve customers\u2019 AI autonomy and security.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially to $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion, driven by ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers. Overall, consolidated revenue and net income grew by 47% and 44%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024, driven by growing AI revenue and VMware bookings.\nBroadcom Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as it leverages artificial intelligence.

We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 5th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nThe Calculation\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$29.8b\nUS$35.2b\nUS$40.8b\nUS$44.1b\nUS$46.7b\nUS$49.0b\nUS$51.1b\nUS$53.0b\nUS$54.8b\nUS$56.5b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x13\nAnalyst x8\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ 5.85%\nEst @ 4.88%\nEst @ 4.20%\nEst @ 3.73%\nEst @ 3.39%\nEst @ 3.16%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3%\nUS$27.5k\nUS$30.0k\nUS$32.1k\nUS$32.1k\nUS$31.4k\nUS$30.4k\nUS$29.2k\nUS$28.0k\nUS$26.7k\nUS$25.5k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$293b\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$56b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (8.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$1.0t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.0t\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$460b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$753b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$184, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\ndcf\nImportant Assumptions\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Broadcom as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.378. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for Broadcom\nStrength\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.\nThreat\nDividends are not covered by earnings.\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nNext Steps:\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other hot growth stocks.\nA month before the election that spelled Donald Trump's victory, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report showing a robust labor market with rising wages, a decrease in unemployment, and the addition of 254,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in September, down from 4.2% in August and 4.3% in July. Earlier concerns arose when the unemployment rate increased, leading some economists to worry that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to cut interest rates impacted the labor market.\nHowever, the Fed eased those concerns in September by cutting the federal funds rate by half a percentage point. The Fed had initially raised rates aggressively beginning in March 2022 to combat inflation, pausing mid-2023. While inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in June 2022, economists note the high rates continue to impact the economy, especially the housing market. That said, Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the housing market on September 30, noting that he expects housing inflation to keep easing and that overall economic conditions are conducive to further disinflation.\nOn another note, while September's Consumer and Producer Price Indexes aligned with expectations, signaling that inflation is trending toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target, economists at Goldman believe the Fed may have already reached that goal. The investment bank forecasts that the Commerce Department's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for September will show a 12-month inflation rate of 2.04%. If accurate, this figure would be rounded down to 2%, aligning perfectly with the Fed's long-standing objective. This would come just over two years after inflation surged to a 40-year high, prompting a series of aggressive interest rate hikes. Moreover, the S&P 500 has gained 4% since the Fed's rate initial cut last month, as investors have poured over $20 billion into U.S. stock funds.\nBoth Fundstrat and Goldman raised their year-end stock market forecasts in week 41 of this year, with Goldman predicting an additional 2% rise after the S&P 500 exceeded its previous target. This would cap off an already strong year, with the index up more than 20%. A key driver behind the forecasts for continued stock price growth is the expectation that a broader range of industries will contribute to the market's rise. However, in reality, indexes like the S&P 500 remain largely dependent on investor enthusiasm for tech, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence. On that note, the bank also pointed to a recovering microchip supply chain, which is expected to lift profits for both chipmakers and tech giants as they develop new AI applications.\nStory Continues\nWhile historical performance isn\u2019t always a reliable indicator, seasonal trends suggest that Q4 often boosts the broader U.S. markets, partly driven by increased consumer spending during the holiday season. Market analysts also note that growth stocks tend to perform well when global interest rates reverse course. However, Adam Parker, CEO of Trivariate Research, shared in an interview with CNBC that he feels more pessimistic about growth stocks compared to his outlook before August 5 lows, citing the unusual market conditions and a slight dip in corporate earnings growth projections.\nMoreover, despite high expectations that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve would boost the stock market, this hasn\u2019t materialized as anticipated. Investors seem to be increasingly sensitive to growth concerns amid a global landscape marked by the U.S. presidential election, Middle East instability, and an uncertain Fed rate outlook for next year. While the Fed has hinted at more rate cuts, moving too quickly could jeopardize inflation goals. Regarding this, analysts at Stifel made the following remarks:\n\"The conclusion \u2026 is that if the Fed cuts rates in 2025 absent a recession (two 25's as this year comes to a close do not count) then that would be a mistake, with investors paying the price in latter 2025 / 2026, based on historical precedent.\"\nIn terms of making money in the stock market, most investors are naturally drawn to growth stocks. While defensive investments are gaining traction due to global economic slowdown, Andrew Slimmon of Morgan Stanley Investment Management advises against this approach. These sentiments emphasize that high-growth stocks can outperform the market and deliver strong returns even if the stock fluctuates during the short term. Many of these stocks have shown impressive revenue growth and, with key catalysts in place, may continue to outperform.\nAdditionally, hedge funds see the most promising growth stocks as those positioned to benefit from rising consumer purchasing power. As the Fed aims for a soft economic landing, consumer cyclical stocks may gain, bolstered by improved consumer spending. Rate cuts should also support growth and tech stocks, setting the stage for potential gains across these sectors. In that same vein, the average annual return for the 500 largest-cap companies has consistently exceeded 10%, giving investors strong confidence to favor the stock market over more conservative options like bonds or fixed-income securities.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we compiled a list of the top growth stocks with year-to-date gains exceeding 20%. These hot stocks to buy are ranked in ascending order based on hedge fund sentiment, offering a clear view of which growth stocks are most favored by institutional investors.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nYear-To-Date Gain as of November 6: 55.63%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global leader in technology, specializing in semiconductor design and enterprise software. The company's product lineup includes cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters, catering to diverse markets such as data centers, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless.\nBofA Securities reaffirmed its Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a price target of $215, following a meeting at Broadcom\u2019s headquarters attended by CEO Hock Tan, CFO Kirsten Spears, and IR head Ji Yoo, which saw strong investor interest. The discussion focused on Broadcom\u2019s growing presence in the artificial intelligence market. The company expects AI-related sales to contribute roughly $12 billion, or 24% of its total revenue, in fiscal year 2024. This growth comes from a total addressable market (TAM) projected between $100 billion and $125 billion, driven by increasing AI workload demands.\nIn the third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, reflecting a 47% increase year-over-year. This growth was fueled by robust AI-related revenue, strong VMware bookings, and stable non-AI semiconductor sales. For Q4 2024, Broadcom anticipates a 10% sequential increase in AI revenue to $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion, primarily driven by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the hot growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow Customer Service Management and Five9 Intelligent CX Platform to streamline self-service and assisted service operations\nIntegrated solution to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction\nTORONTO & BARCELONA, Spain, November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow World Forum & Five9 CX Summit\u2014ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, and Five9 (NASDAQ: FIVN), provider of the Intelligent CX Platform, today announced an expanded partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified end-to-end employee and customer experiences. By combining the strengths of ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) and the Five9 platform, the solution will create more streamlined self-service and assisted service operations and unify customer support processes to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and simplify contact center operations.\n\"Organizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together,\" said John Ball, senior vice president, Customer and Industry Workflows at ServiceNow. \"ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self-service and assisted service across voice and digital channels. Our expanded partnership with Five9 takes this even further, combining the best of both platforms to streamline and unify contact center operations with a turnkey solution that\u2019s fast to deploy and delivers fast ROI.\"\n\"Five9\u2019s longstanding partnership with ServiceNow has been rooted in the joint mission to create seamless and powerful end-to-end customer experiences,\" said Callan Schebella, executive vice president, product management, Five9. \"This next phase of our partnership transforms the approach to customer experience management, alleviating a lot of the frustrations that come with using multiple systems to address customer needs. We\u2019ve taken a big step forward to empower customers with our joint AI capabilities and improved interface functionality, easing the day-to-day challenges of customer-facing service.\"\n\"Combining the most valuable features into a unified interface can transform the way we support our customers,\" said Bob Massengill, senior director, Technology Infrastructure, Pilot Travel Centers, LLC. \"This new ServiceNow-Five9 joint solution has the potential to enable us to address customer needs more quickly and effectively.\"\nStory Continues\nThe new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.\nReal-time Transcription \u2013 Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents\u2019 work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.\nUnified Routing \u2013 Five9\u2019s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9. This reduces operational overhead for managers through streamlined routing management across both systems, making it easier to adjust staffing during high-demand periods. It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.\nSingle Agent Experience \u2013 Native Call Controls within ServiceNow\u2019s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer\u2019s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.\nAvailability\nThe ServiceNow and Five9 integrated capabilities are expected to be available to select customers in the first half of 2025.\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

          "whole_article": "(Photo: Business Wire)\nNew Now Assist capabilities drive greater visibility and controls with AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices\nNative multilingual support extends global footprint for seamless, culturally aware GenAI communications and translations\nPurpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, today announced new generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to advance autonomous, responsible AI on the Now Platform. With this launch, ServiceNow is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio for customers. This includes new, expanded Now Assist capabilities that drive greater visibility and controls with an AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices. Native multilingual support in Now Assist extends GenAI\u2019s global footprint for seamless, culturally aware communications and translations. Finally, purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety.\nAs enterprises have accelerated the adoption of GenAI, they are discovering that siloed applications and scattered data are barriers to impact and that establishing clearly defined, human-centric governance processes are essential to the effective use and oversight of GenAI. That\u2019s why ServiceNow delivers a winning combination of one platform with an integrated data layer and continues to optimize its AI platform for speed, scale, and security. The single architecture of the Now Platform helps ensure strong governance is embedded in its Now Assist GenAI solutions, models, and agents no matter where they are deployed in an organization.\n\"Enterprises across every industry are embracing a future of greater autonomy and productivity, all in service to their employees, customers, and overall business impact,\" said Jon Sigler, senior vice president of Platform and AI at ServiceNow. \"The ServiceNow platform was built to empower this transformation, offering smarter, faster ways of working through AI-enabled automation. With governance at the core, these new innovations bring more personalized, collaborative, trusted experiences to life across the enterprise.\"\nElevating customer trust with integrated AI governance\nTeams working with AI are often burdened with siloed tools and systems, making visibility and AI governance difficult. AI governance requires the integration of complex business processes and needs a best-of-breed workflow platform to be implemented successfully. With a unified AI inventory data model for connecting AI strategy, technology, security, and compliance to operate as an AI control tower, and expanded oversight for AI Governance for Now Assist, ServiceNow is laying a foundation to help customers build trust while accelerating business transformation.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also introduced new Now Assist capabilities that empower customers with the tools needed for responsible AI use:\nNow Assist Guardian provides built-in monitoring and responsible AI guardrails so customers can better control the use of GenAI on the Now Platform. This includes the management and mitigation of offensive content, security vulnerabilities, and the exposure of sensitive information.\nNow Assist Data Kit eases the often-cumbersome task of managing and consuming data for AI use cases. Users can create and easily manage datasets for AI skills and applications, develop ground truth datasets to benchmark for accuracy and help predict AI outcomes, and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of experiences built with Now Assist Skill Kit.\nNow Assist Analytics offers greater visibility into the adoption, usage, and performance of Now Assist across the enterprise. With these insights, customers can make more informed, data-driven decisions to advance GenAI adoption, evaluate ROI on GenAI investments, and enable better business outcomes.\nExtending the value and impact of GenAI globally\nWith today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow is adding new built-in multilingual features to Now Assist. These new features address customer demand and expand the application of ServiceNow\u2019s GenAI solutions in global markets. Now Assist can now generate, summarize, and respond to GenAI prompts in the user\u2019s native language, providing improved, culturally aware understanding and communication for both agents and requestors.\nThe following languages are supported natively by Now Assist: English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese. Other languages will continue to be supported with ServiceNow\u2019s existing Dynamic Translation, which automatically translates user inputs and a response back in the user\u2019s language.\nAccelerating productivity with tailored Now Assist solutions\nBuilding on the Xanadu platform release\u2014which marked the company\u2019s most comprehensive set of AI innovations to date\u2014ServiceNow has further expanded Now Assist solutions, purpose-built for specific enterprise use cases. From configuration management to legal affairs and health and safety, GenAI can help transform the productivity and efficacy of these critical internal functions.\nNow Assist for Configuration Management Database (CMDB) uses AI to make managing and understanding data easier for customers. It helps users keep a clean and accurate CMDB by reducing duplicate data, simplifying complex information, and streamlining data input. With Now Assist for CMDB, users can quickly view summaries of Configuration Items (CIs) and their dependencies, and AI can find and fix duplicate data automatically. It also assists in the setup of Service Graph Connectors to bring data into the CMDB and fix any issues that come up during the process.\nNow Assist for Legal Service Delivery helps legal teams deliver faster service to clients with auto-generated summaries of legal requests and matters. Legal teams are often juggling multiple requests and complex legal matters, such as investigations, simultaneously. With Now Assist, they can fulfill these requests with greater efficiency and faster time to resolution.\nNow Assist in Contract Management streamlines contract processing and reduces risk by leveraging GenAI to automatically flag non-standard language, identify missing clauses and suggest revisions within contracts such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Additionally, GenAI provides rapid insights into contractual terms and obligations by intelligently extracting metadata from contracts. This helps reduce cost, revenue leakage, and risk for the enterprise.\nNow Assist for Health and Safety helps ensure a safer environment for employees by streamlining incident management processes while reducing manual, repetitive work for health and safety workers. It uses GenAI to auto-generate summaries of safety incidents and lessons learned based on incident records, resulting in more effective communication, improved agent productivity, and proactive prevention and resolution of incidents.\nIn addition to these new innovations, ServiceNow Impact\u2014the ServiceNow customer success solution to maximize AI, optimize performance, provide on-demand expertise, and accelerate business value\u2014includes new GenAI accelerators to help make adoption of Now Assist solutions easier and faster for customers.\n\"Worldwide spending on AI is projected to grow 3 times greater than the five-year CAGR for worldwide IT spending over the same period (2023-2028), driven by the rapid infusion of AI and GenAI for employee experience, customer engagement, business processes, and industry innovation,\" said Ritu Jyoti, general manager/group VP, AI, and Data market research and advisory at IDC. \"As organizations look to drive value from AI transformations, they recognize the need for a single and scalable platform that connects people, processes, data, and systems. ServiceNow is meeting customers where they are by streamlining workflows and simplifying complex processes on a single AI-powered platform. As ServiceNow expands GenAI into new areas of the enterprise, the company continues to help organizations transform operations and stay competitive.\"\nCustomers like EY are already seeing the benefits of Now Assist.\n\"GenAI is having a huge impact on our organization, both in the way EY teams deliver EY services and support EY people, but also in creating opportunities to go to market with ServiceNow to help EY clients transform their businesses,\" said Hank Prybylski, Global Vice Chair, Transformation, EY. \"We are seeing incredible value in the Now Assist space and looking to extend that to a whole suite of areas including customer service management and more broadly to our managed services environment.\"\nPutting data and AI to work across the Now Platform\nOn top of today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow recently announced Workflow Data Fabric, a breakthrough innovation that enhances all ServiceNow workflows, AI solutions, and AI Agents.\nThis enhanced, integrated data layer allows customers to connect, understand, and act on structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data across the enterprise, inside and outside of ServiceNow. Coupled with zero copy capabilities and the future integration of Knowledge Graph, which transforms raw data into contextual insights, ServiceNow is unifying people, processes, operations, and systems so AI can work more autonomously across the enterprise.\nThese data capabilities are an instrumental part of ServiceNow's vision of AI Agents that work autonomously and collaboratively with people to enable business transformation. This vision also includes the expansion of its partnership with NVIDIA to jointly develop AI agent use cases on the Now Platform and accelerate the adoption of Agentic AI, reinventing how AI delivers value across all industries.\nAvailability\nAI Governance for Now Assist is available today to a limited set of customers and is expected to be generally available in Q1 2025. All other new GenAI innovations announced today are now generally available to customers in the ServiceNow Store.\nAdditional Information\nLearn more about ServiceNow Now Assist here.\nRead about additional news from ServiceNow today:\nNew innovations enhance developer productivity, industry momentum\nServiceNow and Five9 expand partnership to deliver unified, end-to-end agent and customer experiences\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

          "whole_article": "Investing.com - Cloud software providers are expected to see a recovery in customer spending as a resilient economic environment pushes more businesses to invest in their artificial intelligence-powered technologies, according to analysts at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and peer Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) have also been pouring money into building out their own AI capabilities and folding them into their products, although investors have raised concerns around the timeline for the pay off from these expenditures.\nIn a note to clients, the Wells Fargo analysts led by Michael Turrin argued that ServiceNow is among the few software comapnies \"demonstrating tangible AI monetization,\" adding they expect the group to \"play offense\" in AI customer service. Businesses use ServiceNow's AI-backed products to automate and manage their IT processes and reduce costs.\nLast month, ServiceNow unveiled a fourth-quarter subscription revenue forecast that topped Wall Street expectations.\nThe firm, which has been rolling out new AI-enhanced offerings to its enterprise clients such as ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and video conferencing service Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), also increased its full-year subscription revenue outlook thanks to solid demand from new and existing customers.\nMeanwhile, ServiceNow's rival Salesforce has yet to show enough evidence its own AI offering will be enough to return growth to double-digits in the near term, the Wells Fargo analysts said.\nIn August, the software-as-a-service pioneer reported better-than-anticipated revenue of $9.33 billion in its second quarter and raised its annual profit outlook to a range of $10.03 to $10.11 per share, up from $9.86 to $9.94. But Salesforce's guidance for third-quarter revenue still missed expectations, exacerbating worries around a potential rebound in cloud spending.\nThe Wells Fargo analysts said they see more \"attractive opportunities\" in companies like ServiceNow that have already shown an ability to make money off of so-called generative AI. The setup for Salesforce heading into next is \"tough,\" they added.\nRelated Articles\nCloud software groups recovering heading into the end of 2024, Wells Fargo says\nNovavax cuts 2024 revenue forecast again on lower COVID vaccine sales\nTyson Foods beats quarterly results on strong demand for beef, pork\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nServiceNow (NOW) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 6.7%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\nTechnology is a Big Deal, Strategist Highlights\nThe Magnificent Seven continues to grasp a sizeable market share of the market gains over the past few years. That said, investors and analysts are excited to see what this earnings period has to offer for the magnificent seven and how much of an influence they have on the market. On October 31, Christian Dery, head of macro strategy at Capital Fund Management, appeared in an interview\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the impact of the magnificent seven on the market.\nDery suggested that these companies have grown to become large entities and their market capitalization often fluctuates by $2 billion to $400 billion on earnings events. Looking at the dispersion of the index, Dery adds that individual stocks within the S&P are very diverse and more independent, hinting towards a very low correlation in the index.\nHe adds that generative AI and LLMs are very different from the traditional software business. Therefore, the hyperscaling model that is conventionally taken from software can not be applied here. For every new customer in the software business, the marginal cost often goes down to nearly zero. However, if you look at the \u201ctech incumbents\u201d, they have to increase their capital expenditures to develop compute clusters and scale their operations, suggests Dery.\nIn 2023, the chips industry generated revenue of about $3 billion, reflecting that we are yet to find a killer use case or see results of generous AI spending. Dery adds that the market is more likely to be \u201cdiscerning\u201d on the path to profitability since companies are going to focus more on capital expenditures and projections for capital expenditures. He is particularly interested in the CapEx projections of the Magnificent Seven and shares that if they miss there could be a negative reaction among those stocks.\nDery reiterated that the market is yet to see the investments pay off multiple times but maintains his interest in capital expenditures by these companies playing out. While he is bullish on technological innovation and believes artificial intelligence is disruptive and a \u201cbig deal\u201d, he fails to see viable results as of now. Dery also emphasizes that these companies are directing their investments to AI because they do not want to fall behind competitors, with no proper timeline for AI monetization.\nStory Continues\nThat said, some companies are investing heavily in innovation and are at the forefront of a technological revolution.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we went over multiple similar rankings on the internet from credible financial websites. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NOW)'s AI Innovations Drive Revenue Growth and Strategic Partnerships\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software company that helps companies manage digital workflows and operations using its cloud computing platform. The company\u2019s Now Platform allows businesses to leverage AI to enhance productivity, automate workflows, scale for growth, and improve security.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) generated $2.79 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from the same quarter in 2023. Of this, subscription revenue was worth $2.72 billion, representing a growth rate of 23%. The company attributes this momentum to customers doubling down on ServiceNow as a leading AI platform for operational efficacy and business transformation. The company itself is confident in its future performance as the demand for AI continues to grow.\nDuring the quarter, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) processed its largest AI release to date, the Now Platform Xanadu release. The release encompasses hundreds of new and improved AI capabilities and generative AI solutions for the telecom, media, technology, and financial services industries. In addition to that, the company also partnered with NVIDIA to co-develop AI agents using Nvidia\u2019s blueprints in the ServiceNow platform. To align with its expansion strategy, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) also forged separate partnerships with Siemens, Rimini Street, and Pearson to develop AI use cases for different industries and customer segments.\nOverall, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an investor favorite because of its quality deals with major players in the industry. Similarly, the company has high growth expectations for the full fiscal year and the fourth quarter of 2024, contributing to its ranking as one of the best innovative stocks according to hedge funds.\nIthaka Group\u2019\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFounded in 2004,\u00a0ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW) has become the leading provider of cloud-based software solutions that define, structure, manage and automate workflow services for global enterprises. ServiceNow pioneered the use of the cloud to deliver IT service management (\u201cITSM\u201d) applications. These applications allow users to manage incidents and to plan new IT projects, provision clouds, manage application performance and build applications themselves. The company has since expanded beyond the ITSM market to provide workflow solutions for IT operations management, customer support, human resources, security operations and other enterprise departments where a patchwork of semi-automated processes have been used with varying success in the past. ServiceNow\u2019s stock appreciated in the quarter on the back of strong earnings that beat Street estimates on the top and bottom line, with the company pointing to strength in subscription revenues, cRPO, operating margins, and continued demand for the company\u2019s AI products.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Arista Networks ANET, Tesla TSLA and ServiceNow NOW.\n3 Momentum Stocks About to Surge (TSLA, NOW, ANET)\nOne of my favorite ways to pick winning stocks by combining two of the most effective methods out there; the Zacks Rank and momentum. The Zacks Rank is a highly effective quantitative strategy that aggregates all analyst ratings of a stock and converts them into a simple ranking. Momentum is one of the most well documented edge and is well known as a premier anomaly for investors to utilize for successful trading.\nTogether, these two techniques have helped me detect dozens of huge winners in the stock market and right now they have identified three highly compelling stock picks. Arista Networks, Tesla and ServiceNow all boast a top Zacks Rank and an A+ technical momentum setup, leading me to believe that they may be huge winners in the coming weeks and months.\nTesla: Bullish Setup and Strong Buy Stock\nTesla stock has been on a rather volatile and uncertain path this year as electric vehicle sales have slowed markedly. However, CEO Elon Musk is a master of surprising to the upside, and with humanoid robots, self-driving cars and a multitude of other side-bets within Tesla, there is always the potential for a huge run in the stock.\nOver the last two months, analysts have started to upgrade their earnings estimates for Tesla, and it now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 13.4% over the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have jumped by 7.5% over the same period.\nBut most notable is the technical chart pattern forming in Tesla stock price. After gapping higher following its quarterly earnings report, the price action has been building a highly compelling descending wedge. If the stock can trade above the $250 level, it would signal a breakout and may send the stock on another major bull run. Alternatively, if it loses the $240 level of support, the pattern will be invalidated, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.\nArista Networks: Stock Breaking out Now\nArista Networks, a leading provider of high-performance networking solutions primarily for data centers and cloud computing, is another stock to watch. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, ANET also boasts strong earnings growth forecasts and sits in the top 13% of the Zacks Industry Rank.\nOver the next three to five years, Arista Networks is projected to increase its earnings per share by an impressive 15.3% annually. Sales are also expected to grow nicely, with estimates of a 16.3% increase this year and 17.4% next year.\nStory Continues\nArista Networks stock is also breaking out of its technical pattern today. After building out a bull flag over the last month, ANET is staging a clear breakout. If the stock can hold above the $400 level, it should be the start of another rally. However, if it reverses and loses the breakout level, it may be a sign that the stock needs more time before climbing higher.\nServiceNow: Poised for Growth and a Bullish Breakout\nServiceNow is a cloud computing company that offers a suite of software solutions for IT service management, human resources, customer service, and more. These products help organizations automate routine tasks, enhance productivity, and improve employee and customer experience.\nServiceNow is a rapidly growing technology company that also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Earnings are projected to grow 24.7% annually over the next three to five years, while sales are expected to climb 22.3% this year and 20.1% next year.\nLike the other two stocks, NOW stock looks to be developing a very bullish technical pattern. After beating earnings estimates and gapping higher, the price action has been consolidating into a picture-perfect bull flag. Today, NOW stock is bumping up against the upper level of resistance, and if it can break out above the $955 level, it should send the stock significantly higher. However, if it loses the $930 level of support, investors may want to hold off and wait for other opportunities.\nShould Investors Buy NOW, ANET and TSLA Shares?\nThe current setups for Arista Networks, Tesla, and ServiceNow are quite convincing, blending strong fundamental growth with technical momentum. Each company boasts robust earnings growth forecasts, competitive market positions, and favorable chart patterns, making them solid candidates for those seeking high-potential momentum plays.\nFor investors with an appetite for growth and momentum, NOW, ANET, and TSLA offer a balanced blend of technical and fundamental indicators suggesting strong performance ahead. As always, keeping an eye on key price levels and being a keen risk manager will be key for trading them successfully.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Zacks Rank is a highly effective quantitative strategy that aggregates all analyst ratings of a stock and converts them into a simple ranking. Momentum is one of the most well documented edge and is well known as a premier anomaly for investors to utilize for successful trading.\nTogether, these two techniques have helped me detect dozens of huge winners in the stock market and right now they have identified three highly compelling stock picks. Arista Networks (ANET), Tesla (TSLA) and ServiceNow (NOW) all boast a top Zacks Rank and an A+ technical momentum setup, leading me to believe that they may be huge winners in the coming weeks and months.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla: Bullish Setup and Strong Buy Stock\nTesla stock has been on a rather volatile and uncertain path this year as electric vehicle sales have slowed markedly. However, CEO Elon Musk is a master of surprising to the upside, and with humanoid robots, self-driving cars and a multitude of other side-bets within Tesla, there is always the potential for a huge run in the stock.\nOver the last two months, analysts have started to upgrade their earnings estimates for Tesla, and it now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 13.4% over the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have jumped by 7.5% over the same period.\nBut most notable is the technical chart pattern forming in Tesla stock price. After gapping higher following its quarterly earnings report, the price action has been building a highly compelling descending wedge. If the stock can trade above the $250 level, it would signal a breakout and may send the stock on another major bull run. Alternatively, if it loses the $240 level of support, the pattern will be invalidated, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nArista Networks: Stock Breaking out Now\nArista Networks, a leading provider of high-performance networking solutions primarily for data centers and cloud computing, is another stock to watch. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, ANET also boasts strong earnings growth forecasts and sits in the top 13% of the Zacks Industry Rank.\nOver the next three to five years, Arista Networks is projected to increase its earnings per share by an impressive 15.3% annually. Sales are also expected to grow nicely, with estimates of a 16.3% increase this year and 17.4% next year.\nStory Continues\nArista Networks stock is also breaking out of its technical pattern today. After building out a bull flag over the last month, ANET is staging a clear breakout. If the stock can hold above the $400 level, it should be the start of another rally. However, if it reverses and loses the breakout level, it may be a sign that the stock needs more time before climbing higher.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nServiceNow: Poised for Growth and a Bullish Breakout\nServiceNow is a cloud computing company that offers a suite of software solutions for IT service management, human resources, customer service, and more. These products help organizations automate routine tasks, enhance productivity, and improve employee and customer experience.\nServiceNow is a rapidly growing technology company that also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Earnings are projected to grow 24.7% annually over the next three to five years, while sales are expected to climb 22.3% this year and 20.1% next year.\nLike the other two stocks, NOW stock looks to be developing a very bullish technical pattern. After beating earnings estimates and gapping higher, the price action has been consolidating into a picture-perfect bull flag. Today, NOW stock is bumping up against the upper level of resistance, and if it can break out above the $955 level, it should send the stock significantly higher. However, if it loses the $930 level of support, investors may want to hold off and wait for other opportunities.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy NOW, ANET and TSLA Shares?\nThe current setups for Arista Networks, Tesla, and ServiceNow are quite convincing, blending strong fundamental growth with technical momentum. Each company boasts robust earnings growth forecasts, competitive market positions, and favorable chart patterns, making them solid candidates for those seeking high-potential momentum plays.\nFor investors with an appetite for growth and momentum, NOW, ANET, and TSLA offer a balanced blend of technical and fundamental indicators suggesting strong performance ahead. As always, keeping an eye on key price levels and being a keen risk manager will be key for trading them successfully.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
