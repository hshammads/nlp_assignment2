        "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nNYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThe Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions\nThere\u2019s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump\u2019s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.\nBut there\u2019s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate \u2014 especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect \u2014 and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.\nThese cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk\u2019s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up just over 2%, while Facebook parent Meta is up less than 1%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 6%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 3.3%.\nAs the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they\u2019re thinking about. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying:\nTiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:\n\u201cTariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.\nWe have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.\u201d\nMark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we\u2019ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.\nI don\u2019t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.\u201d\nMark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.\n\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she\u2019s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.\u201d\nThreats against Alphabet and Meta are \u201cjust talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn\u2019t take kindly to that. However, I don\u2019t think anything like this will make it into policy.\u201d\nKevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management\n\u201cTrump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn\u2019t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn\u2019t put him the best light.\nThe thing that\u2019s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That\u2019s a counter perspective to that. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren\u2019t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.\nI don\u2019t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined. I have exposure to Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple. I don\u2019t know how tariffs will impact Nvidia, since the demand will remain there no matter what. Broadcom goes kind of hand in hand with that. I think that at Apple, Cook will take steps to keep the products from exploding in price.\u201d\nAdam Grossman, chief investment officer of global equity at Riverfront Investment Group:\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unclear a week after the election. I do think he could get tariffs through on China, but getting tariffs through on Europe, that\u2019s another ball of wax.\nFor someone like Donald Trump, I think he\u2019s going to have enough other issues that they\u2019re going to kind of fly off of his radar.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nChinese tech conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering an offering of bonds totaling the equivalent of about $5 billion as soon as this month, people familiar with the matter said.\nElon Musk\u2019s social media platform X sued to block a California law aimed at curbing AI-generated deceptive election content on social media, claiming the measure is an unconstitutional affront to free speech.\nMeta Platforms Inc. said it intends to appeal court rulings allowing dozens of states and hundreds of school districts across the US to proceed with lawsuits blaming \u201caddictive\u201d social media apps for contributing to a mental health crisis among youths.\nSamsung Electronics Co. plans to buy back about 10 trillion won ($7.2 billion) of its own stock over the next year, putting in motion one of the larger shareholder return programs in its history.\nLenovo Group Ltd. hiked its projection for global PC shipments in 2025 after posting better-than-expected earnings, saying AI features will help boost growth next year.\nEarnings Due Friday\nPremarket\nAlibaba\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nNorth Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\nOh, the Irony.

        "whole_article": "The deluge of goodbye messages from people leaving X began shortly after Donald Trump's election victory last week. In explaining their decision, many in the exodus cited the same thing: The huge support Elon Musk, the social media service's owner, gave the Republican candidate during the campaign and the increasing nastiness on his site.\nJody Avrigan, a podcast host and media producer with 50,000 followers on X, said on rival social media service Threads, that he was done using X, because \u201cElon Musk is a pretty destructive force in our society and politics, I want no part of him.\u201d Nicole Wallace, an anchor on MSNBC with over 1 million followers on X, said on live TV that she\u2019d \u201cdeleted Twitter today as an act of self preservation.\u201d Tee Wattress said on Threads she'd been on X for 15 years sharing comedic takes on pop culture and reality TV, but \"to see it turn into the hell scape that it is today has been devastating.\" Even the author and very active X user Stephen King joined Threads, telling his 7 million X followers that he was leaving the platform. \"Tried to stay, but the atmosphere has just become too toxic.\"\nThe large number of people swearing off X for other services may spell the end to social media as we know it. Instead of just of a tiny number of extremely popular sites for posting news, opinions, and memes, as has been the case for more than a decade, a number of new options are gaining millions of users, such Threads, owned by Facebook parent Meta, and Bluesky.\nDaily users of X, previously known as Twitter, have declined consistently since Musk acquired it in 2022. Last year, it had roughly 250 million daily active users and Musk claimed that the total would grow to 1 billion in 2024. On election day last week, X had only 162 million daily users\u2014and even that was a yearly high, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm that tracks the platform. A day later, that number had already dropped by 5 million, to 157 million daily users.\nUnder Musk's ownership, X has lost an average of 14% of its users monthly, according to Sensor Tower. Despite the slight boost in daily users on the day of the election, an \u201celongated slide in active users\u201d has continued, Sensor Tower\u2019s research lead Seema Shah told Fortune.\nShortly after taking over X, Musk made major changes to the platform to advance what he described as \"free speech,\" whittling down the hundreds of people that once worked on content moderation for Twitter to just a handful of contract employees, reinstating openly white supremacist or otherwise vitriolic personalities, and boosting only accounts that paid to be verified, effectively gamifying the entire platform. He also tilted the algorithm to favor inflammatory posts and conservative flash points, gleefully joining the fray himself, often passing along political and racial conspiracy theories to his 200 million followers.\nStory Continues\nLate in the recent presidential campaign, Musk overtly joined forces with Trump by campaigning for him and donating heavily to ensure a Trump victory, using X as a tool to that end. He has since been by Trump\u2019s side in Florida and has been rewarded by the President-elect as the co-head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, which shares an acronym with a cryptocurrency Musk often promotes.\nFor many users, such a platform, whatever it may have once been, is no longer fun or useful. And it's set off the latest chorus of people proclaiming their exit from X\u2014for good this time, even if many have decided to keep their accounts live, but vow not to post anything more on them.\n\u201cThere has been a steady drift away from X for a while,\u201d Jonathan Bellack, senior director of Harvard University\u2019s Applied Social Media Lab that\u2019s part of the Berkman Klein Center, told Fortune. \u201cAnd yes, we\u2019re seeing more people doing it more loudly at the moment, but people have been leaving for months and months. Now, I wonder if people are choosing to leave because of their beliefs, or because the experience on the platform has gotten worse.\u201d\nThis X diaspora has coincided with the rising influence of other forms of media, like podcasts, long-form video, group chats, and comments sections on YouTube and Discord, for instance. It's also come amid the increasing adoption of newly-founded social media platforms. Today, many public personalities and journalists\u2014long the backbone of Twitter and X\u2014post the same thing across Threads, Bluesky, and X, hedging their bets on what may go viral where.\nFor years, Twitter enjoyed near immunity from new rivals because its network effect was so strong. The more people who used it, the more useful it became and the more others therefore wanted to join. That flywheel spun for a long time, keeping social media startups and even behemoths like Meta, from even attempting to directly compete. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg quipped a decade ago that Twitter was \"a clown car that drove into a goldmine.\" When Musk started to take the wheels off of Twitter, Zuckerberg put 15 engineers to work building a veritable clone now known as Threads.\nWhatever people\u2019s reasons for leaving X, the two most likely places for people to land is either Threads or Bluesky, a startup initiated by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Both platforms debuted last year and are currently jockeying for first and second place in Apple\u2019s App store for most-downloaded free apps in the U.S. TikTok and WhatsApp, also owned by Meta, are in the top 10 as well. Meanwhile, X is in 29th place, behind other social apps like Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta.\nNo third party research service tracks when users delete an app from their phone. But SimilarWeb found that at least 115,000 users deactivated their X accounts via the web the day after the recent election. That same day, Google Search interest in the phrase \"Delete X\" rose 150% and has continued to grow by double digit percentage points each day since, according to Huge, a design and technology company that conducts custom research. Even news outlet The Guardian said this week it was abandoning all 80 of his official accounts, with a collective 27 million followers, due to the increase in\u00a0\u201cdisturbing content promoted or found on the platform.\"\nAnother data point is anecdotal: Over the past week, many top X users say they\u2019ve lost significant numbers of followers, ranging from dozens to hundreds or even thousands. Brent Troderian, who has over 150,000 followers on X, said on Threads that he\u2019s lost about 1,000 followers since the election. Another well-known figure on X, Aaron Rupar, who writes a newsletter on politics and media, said he hemorrhaged 10,000 of his nearly 1 million followers last week. \u201cWhile I'm not above a bad tweet or two, I don't think it's anything I posted,\u201d he wrote.\nAlthough there has been speculation online that some of these declines could be related to bots or inauthentic accounts suddenly leaving or being deleted from the platform, there is no clear evidence to support the notion.\nIn any case, such follower losses coincide with growth in activity on rival platforms. New users of Threads in the last month grew 394% year over year, according to Sensor Tower. Meta said in October the service had reached 275 million monthly active users. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram who also oversees Threads, said Thursday that the platform had added another 15 million users so far in November, and was \"going on three months with more than a million sign ups a day.\"\nWhile Bluesky has far fewer users, it's been a trending topic on X and Threads over the last week as people discussed where there were heading while leaving X. Since the election, it has added almost 1 million new users, to a total of nearly 15 million.\nTikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat have all added users as well each month over the last year, from 3% to 10%, according to Sensor Tower.\nDespite all of the apparent momentum away from X, and the manipulation of its content algorithm in favor of right-wing politics and Musk himself, at least some of the people who may be leaving X are being replaced by new users. It\u2019s possible there is a sort of swap going on\u2014use among people fed up with the pro-Trump drift and Musk's omnipresence is, to some extent, being covered by people who are attracted to exactly that.\n\u201cAlthough X has experienced this elongated decline in overall US active users over the past few years, it has seen a sizable uptick in new users, or those who had previously never registered a session on X,\u201d Shah of Sensor Tower told Fortune.\nAccording to Sensor Tower, new mobile app users for X jumped 17% in October, among the few notable increases it\u2019s seen since Musk\u2019s takeover.\nWhile this isn\u2019t enough to offset X\u2019s sustained loss in users since Musk\u2019s acquisition, the overall migration among social media platforms is part and parcel to a new era of online fragmentation. This online splintering is taking with it some of the cultural and media power that had coalesced around what was Twitter, according to Bellack of Harvard, and it\u2019s likely that no one platform or type of media will take up that position ever again.\n\u201cTwitter always had a level of influence that was disproportionate to its number of users \u2013 it had a public square feeling, yes, but there\u2019s no reason that\u2019s the only way social media can work,\u201d Bellack said. \u201cPeople leaving X, the fragmentation and people sorting themselves in other places, it\u2019s just reinforcing the notion that there will no longer be one definitive platform, and that\u2019s probably a good thing.\u201d\nAre you a tech employee or someone with insight or a tip to share?

The step can be used by companies to give them some breathing space from creditors to try to pay back their debts.\nIt is understood Typhoo is using the process to explore rescue options, with administrators from EY lined up. The court notice does not mean that Typhoo is in administration.\nTyphoo, which was founded in 1903 by Birmingham grocer John Sumner, was once one of the UK\u2019s best-selling tea brands.\nHowever, sales have struggled in recent years. Revenues fell from \u00a334m in 2022 to \u00a325m last year, while losses ballooned to \u00a338m from \u00a39.7m a year earlier, according to publicly available accounts.\nThe steep jump in losses came after the company suffered a break-in at its mothballed factory in Merseyside, which involved \u201cextensive damage\u201d to machinery and tea stock.

His comments suggest pubs could keep the same number of staff but focus them on delivering food and drink to tables rather than handling orders at the bar.\nSuch a system may enable them to get through a higher volume of orders, helping to increase revenues while keeping costs stable.\nMr Dodd is the latest pub chief to raise the prospect of fewer bartenders as a result of the Budget. The British Institute of Innkeeping (BII), which represents the pub sector, has said that three quarters of its members plan to cut staff hours, meaning fewer people would be working at any given time.\nRead the full story...\n05:06 PM GMT\nWorld stocks drop despite upward push in Europe\nA gauge of global stocks is lower for a third day in a row today, despite a strong push upwards from European stock markets.\nThe MSCI World index dropped 0.1pc during trading, but the major European indexes were all up.

These were its first back-to-back reductions in the current easing cycle, as eurozone growth worries increasingly outweigh inflation concerns.\nData released before the last meeting showed eurozone consumer prices rose by 1.7pc in September, the first time in three years the figure had dipped below the central bank\u2019s two-percent target.\nThat fired debate about whether the ECB had waited too long to start cutting borrowing costs, and whether there was now a risk of inflation falling well below target for a long time.\nAt the October meeting, while policymakers agreed inflation would settle at around two percent earlier than previous forecasts for the end of 2025, some argued that \u201ca large, persistent undershooting\u201d of the target was unlikely.\nFactors needed to cause it were not present, such as \u201cdisappointing economic growth that moved into recessionary territory, a weakening in the financial system, wage pressures fading away\u201d, according to the account of the gathering.\nOthers however worried that recent falls in inflation had been stronger than expected and said there was \u201can increasing risk of undershooting the target in the course of 2025, possibly in a sustained manner\u201d.\n\u201cThis could now be seen as a greater risk than overshooting the target,\u201d they believed.\nSince the ECB\u2019s last meeting however, data have been released showing that eurozone inflation rose to two percent in October, more strongly than expected.\nING economist Carsten Brzeski said the minutes showed concerns about the weak eurozone economy were now clearly overtaking those about inflation.\n03:38 PM GMT\nUK stocks rise amid signs of strong American economy\nThe FTSE 100 has turned higher after data showing the US economy is fairing well in the face of high interest rates.\nThe UK\u2019s blue chip index was up 0.5pc while the midcap FTSE 250 was up 0.6pc as American unemployment claims fell to a six month low.\nMeanwhile, a rise in US wholesale inflation was only slighly higher than expected.\nWith that I will hand you over to Alex Singleton, who will keep you updated on the markets from here.\n03:21 PM GMT\nThe Onion buys conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019s Infowars\nThe parody website The Onion has bought conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars brand and website in a bankruptcy auction, court documents show.\nJones filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022 after courts ordered him to pay $1.5bn for defaming the families of 20 students and six staff members killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\nUnable to pay those legal judgments, Jones was forced to auction his assets, including Infowars, in bankruptcy.\n\u201cThey\u2019re shutting us down,\u201d Jones said in a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m going to be here until they come in here and turn the lights off.\u201d\nThe Connecticut families of eight victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting backed the Onion\u2019s bid, saying it would put \u201can end to the misinformation machine\u201d that Jones operated.\nThe Onion will acquire Infowars\u2019 intellectual property, including its website, customer lists and inventory, certain social media accounts and Jones\u2019 Infowars\u2019 production equipment, the families said.\nParody website The Onion has bought the Infowars brand built by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones - Briana Sanchez/Pool via REUTERS\n03:08 PM GMT\nB&M billionaire Bobby Arora to step down next year\nB&M billionaire Bobby Arora will step down from the value retailer next year, despite having agreed a \u00a316m \u201cgolden handcuff\u201d\u00a0package to stay until 2026.\nB&M said Mr Arora would retire next March from his role as trading director after almost 20 years.\nBobby, 52, was the last of the three Arora brothers to have an active role with the retail giant, which they had built from a struggling Northern chain in 2004 into a \u00a33.9bn powerhouse.\nIt follows the exit of his brother Simon, who stepped down as chief executive of B&M in September last year. Simon had led B&M for 17 years.\nRobin, the third brother, also had been involved with the discount retailer but no longer has an active role.\nB&M boss Alex Russo said the decision for Mr Arora to step down came after the company \u201cidentified the right individual\u201d to take up his role.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer.\nIn a recent program, Jim Cramer celebrated the market\u2019s rally on Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, saying the market likes Trump.\n\u201cThe market likes Donald J. Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?\u201d\nCramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.\n\u201cTrump wants to cut taxes\u2014all taxes\u2014including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It\u2019s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that\u2019s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.\u201d\nCramer said the market is still \u201coversold\u201d as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground. However, Cramer said the polls were again proved wrong.\nCramer then talked about the stocks that investors can buy to ride the Trump rally.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Cramer and picked stocks he believes can go higher under the Trump presidency. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nJim Cramer Bullish on Meta Platforms (META), Rejects \u2018Scuttlebutt\u2019 About Trump-Zuckerberg Fued\nBloomua / Shutterstock.com\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nTalking about Meta, Cramer said:\n\u201cI would also buy Meta here. There\u2019s all sorts of bogus scuttlebutt \u00a0about how the President elect and Mark Zuckerberg don\u2019t get along. I think that\u2019s the old days people. \u00a0I believe things have gotten better between the two, and you should think more about the fundamentals now, which are fabulous. Look, there is some common ground between the two. People were worried about the two of them being angry at each other. No.\u201d\nStory Continues\nDespite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\nAccording to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta\u2019s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), the world\u2019s largest social network, were up this quarter, due to impressive top-line growth of 22% year-over-year and solid forward guidance. Despite its large scale, Meta continues to outgrow the broader digital advertising industry, with better AI-driven content recommendations increasing engagement in products like Instagram Reels, and AI improving ad targeting and conversion rates. Our industry checks have continued to validate advertiser adoption and satisfaction, with improvements in Reels monetization, as well as strong adoption of Advantage+, Meta\u2019s AI-driven service to allocate advertiser budgets across its content surfaces.\nOverall, META ranks 1st on our list of stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

A US judge ruled that the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against the company can continue to trial on Wednesday, while Donald Trump was elected US president again. His victory helped propel the social networking app Bluesky, which competes with Meta\u2019s Threads, to the top of Apple Inc.\u2019s US App Store.\nTrump called Facebook an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d just eight months ago and suggested Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg should go to jail.\nThe EU fine is likely to be one of the final acts for Vestager, who\u2019s set to leave her post before the end of the year. Over the past decade, she has been one of Silicon Valley\u2019s toughest critics levying billions of euros in antitrust penalties, including over \u20ac8 billion in fines against Google.\nThe decision follows a probe into how Meta leverages Facebook\u2019s billions of users to squeeze out rivals. EU watchdogs said Menlo Park California-based Meta also used data from rival platforms that advertised on Facebook to boost its Marketplace service.\nMeta vowed to appeal the decision at the bloc\u2019s courts, a process that could take several years. It said the penalty \u201cignores the realities of the thriving European market\u201d and \u201cshields large incumbent companies.\u201d\nMeta shares fell as much as 1% after trading opened in New York. The company was earlier fined \u20ac110 million by the EU merger regulator for providing misleading information about its takeover of messaging service WhatsApp in 2017.\nStory Continues\nAmazon.com Inc. dodged EU fines in a similar case in 2022, targeting how the US. ecommerce firm allegedly pillaged rivals\u2019 sales data to unfairly favor it own products. Regulators accepted a number of proposals from Amazon, including a vow to stop using non-public data on independent sellers on its marketplace for its competing retail business.\nFacebook\u2019s Marketplace has also been targeted by other regulators. It settled a probe with the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority after agreeing to a slate of concessions.\nMeta reported sales of $40.6 billion in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, a jump of 19% compared to a year earlier. In recent years, Meta has been working to balance huge outlays on technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality, while still trying to ensure that its core digital advertising business is still growing.\nWhile the EU can levy fines of 10% of global sales, its penalties are usually much smaller and take into account severity of the allegations and the sub-markets involved.\nThat\u2019s led to frustration among regulators and a clamor for tougher remedies, including more structural solutions. Like the US, the EU has been weighing a potential breakup of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google to allay concerns over its adtech dominance.\nThe new Digital Markets Act bolsters traditional antitrust law by placing strict guardrails on Silicon Valley firms.\nThe European Commission has kick-started probes into Google and Meta to vet their compliance with the DMA, while Apple Inc. is soon likely to face the bloc\u2019s first fine for failing to step into line with the rules. This week Meta pitched changes to the way it targets users with ads on Facebook and Instagram, in order to offset an escalation in the investigation.\n--With assistance from Jake Rudnitsky.\n(Updates throughout)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nNorth Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\nOh, the Irony.

This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.\n\u201cMeta must now stop this behaviour.\u201d\nIn response, Meta said it would appeal the decision but would comply with the Commission\u2019s ruling \u201cin the meantime\u201d and would \u201cwork quickly and constructively to launch a solution which addresses the points raised\u201d, adding that it would \u201cmake announcements shortly to reassure our European users that Facebook Marketplace is here to stay\u201d.\nIn a lengthy statement on the ruling, the US tech giant said: \u201cToday, the European Commission announced a decision claiming that Facebook Marketplace has hindered competition for online marketplaces in Europe.\n\u201cThis decision ignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services and shields large incumbent companies from a new entrant, Facebook Marketplace, that meets consumer demand in innovative and convenient new ways.\nStory continues\n\u201cWe will appeal this decision to ensure that consumers are well served in the EU.\u201d\nThe firm argued that by creating Marketplace in 2016 and allowing users to buy and sell items for no charge, it had given consumers \u201ca new choice beyond the large incumbent online marketplaces that have dominated the landscape\u201d, and disputed the Commission\u2019s claim that tying Marketplace to Facebook was an illegal link.\n\u201cThe European Commission\u2019s decision claims that Meta imposes Facebook Marketplace on people who use Facebook in an illegal \u2018tie\u2019.\n\u201cBut that argument ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose whether or not to engage with Marketplace, and many don\u2019t. The reality is that people use Facebook Marketplace because they want to, not because they have to,\u201d Meta said.\n\u201cWhile the European Commission could not find any evidence of harm to competitors, they claim the entry and expansion of Facebook Marketplace has the potential to hinder the growth of large incumbent online marketplaces in the EU instead.\n\u201cBut those very marketplaces are actually continuing to grow and dominate in the EU. Platforms like eBay, Leboncoin in France, Marktplaats in the Netherlands, Subito in Italy, Blocket in Sweden and Finn.no in Norway are formidable competitors and the market leader in many member states.\n\u201cThey have continued to report considerable commercial success, including strong financial results and growth, since Facebook Marketplace launched. Successful new entrants \u2014 such as Vinted \u2014 have also emerged and continue to grow and thrive in Europe.\u201d\nIt added: \u201cEU competition law is intended to protect the competitive process and consumers, not to preserve the established business positions of incumbent providers in the face of innovation.\n\u201cIronically, in the name of competition, this decision does just that at huge cost to consumers.\u201d"

As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing \u201csovereign\u201d artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to \u201ccodify\u201d a country\u2019s culture, history, and collective intelligence.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News You Must Read Today\nThat said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.\u201d\nWhile AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.\nLatest Advancements in AI\nIn recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents.

        "whole_article": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed higher on Thursday despite an overall decline in the stock market.\nConsumer group Which? has filed a \u00a33 billion ($3.81 billion) legal claim against Apple, accusing the tech giant of breaching UK competition law through its iCloud service.\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) reduced stake in Apple from 400 million to 300 million shares. Thus, Berkshire has now cut its position in the Cupertino, California-based tech giant by over two-thirds since 2023's third quarter.\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.44%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,369,320 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $273,864 or around 1,200 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 1.4% to close at $228.22 on Thursday.\n\n\nRead More:\nJim Cramer Recommends Microsoft, Praises American Water Works For Being \u2018Consistent\u2019\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

President Joe Biden largely re-upped Trump's policy in May \u2014 and added new tariffs on certain sectors on top.\nBiden exclusively told Sozzi at the time the fresh tariffs were about \"being fair.\"\nLooking ahead to the new administration, one proposed move involves a baseline tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports with an eye toward bolstering US manufacturing. Trump has also floated stiffer tariffs on China, and new ones on Mexico.\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s out. We know the short run effects [from tariffs] so far from 2019, which is that it improved the trade balance with China, but didn\u2019t necessarily improve the trade balance more broadly,\u201d Luzzetti said.\nThe great economic unknown on tariffs was echoed by top leaders such as Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan at this week's Yahoo Finance Invest conference.\nWatch more from the Invest conference here\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\nTrump, tariffs, and one unpredictable economy in 2025\nTesla stock to settle after recent surge: Nuveen CIO\nTrump\u2019s bitcoin superpower promise may help Nvidia: Tech investor\nLuzzetti ultimately views the data from Trump's first term as useful when forecasting what could be in the cards this time around.\nThe tariffs of 2019 focused heavily on China alongside materials like steel and aluminum. Luzzetti notes that what the economy of 2019 experienced \u201cwas some uplift in inflation.\"\n\u201c[The] economy did come under pressure as a result of the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it sparked a trade war. Financial markets took it very negatively.\u201d\nChina experienced a devaluation in its currency and in turn, global market sell-offs ensued.\n\u201cBut you can actually see the manufacturing sector, industrial production had picked up in 2018 and then it was down negative in 2019,\u201d Luzzetti pointed out. \u201cWe have clear evidence that tariffs do work as we expect, which is a negative supply shock for the economy in the short term.\u201d\nStory Continues\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nSince the election results last Tuesday, markets have ignored tariff risk, in some cases rising to record highs on news of Trump\u2019s victory. Closely watched stocks with global financial exposure such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) have also hovered near records.\n\"We have learned [there] cannot just be tariffs on one particular country, because it is unlikely that [it] reorients that production, say, out of China into the US,\u201d Luzzetti warns. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other stopping places that you get to before that.\u201d\nGrace L.

        "whole_article": "Key Insights\nThe projected fair value for Apple is US$245 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$228 share price, Apple appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\nAnalyst price target for AAPL is US$244 which is similar to our fair value estimate\nHow far off is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nView our latest analysis for Apple\nIs Apple Fairly Valued?\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$123.7b\nUS$131.3b\nUS$158.4b\nUS$175.8b\nUS$189.5b\nUS$200.1b\nUS$209.5b\nUS$218.1b\nUS$226.1b\nUS$233.6b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x12\nAnalyst x13\nAnalyst x4\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 5.62%\nEst @ 4.72%\nEst @ 4.09%\nEst @ 3.65%\nEst @ 3.34%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4%\nUS$115.2k\nUS$113.9k\nUS$127.9k\nUS$132.1k\nUS$132.6k\nUS$130.4k\nUS$127.2k\nUS$123.3k\nUS$119.0k\nUS$114.5k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$234b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.4%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.0t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.0t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$2.5t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.7t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$228, the company appears about fair value at a 6.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow November 15th 2024\nThe Assumptions\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.158. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\nStrength\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nMoving On:\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

        "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nNYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThe Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions\nThere\u2019s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump\u2019s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.\nBut there\u2019s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate \u2014 especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect \u2014 and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.\nThese cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk\u2019s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up just over 2%, while Facebook parent Meta is up less than 1%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 6%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 3.3%.\nAs the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they\u2019re thinking about. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying:\nTiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:\n\u201cTariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.\nWe have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.\u201d\nMark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we\u2019ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.\nI don\u2019t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.\u201d\nMark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.\n\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she\u2019s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.\u201d\nThreats against Alphabet and Meta are \u201cjust talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn\u2019t take kindly to that. However, I don\u2019t think anything like this will make it into policy.\u201d\nKevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management\n\u201cTrump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn\u2019t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn\u2019t put him the best light.\nThe thing that\u2019s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That\u2019s a counter perspective to that. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren\u2019t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.\nI don\u2019t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined. I have exposure to Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple. I don\u2019t know how tariffs will impact Nvidia, since the demand will remain there no matter what. Broadcom goes kind of hand in hand with that. I think that at Apple, Cook will take steps to keep the products from exploding in price.\u201d\nAdam Grossman, chief investment officer of global equity at Riverfront Investment Group:\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unclear a week after the election. I do think he could get tariffs through on China, but getting tariffs through on Europe, that\u2019s another ball of wax.\nFor someone like Donald Trump, I think he\u2019s going to have enough other issues that they\u2019re going to kind of fly off of his radar.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nChinese tech conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering an offering of bonds totaling the equivalent of about $5 billion as soon as this month, people familiar with the matter said.\nElon Musk\u2019s social media platform X sued to block a California law aimed at curbing AI-generated deceptive election content on social media, claiming the measure is an unconstitutional affront to free speech.\nMeta Platforms Inc. said it intends to appeal court rulings allowing dozens of states and hundreds of school districts across the US to proceed with lawsuits blaming \u201caddictive\u201d social media apps for contributing to a mental health crisis among youths.\nSamsung Electronics Co. plans to buy back about 10 trillion won ($7.2 billion) of its own stock over the next year, putting in motion one of the larger shareholder return programs in its history.\nLenovo Group Ltd. hiked its projection for global PC shipments in 2025 after posting better-than-expected earnings, saying AI features will help boost growth next year.\nEarnings Due Friday\nPremarket\nAlibaba\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nNorth Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\nOh, the Irony.

        "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nEvercore ISI Maintains \"Outperform\" Rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sees AI Benefits Driving Future Growth\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nMarket Capitalization: $3.39 trillion\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational corporation and technology company. This AI player has been heavily investing in artificial intelligence technology. Recently, it revealed its personal artificial intelligence system, Apple Intelligence, across many of its devices.\nOn November 13, Evercore ISI reiterated Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as \u201cOutperform\u201d with a price target of $250. The analysts deem it as one of their top picks heading into 2025, affirming that the tech giant is set to benefit from artificial intelligence in the long term.\n\u201cThe impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales remains highly debated and while it is unlikely we will see a super cycle this year, we do not think this should be overly concerning for investors\u201d.\nAs more AI features get incorporated, iPhone growth is also ticking higher, analysts note. Moreover, they state that the company\u2019s AI strategy isn\u2019t just limited to iPhones, rather, the company also possesses the ability to monetize third-party AI efforts. This ability will enable them to reap the AI rewards without the massive uptick in CapEx witnessed by their mega-cap peers, they penned.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

If he delivers on his campaign promises for an aggressive package of new US tariffs, they\u2019ve warned, a re-elected Donald Trump will set the stage for a historic period of turmoil in the global economy.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThe Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions\nAnd yet there\u2019s a reason CEOs, bankers, investors and even Trump advisers have largely shrugged off warnings about the damage a 10%-to-20% universal tariff and even higher import duties on China would do, or the resurgence in US inflation they might bring.\nFrom the incoming president\u2019s own track record, many see evidence Trump is unlikely to deliver on all he has threatened, and express confidence they can adapt to whatever he delivers this time around.\nEven as economists decried his plans as a terrible miscalculation, Trump ratcheted up protectionist threats on the campaign trail because they were a key part of an agenda popular with voters. After his win, he claimed a license to deliver on those promises.\n\u201cAmerica has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,\u201d Trump told supporters. \u201cSuccess is going to bring us together, and we are going to start by all putting America first.\u201d\nHis former trade czar, Robert Lighthizer, who is expected to have a prominent post in a new administration, has warned that the rest of the world should be ready for new US tariffs and that any country with a trade surplus should be willing to address Trump\u2019s grievances.\n\u201cCountries that run consistently large surpluses are the protectionists in the global economy,\u201d Lighthizer wrote in the Financial Times last week. \u201cWe would be merely responding to the harm they have caused.\u201d\nBut hanging over those threats are big questions: Is Trump bluffing, and even if he isn\u2019t, how will the world respond? His first term in office was renowned for chaotic economic policymaking and bitter internal battles between rival aides on trade.\nTrump also built a reputation as a transactional president, who was open to lobbying from CEOs like Apple Inc.\u2019s (AAPL) Tim Cook on tariffs and flattery from foreign counterparts who learned trade threats could be defused with a promise to buy more Iowa soybeans, or even a peck on the cheek.\nThe world has also changed. Companies have worked hard on adapting to tariffs \u2014 avoiding them where possible and realigning supply chains. These are core skills now, honed through the chaos of the COVID pandemic and the advent of an era in which geopolitics drives trade and investment more than the sole pursuit of cost efficiencies.\nStory Continues\nIn earnings calls Wednesday, executives at automakers including BMW (BMW.DE) and Honda Motor Co. (HMC, 7267.T) signaled they were prepared to weather any Trump tariff storm, thanks in large part to the large manufacturing operations they have already in the US.\n\u201cThere is some natural cover-up against possible tariffs or whatever, but let\u2019s not speculate whether there are tariffs. It might also only be that this is a verbal issue,\u201d Oliver Zipse, BMW\u2019s CEO and chairman, told analysts, pointing to growing sales in the US where it already manufactures cars. \u201cIn the United States, I would think we almost have a perfect setup for the time to come.\u201d\nStanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK) CEO Donald Allan Jr. told analysts recently the company had been planning for a Trump victory and a new tariff regime since the spring. The plan calls for price increases on its machine tools to offset any new duties and shifting production out of China to other Asian countries or Mexico as necessary.\n\u201cWe have a playbook on the shelf ready to go,\u201d Allan said. But that doesn\u2019t include doing what Trump wants companies to do. It\u2019s \u201cunlikely that we\u2019re moving a lot back to the US because it\u2019s just not cost effective to do,\u201d Allan said.\nWilliams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM), the home-furnishing chain, is ready for changes, too. Back in 2018, half of the San Francisco-based retailer\u2019s imports came from China. Now, that reliance is 25%, Jeff Howie explained to analysts recently. \u201cIf this does come up and tariffs are expanded, we\u2019re prepared to reduce it further.\u201d\nSuch planning reflects an acknowledgment of a new business reality. But it also illustrates a growing acceptance among both policymakers and executives that tariffs can be a useful tool for governments facing international competition.\nEverett Eissenstat, who served as Trump\u2019s representative to the Group of Seven and G-20 in his first administration and is now a partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs, said there was little to stop Trump from carrying out his tariff threats.\n\u201cThis is really a huge shift,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re entering into a period of a recalibration of the global trading system.\u201d\nEven true believers in protectionism admit broad tariffs have some negative side effects. Trump\u2019s victory sent the dollar (DX=F) sharply higher against Chinese, European and emerging market currencies. That raises the specter of not only less competitive US exports, but also potential economic turmoil outside the US that would reduce demand.\nTrump\u2019s stated goal for his trade strategy has always been to export more and import less. It\u2019s why he sees the US\u2019s persistent trade deficits as a profit-and-loss statement deeply in the red. A strong dollar that leads to US companies selling less overseas might anger Trump and only cause him to double down on protectionism.\nStill, senior bankers say privately that companies and policymakers around the world are confident they learned how to deal with Trump and his trade wars during his first term.\nSome of that has been fueled by other Trump advisers who quietly have been circulating on Wall Street and beyond for months, insisting that the now-incoming president\u2019s tariff threats will be used as negotiating leverage against countries including China \u2014 not to spark all-out trade warfare.\nThe economic risk, of course, is that this is America\u2019s frog-enjoying-the-warm-water-before-it-boils moment, where inflationary worries are ignored. One senior banker recently expressed concern that the clients he met with on his travels were in fact too sanguine about the turmoil ahead.\nAside From Tariffs\nTariffs aren\u2019t the only ways Trump can upend global trade.\nThe next few years will likely bring a renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 the rebranded North American Free Trade Agreement that was a signature trade achievement of his first term.\nTrump has signaled anger at Chinese investments in Mexican factories to produce electric vehicles and other products and avoid his original tariffs. He\u2019s also linked immigration to tariffs by threatening harsh levies on imports from Mexico, if the new government there doesn\u2019t block migrants from crossing to the US.\nDelivering on much of what Trump promised on the campaign trail may depend on who controls Congress. That\u2019s not necessarily the case with trade policy, in which US presidents have expansive authority to act unilaterally, particularly if national security can be invoked.\nAny restraint will have to come from within a new administration, from financial markets or from domestic constituencies hurt by US tariffs or their inevitable flipside: retaliation.\n\u2018Super Genius\u2019\nElon Musk\u2019s investments in both China, via Tesla (TSLA), and Trump\u2019s campaign could wield more influence on what the new president chooses to do than the hawks in his national security team. \u201cHe\u2019s a super genius,\u201d Trump told supporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe have to protect our super geniuses.\u201d\nThough Trump repeatedly shrugged off economists\u2019 warnings about his tariffs, the scale of the potential impact may also eventually end up giving him and his advisers pause.\nAccording to calculations by economists Maeva Cousin and Eleonora Mavroeidi of Bloomberg Economics, raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% and those from all other countries to 20% would lead to a bigger shock than even the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 delivered.\nThat legislation, widely credited with setting off trade wars that deepened the Great Depression globally, saw average US tariff rates go from 14% to close to 20%. Trump\u2019s proposals would send the average from 3% currently to more than 20%, a far steeper jump.\nCombined with retaliation from China and other countries, by the 2028 election the tariffs would lead to US economic output being 1.3% lower than otherwise, the Bloomberg Economics pair calculated.\nGiven the scope of the potential fallout, Anna Wong, Bloomberg Economics\u2019 chief US economist, says the most plausible scenario is that while Trump will increase some bilateral tariffs, he won\u2019t impose universal tariffs.\n\u201cWe think procedural requirements, as well as the response from the economy, will limit the scope of trade actions,\u201d Wong wrote in a research note this week. \u201cWe also assume US trade partners would retaliate in kind.\u201d\nIn a recent report, Goldman Sachs economists said the most likely scenario would feature higher duties on imports from China, delivered quickly. The top rates would likely be reserved for strategic products, with consumer goods facing lower levies. That would lead to an average tariff hike on China of around 20 percentage points, they calculated \u2014 a level lower than the 60% Trump has threatened.\nTrust Issue\nThere are those who also worry about a broader erosion in global trust in the US, even if Trump is slow to deploy his economic weapons.\nEmily Blanchard, who until last year served as chief economist at the US State Department and is now at Dartmouth College, said there is little doubt that a second Trump term will bring a further deterioration in the US standing in the world and its economic alliances.\n\u201cIf the US takes actions demonstrating that we\u2019re no longer committed to openness and fairness, rules and transparency and predictability, then the whole game changes,\u201d Blanchard said. \u201cFirms, investors and governments are going to try to protect themselves and build out contingency plans.\u201d\nFor those who believe that they can adapt to another Trump term or even charm their way through a trade standoff, there are examples to follow. Musk\u2019s rise in Trump\u2019s inner circle, for one, has proved that a politician once full of vitriol for electric cars can be won over by a man who made his fortune selling them.\nCook\u2019s Approach\nThen there was Apple\u2019s Cook, who managed to avoid most of the company\u2019s China-assembled products from being subjected to Trump\u2019s tariffs in August 2019 by flying in to dine with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Cook\u2019s argument was simple: How could Apple compete against South Korean rival Samsung if the government was going to make his products more expensive?\n\u201cI thought he made a very compelling argument,\u201d Trump told reporters the next day. Most of Apple\u2019s products have avoided the 25% tariffs that other imports have faced.\nApple CEO Tim Cook attends the Wall Street Journal Magazine's Innovator awards at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, October 29, 2024. (TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 TIMOTHY A. CLARY via Getty Images\nSome national leaders similarly courted Trump, and seem to be preparing to do the same in a second term. Mindful of the risk their trade surplus with the US presents, South Korean officials have for months been drafting a plan to boost energy imports from the US if Trump is elected, Bloomberg reported this week.\nEuropean officials now girding themselves for a new rise in transatlantic tensions have their own examples to draw on.\nIn July 2018, facing a potentially devastating Trump threat of tariffs on European cars, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was then president of the European Commission, flew to Washington to try to work out a deal.\nThe night before a scheduled Oval Office meeting, two senior aides to the respective presidents hashed out a compromise under which the EU would buy American soybeans and natural gas. But whether Trump would embrace the deal was unclear, people close to the talks said.\nUntil the next day: Juncker marched into Trump\u2019s office for the meeting and planted a healthy kiss on Trump as a greeting that not only charmed Trump but caused him to order up a Rose Garden press conference to quickly unveil the unfinished deal.\n\u201cObviously the European Union,\u201d as represented by Juncker, \u201cand the United States, as represented by yours truly, love each other!\u201d Trump later tweeted, attaching a photo of the kiss.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nNorth Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\nOh, the Irony.

Personally, I\u2019m bearish on Intel and TSMC, but I\u2019m bullish on AMD, expecting it to experience continued market share gains and share price appreciation over the medium term.\nWhile AMD is unlikely to reach the heights we\u2019ve seen at Nvidia, the stock could see further supportive trends over the next three to five years. Meanwhile, I\u2019m put off TSMC by its geographical concentration risk and Intel represents too big a risk after years of technological underinvestment.\nAMD: The Next Big Winner?\nLet\u2019s start with AMD. The stock has surged over the past two years, but nowhere near as much as Nvidia. However, it\u2019s arguably Nvidia\u2019s biggest competitor in terms of technological capabilities in the fast-growing data center and AI segment. The company is also making significant strides in developing its \u201cfull-stack\u201d offering \u2014 software to complement the hardware \u2014 which could substantially enhance its competitiveness in the AI market.\nAMD\u2019s recent acquisition of ZT Systems marks an important step in this full-stack direction, representing its first major foray into comprehensive AI software solutions. This strategic move is expected to improve system-level integration, reduce time-to-market for AI solutions, and expand AMD\u2019s reach into the hyperscale market.\nAnd there\u2019s plenty of market to grow into. That\u2019s because AMD currently holds less than 5% of the GPU market share for AI and around 11% of the overall AI market share (including CPUs). AMD is positioning itself for growth and claims that its EPYC processors and Instinct accelerators offer superior performance for AI inferencing workloads, particularly in data centers.\nAMD\u2019s Valuation\nThe problem with AMD is that some fairly considerable growth expectations are already priced in. The stock is currently trading at 44.4x forward earnings and has a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.08. So, while the company is expected to grow earnings by around 40% annually over the medium term, there\u2019s clearly some downside risk because of the sizeable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Still, I\u2019m bullish on AMD.\nI\u2019m expecting earnings to surge over the coming years as hyperscalers seek Nvidia alternatives as part of a broader effort to de-risk and expand the supply chain. I understand that the stock is pricey, but I really don\u2019t see these AI-related tailwinds slowing down for AMD.\nStory Continues\nOn TipRanks, AMD comes in as a Strong Buy based on 26 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by Wall Street analysts in the past three months. The\u00a0average AMD stock price target\u00a0is $187.04, implying a more than 34.3% upside potential.\nSee more AMD analyst ratings\nIntel: It\u2019s Losing Out\nIntel has largely missed out on the initial AI boom that has propelled competitors like Nvidia and AMD to new heights in 2024. Nvidia has dominated the market for AI accelerators, and AMD has made significant inroads, but Intel has struggled to gain traction with its AI offerings.\nHowever, while Intel\u2019s chip business may have been falling behind for almost a decade now, Intel may be poised for a recovery in 2025 as it ramps up its AI strategy. The company has been investing heavily in developing new AI-focused products and technologies, as Intel\u2019s upcoming Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake processors are slated for release in late 2024 and early 2025. Both are designed to better support AI workloads on PCs and servers.\nThe company is targeting over 100 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2025, which could help it regain market share. Additionally, Intel\u2019s partnership with Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) AWS to build custom AI Fabric Chips and Xeon 6 processors represents a major opportunity in the data center and cloud AI market. It\u2019s a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar deal and could significantly boost Intel\u2019s AI credentials.\nIntel Might Not Surge Back\nHowever, Intel\u2019s foundry services present both challenges and opportunities. The foundries are currently being consolidated into an independent subsidiary and may play a crucial role in the company\u2019s AI strategy or could be sold \u2014 although a buyer might be hard to find.\nBy attracting more third-party customers for chip manufacturing, Intel could position itself as a key player in the AI hardware ecosystem. However, many of Intel\u2019s production nodes use the company\u2019s proprietary electronic design automation (EDA) tools and flows and are designed for Intel CPUs.\u00a0That may be something that needs addressing if Intel is to service the wider market more regularly.\nOn TipRanks, INTC comes in as a Hold based on one Buys, 22 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The\u00a0average INTC stock price target\u00a0is $24.43, implying about 2% downside potential.\u00a0Personally, and as someone who broadly avoids trying to catch falling knives, I\u2019m bearish on Intel. Of course, a recovery may be in the cards, but it\u2019s not a risk I\u2019d wish to take as an investor.\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\nTSMC: A Winner with Concentration Risk\nInterestingly, TSMC has said it won\u2019t be looking to buy Intel\u2019s foundry business despite being one of the few companies in the world with the financial capacity to do so. I say \u2018interestingly\u2019 because Intel\u2019s foundries are located all around the world, including in places like Ireland and Israel. Meanwhile, TSMC\u2019s foundries are located predominantly in Taiwan \u2014 an island nation claimed by Beijing \u2014 creating a degree of concentration risk.\nOf course, there are a host of reasons why TSMC wouldn\u2019t buy Intel\u2019s foundries, including the fact that Intel\u2019s nodes will be different from those of the Taiwanese company \u2014 as noted above. Moreover, TSMC has its own expansion strategy, which includes notable projects in the United States, Japan, and Europe.\nMore generally, the company is already well-positioned to benefit from increasing demand for advanced chips in AI, 5G, and high-performance computing applications. TSMC\u2019s continued investment in cutting-edge process technologies should help maintain its competitive edge while benefiting from other companies\u2019 success as a major supplier to firms like Nvidia.\nTSMC\u2019s Discount Is Not Enough\nHowever, geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan pose a risk to TSMC\u2019s operations, resulting in the stock typically trading at a discount to peers. TSMC currently trades at 27.2x forward earnings, representing a 6.9% premium to the information technology sector as a whole. However, the PEG ratio indicates that, on face value, this stock is undervalued with a ratio of 0.8.\nOn TipRanks, TSM comes in as a Strong Buy based on five Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The\u00a0average TSM stock price target\u00a0is $205, implying about 9.8% upside potential.\nSee more TSM analyst ratings\nPersonally, given the existential and geopolitical risks facing Taiwan and TSMC\u2019s operations base, I\u2019m turning bearish on the stock. It\u2019s gone too high for the geopolitical risk in my opinion. I realize that this is a change of tune for me, but at nearly $200 a share, it\u2019s not a risk I\u2019m willing to take.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

        "whole_article": "By Amy Tennery and Dawn Chmielewski\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A showdown between former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and social media influencer-turned-fighter Jake Paul on Friday is the latest one-two punch from Netflix, as the media giant hopes to cash in on sports' sprint to streaming.\nThe intergenerational showdown has all the makings of a crossover hit, with 58-year-old Tyson bringing in the old guard and 27-year-old Paul, who achieved early fame on YouTube, appealing to the younger, screen-toting social media junkies.\nAvailable to all of Netflix's more than 280 million subscribers for no additional fee, it could be a welcome change for American boxing fans accustomed to shelling out extra to watch marquee matches on long-time broadcaster HBO.\n\"The trend in all sports right now is moving some of their properties to streaming,\" said Bob Dorfman, a veteran San Francisco-based sports marketing analyst.\n\"This is two huge personalities - it does have the potential to be the biggest streaming sports event.\"\nThe American subscription television network HBO announced in 2018 it was dropping live boxing from its programming, ending a 45-year relationship with the sport and leaving a broadcasting vacuum in its wake.\nNetflix has dabbled in sports content before, with exhibition golf and tennis events and the wildly popular docuseries \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive,\" which is credited with boosting the auto racing circuit's popularity in the U.S.\nThe fight at the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, its first live boxing event, works in favor of Netflix's strategy of providing proprietary content that viewers cannot find elsewhere.\nWhile the fight will not have traditional advertising, it has sponsors whose messages will be part of the live streamed event.\nAdvertising is not a major contributor to the streamer's current revenue, though its ad-supported tier is quickly growing, with 70 million subscribers reported this week, up from 40 million in May.\nThe mega-event is the sign of a lasting love affair between sport and streaming, said Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports, though he predicts streaming and traditional broadcast will exist side-by-side for the foreseeable future.\n\"This is a one-time-only event... It's more as a novelty in my view. It doesn't change the industry,\" said Pilson, president of Pilson Communications.\n\"The industry is still going to be driven by the league deals (like) MLS, NFL, Major League Baseball.\"\nAmazon Prime picked up Thursday Night Football in 2021 and MLS signed a 10-year mega-deal with Apple TV in 2022 worth a reported $2.5 billion.\nStory Continues\nMajor League Baseball signed a deal with Apple for \"Friday Night Baseball,\" a weekly doubleheader, in 2022, as well.\nLeagues have been gravitating to streaming both because it reaches a global audience, including younger viewers, who are not watching traditional television.\nMLS Commissioner Don Garber said the Apple streaming platform allows MLS to better take advantage of the sport's global fanbase.\n\"We were seeing the difficulty of getting an audience and getting the economics right with local and regional television - we saw that in 2018,\" Garber said this week at the Paley International Council Summit.\n\"We wanted to go to the market with a global package... We have a subscription that's global, every one of our 600 games is treated like 'Monday Night Football'.\"\n(Reporting by Amy Tennery in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

        "whole_article": "Disney's (DIS) box office magic is back, and that's taking its stock to one of the happiest places on Earth for investors.\nShares of Disney surged 9% in early trading on Thursday following a solid quarterly earnings beat and upbeat long-term guidance. The company's ticker page was the No. 1 most active on the Yahoo Finance platform.\nThe advance takes Disney's stock up about 23% year to date, outperforming the 16% gain for the Dow.\n\"I do think that the focus on raising the bar on quality and delivering, really, I think the best content in the industry is an indication that the magic is back at Disney,\" Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief (video above).\nThe financial performance of Disney's entertainment business stole the show, no pun intended. Its sales surged 14% on the back of strong performances from Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine. Operating profits hit $1.1 billion, up from $236 million a year ago.\nJohnston believes the momentum is poised to continue with key franchise releases of Moana 2 and the Lion King coming up.\nThe company's parks and linear TV businesses continue to be challenged for several reasons, however.\nSales in Disney's experiences segment \u2014 which houses the global theme park business \u2014 only rose 1% year over year as cautious consumers kept a lid on spending. Operating income fell 5%. Attendance was relatively unchanged year over year.\nJohnston said the parks business is beyond its low point and that he doesn't think venues such as Shanghai Disney would get roped into a potential Trump administration trade war with China.\n\"We're about bringing smiles to people's faces. We're about creating moments for families. We're about creating joy. That's not a political thing by any stretch of the imagination. And frankly, I think most political leaders would look at Disney and say, you know what? That's something that I want to make sure our citizens get to enjoy,\" Johnston explained.\nAs for the linear TV network business \u2014 which includes ABC and ESPN \u2014 sales and profits dropped 6% and 38%, respectively.\nThe company has undergone rounds of layoffs in its TV business over the past year, but the shift to streaming continues to be fast and furious \u2014 likely requiring deeper cost cuts.\nJohnston says he ran the numbers for CEO Bob Iger, and it makes more sense to stay in the traditional TV business.\n\"I think the core for us is really the content creation that comes out of our networks. It plays across both distribution channels, and that's really the most important thing,\" Johnston added.\nStory Continues\nDespite the weak areas of Disney's vast portfolio, investors appear to be latching on to the view that a rebound in the entertainment business and a more cost-focused Disney is all that matters right now.\n\"Stepping back, we continue to like the medium-term story for Disney, save for linear networks where expectations we think are set appropriately and ongoing cost cuts could help to soften the rate of decline. Content performance is strong with film releases year to date performing at or well beyond previous franchise iterations, which should fuel demand for Disney+ ahead of a password share crackdown and price increase,\" said JPMorgan analyst David Karnovsky in a client note.\nKarnovsky said Disney's renewed success at the box office provides \"confidence\" in further momentum around upcoming releases. He rates Disney shares at Overweight, or the equivalent of a Buy.\nThe earnings rundown\nNet sales: $22.6 billion, +6% from the prior year, vs. $22.47 billion estimate\nEntertainment revenue: $10.8 billion, +14% year over year, vs. $10.66 billion estimate\nDirect to consumer revenue: $5.78 billion, +15% year over year, vs. $5.82 billion estimate\nSports revenue: $3.91 billion, flat year over year, vs. $3.95 billion estimate\nExperiences revenue: $8.24 billion, +1% year over year, vs. $8.2 billion estimate\nDisney+ subscribers: 158.6 million vs. 156.82 million estimate\nTotal operating income: $3.7 billion, +23% year over year, vs. $3.71 billion estimate\nAdjusted EPS: $1.14, up 39% from the prior year vs. $1.10 estimate\nWhat else caught our attention: Forward comments\nFY25 Outlook\nHigh-single-digit percentage adjusted EPS growth (consensus: +19.8%)\nFY26 Outlook\nDouble-digit percentage adjusted EPS growth (consensus: +12%)\nFY27 Outlook\nDouble-digit percentage adjusted EPS growth (consensus: +10%)\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) we really liked what we saw.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Netflix is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.23 = US$9.6b \u00f7 (US$52b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nTherefore, Netflix has an ROCE of 23%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Netflix\nNasdaqGS:NFLX Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Netflix compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Netflix .\nThe Trend Of ROCE\nNetflix is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 23%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 76% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\nIn Conclusion...\nTo sum it up, Netflix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Since the stock has returned a staggering 172% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

But in the end, Netflix\u2019s desire for recurring global hits eclipsed any lingering concern about collateral dental damage. Hwang got to work writing more episodes.\nOn Dec. 26, one day after Netflix shows its first pro football games, the second season of Squid Game will arrive with much fanfare.\n\u201cPeople loved that first season \u2014 you saw Halloween costumes and people wanting to play the games and share iconography,\u201d Bela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said in a recent interview. \u201cPeople wanted more of it. When they love a show, they want to live it, experience it, connect with it.\u201d\nAccording to internal Netflix calculations, the first season of Squid Game had generated $900 million in value for the streaming company shortly after its September 2021 debut. With the arrival of season two, Squid Game stands out as one of the first TV shows from South Korea to spawn a global franchise, spanning everything from reality TV to video games to in-person fan experiences.\nHwang\u2019s anti-capitalist parable originated out of his own desperation. During the 2008 financial crisis, which devastated the South Korean film industry, the screenwriter, now 53, was down on his luck. With just a few credits to his name and less than $10 remaining in his bank account, he wrote a story about a survival game in which indebted, penniless Koreans compete to the death for an unimaginable fortune.\nOnce completed, the original script proved too confusing, violent and expensive for any buyers in South Korea. While the idea languished unsold, Hwang found work directing a trio of movies for local studios. Eventually, he found a fresh buyer.\nFollowing the introduction of its streaming service in South Korea in 2016, Netflix was on the prowl for programming there that the major broadcast networks and movie studios had overlooked. Enter Hwang. From the start, given the popularity of South Korean film and TV across the region, Netflix\u2019s team in Seoul believed that Squid Game could be a hit in its home country and potentially reach new viewers across Asia, where the streaming giant was investing tens of billions of dollars to grow its presence.\nStory Continues\nIn the fall of 2021, the show \u2014 an exploration of just how far despairing people will go to survive amid disturbing conditions \u2014 made its debut, landing in a world still intensely stressed-out from the Covid-19 pandemic. Almost overnight, the macabre series blew-up into a global phenomenon, topping Netflix\u2019s list of the most-watched titles on every continent. Critics were similarly impressed, and Squid Game became the first foreign-language program ever nominated for best drama at the Emmy Awards while ricocheting through US culture. Saturday Night Live spoofed it, and YouTube star MrBeast made a real-life, Squid Game-inspired game show \u2014 the resulting video has since been viewed more than 660 million times. Netflix told Hwang that if he had a good idea, they\u2019d love to keep the momentum going.\nMost Korean dramas last just one season, but Hwang had left the door open to extending the story with the way he ended the final episode \u2014 and there were other, economic reasons to press ahead. Netflix had paid for the first season almost entirely up front, so while many cast members would win international prizes and acting roles in Hollywood as a result of its success, they weren\u2019t immediately sharing in the company\u2019s windfall. A few months after the show\u2019s premiere, the streaming giant did pay some of the talent one-time bonuses. Even so, Hwang felt motivated to write more episodes.\nAs discussions for a second season ramped up, Hwang hired the powerful talent shop Creative Artists Agency as well as a Hollywood law firm that represents clients such as Scarlett Johansson and Matthew McConaughey. In the ensuing negotiations, his new team made sure that he would have plenty of money to address any future dental emergencies.\n\u201cWe felt doing a second season would provide a more adequate compensation, befitting the success of this show,\u201d Hwang said.\nIn May 2022, he started writing, eventually mapping out two additional seasons. By the summer of 2023, producers were back at work shooting new scenes at a soundstage outside of Seoul.\nWith the new programming coming down the pipeline, Netflix looked for other ways to extend the franchise. The company ordered a reality show, adapted from the series and using a similar-looking set. It began developing a multiplayer video game based on the show. In New York, Netflix set up a commercial escape room experience where fans could test their own survival instincts. And the streaming giant held discussions with award-winning director David Fincher, the director of The Social Network and Fight Club, about the possibility of producing an English-language adaptation.\nMeanwhile, ahead of the show\u2019s return in December, Netflix is rolling out ads everywhere from TV to billboards to New York subway cars, commencing one of the largest promotional campaigns in the company\u2019s history. At a shopping center in the Philippines, Netflix has erected a replica of a giant, freaky doll that appeared in the first season. Several major consumer brands, including Crocs and Johnnie Walker, have teamed up with the company to create a slew of Squid Game-themed products.\nWhile Squid Game is a global phenomenon, it has paid especially big dividends in Asia, which has surpassed Latin America as the streaming service\u2019s third-biggest region with 52.6 million customers, as of the end of September. In recent years, producers in South Korea have delivered several more global hits for Netflix, including Extraordinary Attorney Woo, All of Us Are Dead and The Glory.\nThe third and final season of Squid Game will debut in 2025. After that, Hwang said, he\u2019s ready to take a long break. \u201cThis is going to be my last series ever,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will do it ever again. Humanly, physically, mentally, I am just pushing my limit beyond what\u2019s possible.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nNorth Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\nOh, the Irony.

Stewart made her mark on Snoop.\n\"She sat next to me, and she stole the show. She was the funniest roaster that night,\"\nSnoop said in a 2019 NBC News interview. \"In that moment I knew I wanted to be alongside this lady for the rest of my life,\u201d he added.\nSince then the two have partnered up for public appearances, at one point even helming a reality show called Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party.\nAt this point, Snoop even reads Stewart\u2019s contracts.\u201cWe do a lot of work together, and I wait for him to negotiate the contract, then I go and follow him,\u201d Stewart told the Journal.\nHe\u2019s likely a good person to contact for business savvy after all, Snoop is reportedly worth $160 million, per Celebrity Net Worth. He\u2019s built an empire off his own name, and is champion for closing the Black wealth gap.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be one of those examples of someone who creates his own everything, owns his own everything, and has a brand strong enough to compete with Levi\u2019s and Miller and Kraft and all of these other brands that have been around for hundreds of years,\u201d Snoop said in a 2021 interview with the New York Times.\nHaving a stake in the game is essential for Snoop when it comes to signing off on a product. \u201cI want some equity. Give me a piece of the pie.

She\u2019s landed on her feet to some degree, as she\u2019s still a millionaire and continues to appear in more projects. Presumably, Snoop has been some help.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

        "whole_article": "Disney DIS\u00a0is a stock Wall Street will be watching closely this week with the media conglomerate set to release results for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday, November 14.\nWith Disney shares up a respectable +13% year to date, investors may be wondering if there is more upside ahead as earnings approach.\nDisney\u2019s Q4 Expectations\nDisney\u2019s Q4 sales are expected at $22.59 billion, a 6% increase from $21.24 billion in the comparative quarter. More intriguing, Disney\u2019s cost-saving initiatives appear to be working with Q4 earnings projected to increase 33% to $1.09 per share versus EPS of $0.82 a year ago.\nExceeding earnings expectations for seven consecutive quarters, Disney has posted an impressive average EPS surprise of 18.01% in its last four quarterly reports. Disney has exceeded top line estimates in two of the last four quarters with an average sales surprise of 1.05%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDisney\u2019s Streaming Memberships\nReductions to its workforce and reduced operating costs among its streaming segments have been the main catalyst for Disney's increased probability.\nEPSN+ subscribers are expected at 25.73 million with Disney+ users forecasted at 120 million. However, Disney+ subscribers would reflect a noticeable dip from the 150 million paid members in the same period last year. Still, when including Hulu subscribers which are projected at 51 million, Disney is edging toward 200 million total streaming memberships.\nThis is second to streaming leader Netflix NFLX\u00a0who recently reported over 280 million paid memberships in October.\nMonitoring Disney\u2019s Valuation\nAt around $102, Disney\u2019s stock trades at 19.2X forward earnings which is a nice discount to the S&P 500\u2019s 25.3X and Netflix\u2019s 41.4X.\nFurthermore, DIS trades at the optimum level of less than 2X sales compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 5.4X and Netflix\u2019s 9X.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTakeaway\nDisney's Q4 results will be crucial to reconfirming the company\u2019s return to growth as its stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That said, long-term investors could certainly be rewarded given Disney\u2019s appealing valuation with the Average Zacks Price Target of $114.92 a share suggesting 14% upside for DIS.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The media veteran was the head honcho at CNN from May 2022 to June 2023.\nHow to fix the issue is the multibillion-dollar question facing the nation\u2019s most powerful news executives, as growing distrust is one of several factors contributing to the industry\u2019s steady ratings decline.\nNielsen data showed TV viewership of the presidential election coverage fell by a quarter from four years ago, with the three largest cable news networks \u2014 CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News \u2014 all reporting a drop from 2020.\nFormer CNN CEO Chris Licht (left) with Yahoo Finance anchor Seana Smith (right) at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Nov. 12, 2024.\nRecent executive commentary and Q3 results have further highlighted the massive challenges in the industry. Paramount (PARA) reported continued declines in its linear TV business in the third quarter, while Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) saw a 3% year-over-year decline in revenue, fueled in part by cord cutting.\nThe decreasing viewership has prompted media giants to rethink the strategy surrounding their linear networks.\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Licht\u2019s former boss, said on his company\u2019s earnings call last week that he\u2019s exploring \"all things operationally and strategically\" to ensure shareholder value.\nOne of the options long speculated by Wall Street: a potential spinoff.

        "whole_article": "Two Reasons to Watch Netflix and One to Stay Cautious\nSince November 2019, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of 92.7%. But one standout stock has more than doubled the market - over the past five years, Netflix has surged 191% to $822.90 per share. The party hasn\u2019t stopped as it\u2019s also gained 33.5% in the last six months, beating the market by 19.1%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the performance may have investors wondering how to approach the situation.\nIs NFLX\u2019s stock a buy right now? Or is the market overestimating its value?\nFind out in our full research report, it's free.\nTwo Reasons We Like Netflix\nLaunched by Reed Hastings as a DVD mail rental company until its famous pivot to streaming in 2007, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is a pioneering streaming content platform.\n1. EBITDA Margin Reveals a Well-Run Organization\nInvestors frequently analyze operating income to understand a business\u2019s core profitability. Similar to operating income, EBITDA is the most common profitability metric for consumer internet companies because it removes various one-time or non-cash expenses, offering a more normalized view of profit potential.\nNetflix has been a well-oiled machine over the last two years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a consumer internet business, boasting an average EBITDA margin of 24.2%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it\u2019s a show of well-managed operations if they\u2019re high when gross margins are low.\nNetflix EBITDA Margin\n2. Free Cash Flow Margin Increased, Juicing Financials\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Netflix\u2019s margin expanded by 18.4 percentage points over the last three years. This is encouraging because its free cash flow profitability rose more than its operating profitability, suggesting it\u2019s becoming a less capital-intensive business. Its free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 19%.\nNetflix Free Cash Flow Margin\nOne Reason To Stay Cautious:\u00a0Customer Spending Decreases\u2026 Engagement Falling?\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Netflix because it measures how much the average user spends. ARPU is also a key indicator of how valuable its users are (and can be over time).\nStory Continues\nNetflix\u2019s ARPU fell over the last two years, averaging 1.4% annual declines. This isn\u2019t great, but the increase in global streaming paid memberships is more relevant for assessing long-term business potential. We\u2019ll monitor the situation closely; if Netflix tries boosting ARPU by taking a more aggressive approach to monetization, it\u2019s unclear whether users can continue growing at the current pace.\nNetflix ARPU\nFinal Judgment\nThere are definitely things to like about Netflix, and with its shares topping the market in recent months, the stock trades at 29x forward EV-to-EBITDA, or $822.90 per share. Is now a good time to buy?\nSee our in-depth research report, it's free.\nStocks We Like More Than Netflix\nNow, with the elections behind us, rates dropping and inflation cooling off, many analysts are expecting a breakout market to the end of the year \u2014 and we\u2019re zeroing in on the stocks that could benefit immensely.\nTake advantage of the rebound by checking out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Netflix, Inc., Salesforce, Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, BK Technologies Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nNetflix\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past two years (+169.1% vs. +77.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that the planned launch of an in-house ad tech platform next year signals the company's commitment to maximize its revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year in 2025. A robust, localized and foreign-language content lineup and healthy customer engagement levels have helped.\nHowever, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ remains a headwind.\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\nSalesforce\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer \u2013 Software industry over the past year (+58.7% vs. +21.3%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company\u2019s sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving growth. Continued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. Salesforce\u2019s strategy of continuous expansion of generative AI offerings are also helping it to tap the growing opportunities in the space.\nYet, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Softening IT spending amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties might hurt its growth prospects.\n(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here >>>)\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the last six months (+20.4% vs. +19.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, the launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, has strengthened the company\u2019s security portfolio.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include including The Walt Disney Company DIS, Amazon AMZN, Netflix NFLX and Comcast CMCSA.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nTo Buy Or Not To Buy: Disney Ahead of Q4 Earnings\nThe Walt Disney Company is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Nov. 14.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $22.59 billion, suggesting modest growth of 6.37% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\nThe consensus mark for earnings has moved south by a penny to $1.09 per share over the past 30 days, indicating growth of 32.93% year over year.\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nIn the last reported quarter, Disney delivered an earnings surprise of 15.83%. The company\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.01%.\nThe Walt Disney Company price-eps-surprise | The Walt Disney Company Quote\nEarnings Whispers\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Disney this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\nDIS has an Earnings ESP of -1.63% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nFactors Shaping Upcoming Results\nAs the media landscape shifts from traditional linear TV to streaming, Disney finds itself in an enviable position. With two robust U.S. streaming services, Disney+ and Hulu, complemented by ESPN+, the entertainment giant is well-equipped to navigate this transition seamlessly.\nOne of Disney's key advantages is its bundling strategy, which combines these streaming services into a compelling package. This approach is not only expected to have boosted average revenue per account in the to-be-reported quarter but is also likely to have helped reduce customer churn.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, Disney expects Disney+ Core subscribers to grow modestly. The company remains optimistic projecting profitability of the combined streaming businesses to improve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, with both Entertainment DTC and ESPN+ expected to be profitable in the quarter.\nStory Continues\nHowever, DIS is likely to have suffered from a persistent decline in Linear TV revenues, which is expected to have negatively impacted Media and Entertainment Distribution revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.\nOur model estimates for Entertainment revenues (which include Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing and Other Revenue) are pegged at $9.44 billion, indicating a decrease of 0.8% year over year.\nDIS\u2019 true strength lies in its unparalleled portfolio of Intellectual Property (IP). From the iconic Marvel and Star Wars franchises to the beloved Disney princesses, Mickey Mouse and Pixar's timeless classics, the company owns the most powerful collection of IPs in the media industry. This wealth of IP is a significant asset, as it gives audiences an immediate connection to the content, reducing the risk associated with content investments.\nThe company's extensive library of IP not only fuels its studio operations but also underpins its entire business ecosystem, including streaming, linear networks and the profitable Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products segment.\nIn the Experiences segment, DIS expects that the demand moderation it saw in domestic businesses in the fiscal third quarter could impact the next few quarters. While the company is actively monitoring attendance and guest spending and aggressively managing the cost base, Disney expects the Experiences segment\u2019s operating income to decline by mid-single digits compared with the prior year, reflecting these underlying dynamics as well as impacts at Disneyland Paris from a reduction in normal consumer travel due to the Olympics and some cyclical softening in China.\nAs we discuss the quarter under review, investors should pay close attention to key metrics, such as park attendance, per-capita spending and any announcements regarding expansion plans, particularly in international markets. The performance of this segment might have provided a strong foundation for Disney's overall growth trajectory.\nOur model estimate for the Experiences segment (renamed from Disney Parks, Experiences and Products) revenues is $9.13 billion, indicating 12% growth year over year.\nDespite experiencing strong demand at Disney Cruise Line in the quarter under review, results in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to reflect pre-launch expenses for Disney Adventure and Disney Treasure.\nPrice Performance & Valuation\nShares of DIS have returned 11.7% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector\u2019s growth of 10%. Disney operates in a fiercely competitive streaming market dominated by the likes of Amazon-owned Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, as well as the growing prominence of services from Apple, Comcast -owned Peacock and HBO Max.\nValuation-wise, Disney is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 19.53X compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry\u2019s 19.11X, reflecting a stretched valuation. The company\u2019s debt balance of $47.5 billion compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and its current marketable investment securities balance of $5.95 billion.\nInvestment Considerations: Balancing Risk and Reward\nDisney remains a prominent name in the investment world, long revered as a blue-chip stock and a staple in many portfolios. DIS' strength lies in its globally recognized brand and diverse intellectual properties spanning movies, TV shows, theme parks and merchandise. This diverse portfolio has historically given Disney a unique edge in captivating audiences worldwide and generating consistent revenue streams.\nHowever, recent years have brought significant challenges, including disruptions in traditional media, pandemic impacts on theme parks and evolving consumer behaviors. These headwinds have prompted investors to reevaluate Disney's appeal, questioning whether the Magic Kingdom can maintain its former allure in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing entertainment landscape.\nFinal Thought\nDisney remains a diversified media and entertainment powerhouse with a strong brand and valuable intellectual property. Its theme parks and resorts continue to be a significant revenue driver, and the potential for growth in emerging markets of Asia remains promising. However, the accelerating trend of cord-cutting continues to put pressure on this segment, potentially offsetting gains in other areas.\nFor those considering how to play Disney stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, a nuanced approach may be warranted. Investors with a shorter investment horizon may want to exercise caution and wait for a better entry point, given the uncertainties surrounding the company's growth prospects and the competitive pressure it faces despite the enduring power of the Disney brand.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

President Joe Biden largely re-upped Trump's policy in May \u2014 and added new tariffs on certain sectors on top.\nBiden exclusively told Sozzi at the time the fresh tariffs were about \"being fair.\"\nLooking ahead to the new administration, one proposed move involves a baseline tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports with an eye toward bolstering US manufacturing. Trump has also floated stiffer tariffs on China, and new ones on Mexico.\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s out. We know the short run effects [from tariffs] so far from 2019, which is that it improved the trade balance with China, but didn\u2019t necessarily improve the trade balance more broadly,\u201d Luzzetti said.\nThe great economic unknown on tariffs was echoed by top leaders such as Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan at this week's Yahoo Finance Invest conference.\nWatch more from the Invest conference here\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\nTrump, tariffs, and one unpredictable economy in 2025\nTesla stock to settle after recent surge: Nuveen CIO\nTrump\u2019s bitcoin superpower promise may help Nvidia: Tech investor\nLuzzetti ultimately views the data from Trump's first term as useful when forecasting what could be in the cards this time around.\nThe tariffs of 2019 focused heavily on China alongside materials like steel and aluminum. Luzzetti notes that what the economy of 2019 experienced \u201cwas some uplift in inflation.\"\n\u201c[The] economy did come under pressure as a result of the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it sparked a trade war. Financial markets took it very negatively.\u201d\nChina experienced a devaluation in its currency and in turn, global market sell-offs ensued.\n\u201cBut you can actually see the manufacturing sector, industrial production had picked up in 2018 and then it was down negative in 2019,\u201d Luzzetti pointed out. \u201cWe have clear evidence that tariffs do work as we expect, which is a negative supply shock for the economy in the short term.\u201d\nStory Continues\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nSince the election results last Tuesday, markets have ignored tariff risk, in some cases rising to record highs on news of Trump\u2019s victory. Closely watched stocks with global financial exposure such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) have also hovered near records.\n\"We have learned [there] cannot just be tariffs on one particular country, because it is unlikely that [it] reorients that production, say, out of China into the US,\u201d Luzzetti warns. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other stopping places that you get to before that.\u201d\nGrace L.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other trending AI stocks on latest news and analyst ratings.\nOpenAI, the AI startup of ChatGPT fame, recently urged the United States government and allies to come together to develop the AI infrastructure needed to compete with China. According to a report published by Bloomberg, the startup has said that the US and neighboring countries should form a North American Compact for AI that can streamline access to talent, financing and supply chains for building out the technology. The company further added this collaboration could later expand to include a global network of US allies and partners, including countries in the Middle East.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAt an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, the startup issued a new policy blueprint, saying that the US should backstop energy infrastructure projects by committing to purchase power from them. The company further urged the US to establish AI Economic Zones that speed up the permitting process and help bring nuclear reactors back online. It also proposed expanding nuclear energy capacity by tapping the US Navy, which has built compact reactors to power submarines. The company is already working with Microsoft to set up an AI fund needed to develop AI chips, energy and data centers.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "whole_article": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Nov. 20.\nFor the fiscal third quarter, the company expects revenues of $32.5 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $32.81 billion, which indicates a whopping 81% increase from the year-ago reported figure.\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been revised upward by a penny to 74 cents per share over the past 60 days. This suggests year-over-year growth of 85% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of 40 cents per share.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings of the pioneer of graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated computing surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 12.7%.\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nEarnings Whispers for NVIDIA\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVIDIA this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate (76 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (74 cents per share), is +2.30%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\nZacks Rank: NVDA carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nFactors Shaping NVIDIA\u2019s Upcoming Results\nThe continued strength of its Datacenter business on the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA\u2019s third-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.\nThe Datacenter end-market business is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to have aided the segment\u2019s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Datacenter end market is pegged at $28.48 billion, which indicates robust year-over-year growth of 96%.\nMoreover, NVIDIA\u2019s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market\u2019s last five quarters\u2019 results improved year over year as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products. Revenues from the Gaming end market increased 16% year over year to $2.88 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Gaming end market stands at $3.11 billion, which implies a 9% increase from the year-ago quarter.\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA\u2019s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing in the four consecutive quarters. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter for the end market. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Professional Visualization end market is pegged at $557 million, which suggests a 34% increase from the year-ago quarter.\nThe company\u2019s Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in eight of the last nine quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal third quarter due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $340 million, which indicates year-over-year growth of 30%.\nNVIDIA Stock Price Performance & Valuation\nYear to date (YTD), NVDA stock has skyrocketed 196.2%, outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s growth of 139.5%. Moreover, NVIDIA shares have outpaced the gains of major chip makers, including Micron MU, Marvell Technology MRVL and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Micron and Marvell Technology have registered an increase of 16% and 50.4%, respectively, while Advanced Micro Devices declined 5.8% YTD.\nYTD Price Return Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value NVIDIA offers investors at the current levels. NVIDIA is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 21.89X compared with the industry\u2019s 17.86X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Consideration for NVDA\nOver the past year, NVIDIA\u2019s revenue growth has been fueled by robust demand for chips needed for generative AI model development. NVIDIA dominates the market for generative AI chips, which have already proven useful across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\nThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\nHowever, the complexity of generative AI, which demands vast knowledge and immense computational power, means that enterprises will need to upgrade their network infrastructures significantly. NVIDIA\u2019s AI chips, including the A100, H100 and B100, are the top choices for building and running these powerful AI applications, positioning the company as a leader in this space. As the generative AI revolution unfolds, we expect NVIDIA's advanced chips to drive substantial growth in both its revenues and market presence.\nNVDA: In a Nutshell\nAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into AI, data centers and autonomous vehicles. The company's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity.\nWhile NVDA stock\u2019s premium valuation might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to its consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. The company enjoys high market esteem, and savvy investors should consider leveraging NVDA\u2019s potential for sustained long-term growth.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The episode then explores three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks not named Nvidia to buy now on the dip\u2014Taiwan Semiconductor, Constellation Energy, and Micron.\nSee the Zacks\u00a0Earnings Calendar\u00a0to stay ahead of market-making news.\nThe recent sideways movement helped cool off a red-hot market and more profit-taking seems likely at some point relatively soon given how far above some key moving averages both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are trading.\nThankfully, the next dip will likely be bought up rather quickly given how upbeat Wall Street is about the likelihood of lower corporate taxes, less red tape, and economic growth-focused efforts during a second Trump term. Wall Street is also pleased with the outlook for earnings growth and the Fed\u2019s rate cut projections.\nEven though the market is rather overheated, with Nvidia and others trading right near all-time highs, several impressive AI stocks are already trading well below their records.\nWhy Taiwan Semiconductor Stock is a Great Buy and Hold Tech Investment\nNvidia, Apple, and other technology heavyweights rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM\u00a0to build their most cutting-edge chips.\nTaiwan Semi pioneered the dedicated semiconductor foundry business model that transformed TSM into the most dominant player in the vital industry, earning a reported 61% of the semiconductor foundry market share in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTaiwan Semi is ramping up its industry-leading 3-nanometer technology, which is fueling the AI boom and beyond. Shipments of Taiwan Semi\u2019s 3-nanometer chips accounted for 20% of total Q3 wafer revenue, up from 15% in Q2, with \u201cadvanced technologies\u201d making up 69%.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe costs and institutional knowledge required to build the most cutting-edge semiconductors create an almost impenetrable moat around Taiwan Semi. TSM is addressing geopolitical fears by expanding its manufacturing footprint beyond Taiwan into Japan and the U.S. On top of that, Taiwan Semi pays a dividend and its balance sheet is solid.\nTSM posted another beat-and-raise quarter in mid-October, providing\u00a0upbeat AI-boosted guidance again. The chip maker is projected to grow sales by roughly 26% in 2024 and 24% in FY25 to soar from $69 billion in 2023 to $108 billion next year. Taiwan Semi is projected to boost its adjusted earnings by 30% and 28%, respectively. And its upbeat EPS outlook helps it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTaiwan Semi stock has more than tripled the Zacks Tech sector over the past 20 years. TSM has climbed 255% in the past five years and 80% YTD. Yet TSM stock trades 9% below its mid-October highs and 19% below its average Zacks price target. TSM stock is attempting to find support at its 50-day moving average.\nOn the valuation side, Taiwan Semi trades at a 34% discount to its 10-year highs at 22.3X forward 12-month earnings and 17% below the Zacks Tech sector\u2014Nvidia (NVDA) trades at 43.5X.\nWhy CEG is a Must-Own AI and Nuclear Energy Stock\nConstellation Energy CEG\u00a0cemented the long-term relationship between nuclear and AI when it secured its 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft in September.\nConstellation is the largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator, boasting over 20 reactors at roughly a dozen sites across the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast. Constellation is retrofitting its current nuclear power plants to keep them running for a lot longer, reopening decommissioned plants, and venturing into next-gen nuclear technologies.\nConstellation benefits from the U.S. government\u2019s active support for nuclear energy expansion. The U.S. earlier this week doubled down on its pledge to triple its nuclear energy capacity by 2050. \u201cThe importance of AI and the data economy to America\u2019s economic competitiveness and national security can\u2019t be overstated, and Constellation will do our part to meet the moment,\u201d CEO Joe Dominguez said in prepared Q3 remarks.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCEG posted solid Q3 results on November 4, pointing to \u201cvisible, double-digit long-term base EPS growth backed by the Nuclear Production Tax Credit.\u201d CEG has boosted its balance sheet in 2024. This should help it grow through mergers and acquisitions and return more value to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.\nConstellation announced in early 2024 its plans to boost its dividend per share by 25% in 2024, exceeding its 10% annual growth target.\nConstellation shares have surged 95% YTD (10th best S&P 500 stock) and 145% in the last two years. CEG has dropped since its release as investors took home profits following its massive run. The nuclear energy giant is trading 20% below its early October highs and 22% below its average Zacks price target.\nConstellation stock is trading at some of its lowest RSI levels over the past 12 months. CEG is also attempting to find support near its May highs. If Constellation stock falls to its 200-day moving average it might offer a great entry point for traders and long-term investors.\nBuy This AI Semiconductor Stock Down 35% from Its Highs?\nMicron Technology, Inc. MU\u00a0is one of the largest makers of memory chips. MU\u2019s offerings are found in PCs, smartphones, and most critically these days, data centers. Micron said earlier this year that AI will drive record demand for memory chips. Micron is currently a key memory chip supplier for Nvidia\u2019s AI processors. Micron plans to build a leading-edge memory \u201cmegafab\u201d to help meet growing memory chip demand.\nMicron topped our Q4 FY24 earnings estimate in late September on the back of 93% YoY revenue growth, driven by \u201crobust AI demand.\u201d Micron is projected to grow its revenue by 52% in FY25 and another 25% next year to climb from $25 billion in FY24 to $48 billion in FY26 (following 61% YoY expansion in FY24).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMU\u2019s earnings outlook has dipped slightly recently. Still, Micron\u2019s FY26 consensus estimate is up 230% during the past 12 months. Micron is projected to more than double its adjusted earnings in FY25 (+130%) and 45% next year to expand from $1.30 a share in FY24 to $12.55 next year.\nWall Street dumped the historically volatile stock following its rally to all-time highs in June. Samsung and others are ramping up their memory chip efforts. But Micron\u2019s growth outlook remains stellar, and 23 of the 27 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are \u201cStrong Buys\u201d and it pays a dividend.\nMU stock has climbed 190% in the past 10 years, lagging tech\u2019s 320%. Yet MU has soared 1,200% in the last 15 vs. Tech\u2019s 620%. Micron trades 35% below its summer records and 46% below its average Zacks price target. MU is trying to find support near its 50-week and 50-day moving averages. MU is also trading at a 60% discount to tech at 10.9X forward earnings and near its 10-year median.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Schafer anticipates substantial upside in Nvidia\u2019s October quarter results and January quarter guidance, driven by consistent demand from cloud service providers (CSPs) and enterprise clients for AI accelerators.\nAlso Read: Nvidia Powers Tesla\u2019s Humanoid Robots With New AI Tech: Here\u2019s What To Expect In 2025\nSchafer has revised his estimates upward, citing robust traction for Nvidia\u2019s Hopper AI accelerators and the initial ramp-up of the new Blackwell chips, which will likely begin in the fourth quarter.\nHe projects that Blackwell will contribute several billion dollars in revenue for the January quarter despite ongoing supply constraints related to CoWoS-L capacity.\nThe analyst foresees a significant acceleration in Blackwell sales by the first quarter (April), with investors modeling between 5-6 million GPUs next year.\nIn 2025, Schafer expects the product mix to favor drop-in HGX modules and air-cooled NVL36 GB200 racks as they integrate more easily into existing data center infrastructures. He stated that liquid cooling challenges may take time to resolve.\nNvidia\u2019s rack-scale solutions, which include CPUs and networking components, could offer a 10 times increase in average selling prices (ASP) compared to standalone modules.\nSchafer sees Nvidia\u2019s Data Center (DC) segment, which comprises 87% of total revenue, growing 9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and 97% year-over-year (YoY) in the third quarter, led by the H200 chip.\nThe broader Blackwell product line will likely ramp up in the first quarter, with future iterations like the Blackwell Ultra scheduled for late 2025. Schafer estimates that 60% of the data center sales will come from training, while 40% will be from inference.\nHe forecasts over $10 billion in sales from sovereign AI projects this year, although this may face long-term risks from potential U.S. export restrictions.\nFor the Networking segment, accounting for 14% of Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue, Schafer projects a 9% QoQ increase and 60% YoY growth, driven by robust Spectrum-X Ethernet switches and DPUs shipments.\nHe expects Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Spectrum-X800 to launch in 2025, catering to large-scale accelerator clusters, followed by the Spectrum-X1600 in 2026.\nIn the Gaming segment, which makes up 10% of revenue, Schafer anticipates 5% QoQ and 6% YoY growth in the third quarter, fueled by strong sales of discrete PC GPUs.\nStory Continues\nHe highlighted the upcoming launch of Nvidia\u2019s 50-series Blackwell GPUs in early 2025, alongside a 3nm PC CPU developed in collaboration with MediaTek.\nSchafer estimates Nvidia\u2019s free cash flow (FCF) to be $16.5 billion for the third quarter, with $97 billion projected for the full year 2025. He stated that Nvidia has $57.5 billion remaining on its stock buyback authorization, with cash and debt balances of $34.8 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.\nBased on revised earnings estimates, Schafer raised his calendar year 2024, 2025, and 2026 EPS forecasts to $2.85, $4.16, and $5.04, up from previous estimates of $2.80, $3.77, and $4.51.\nHe also increased his price target for Nvidia stock, citing improved free cash flow and a stronger balance sheet. Nvidia trades 29 times his calendar year 2026 EPS estimate, below its five-year average of 37 times.\nSchafer views Nvidia as a long-term buy, highlighting its leading position in AI hardware and software, strong gross and operating margins, and dominant data center ecosystem as core drivers of sustained growth.\nNvidia stock surged 205% year-to-date as U.S. Big Techs splurged on their AI ambitions. Investors can gain exposure to the AI wave through Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) and Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ).\nPrice Action:\u00a0NVDA stock traded lower by 0.22% at $146.45 premarket at the last check on Friday.\nAlso Read:\nASML Projects Revenue Surge to $63 Billion by 2030, Eyes AI and Chip Market Boom\nImage via Shutterstock\nLatest Ratings for NVDA\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nGoldman Sachs\nReinstates\nNeutral\nFeb 2022\nSummit Insights Group\nDowngrades\nBuy\nHold\nFeb 2022\nMizuho\nMaintains\nBuy\nView More Analyst Ratings for NVDA\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.61%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.47%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.64%.\nComing into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 7.77% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 3.03%, while the S&P 500 gained 3.07%.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Nvidia in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on November 20, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $0.74 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 85%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $32.81 billion, indicating an 81.07% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $2.82 per share and a revenue of $124.9 billion, signifying shifts of +116.92% and +105.01%, respectively, from the last year.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Nvidia. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.23% higher. As of now, Nvidia holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Nvidia has a Forward P/E ratio of 51.8 right now. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 26.56 for its industry.\nAlso, we should mention that NVDA has a PEG ratio of 1.45. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As the market closed yesterday, the Semiconductor - General industry was having an average PEG ratio of 3.15.\nStory Continues\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 42, placing it within the top 17% of over 250 industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

According to a report published by Bloomberg, the startup has said that the US and neighboring countries should form a North American Compact for AI that can streamline access to talent, financing and supply chains for building out the technology.

        "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nNYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThe Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions\nThere\u2019s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump\u2019s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.\nBut there\u2019s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate \u2014 especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect \u2014 and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.\nThese cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk\u2019s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up just over 2%, while Facebook parent Meta is up less than 1%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 6%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 3.3%.\nAs the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they\u2019re thinking about. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying:\nTiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:\n\u201cTariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.\nWe have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.\u201d\nMark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we\u2019ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.\nI don\u2019t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.\u201d\nMark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.\n\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she\u2019s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.\u201d\nThreats against Alphabet and Meta are \u201cjust talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn\u2019t take kindly to that. However, I don\u2019t think anything like this will make it into policy.\u201d\nKevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management\n\u201cTrump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn\u2019t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn\u2019t put him the best light.\nThe thing that\u2019s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That\u2019s a counter perspective to that. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren\u2019t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.\nI don\u2019t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined. I have exposure to Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple. I don\u2019t know how tariffs will impact Nvidia, since the demand will remain there no matter what. Broadcom goes kind of hand in hand with that. I think that at Apple, Cook will take steps to keep the products from exploding in price.\u201d\nAdam Grossman, chief investment officer of global equity at Riverfront Investment Group:\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unclear a week after the election. I do think he could get tariffs through on China, but getting tariffs through on Europe, that\u2019s another ball of wax.\nFor someone like Donald Trump, I think he\u2019s going to have enough other issues that they\u2019re going to kind of fly off of his radar.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nChinese tech conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering an offering of bonds totaling the equivalent of about $5 billion as soon as this month, people familiar with the matter said.\nElon Musk\u2019s social media platform X sued to block a California law aimed at curbing AI-generated deceptive election content on social media, claiming the measure is an unconstitutional affront to free speech.\nMeta Platforms Inc. said it intends to appeal court rulings allowing dozens of states and hundreds of school districts across the US to proceed with lawsuits blaming \u201caddictive\u201d social media apps for contributing to a mental health crisis among youths.\nSamsung Electronics Co. plans to buy back about 10 trillion won ($7.2 billion) of its own stock over the next year, putting in motion one of the larger shareholder return programs in its history.\nLenovo Group Ltd. hiked its projection for global PC shipments in 2025 after posting better-than-expected earnings, saying AI features will help boost growth next year.\nEarnings Due Friday\nPremarket\nAlibaba\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nNorth Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\nOh, the Irony.

Google initially launched it in February 2023 under the name Bard, and has since added more capabilities while weathering controversies.\nGoogle announced the voice feature during an August event and first added it to phones powered by its own mobile operating system, Android.\nTechnical advances in AI spurred by the rise of large language models have fostered the emergence of a new generation of voice assistants far more capable than Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant.\nGoogle's Gemini Live is a replacement of Assistant, an eight-year-old product built using older AI technology.\nHundreds of employees on the Voice Assistant team were laid off in January as part of a reorganization to \"become more efficient,\" a company spokesperson said at the time.\nGoogle has since consolidated further. Last month it folded the Gemini app team into DeepMind, its AI research lab, in a move that CEO Sundar Pichai also attributed to increasing efficiency.\nDeepMind is among the research organizations implementing new techniques to improve AI models as the traditional approach of building ever-bigger models has run in to unexpected delays and challenges, Reuters reported this week.\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\nView Comments"

        "whole_article": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\u2019s AI Surge: Why Cramer Sees Big Potential in This Rapidly Growing Stock\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nCramer pointed out how software stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) took off on Tuesday.\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a prominent technology company known for developing and supporting a wide range of software, services, devices, and solutions. The company has positioned itself well to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for generative AI software, an area that Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts will see a massive increase in spending. By 2032, generative AI software spending is expected to rise by 2,790%, approaching $320 billion and growing at an annual rate of 52%.\nThe company has been tapping into this opportunity by focusing on generative AI copilots, which have shown promising early results. During the first quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that the company\u2019s AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion in the next quarter, making it the fastest-growing business in the company\u2019s history to achieve this milestone.\nMicrosoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Nadella also pointed out that the use of Azure OpenAI has more than doubled in the past six months, reflecting the increasing adoption of AI-driven solutions. Additionally, AI has played a significant role in driving growth in the company\u2019s cloud services, contributing approximately one-third of the cloud services sales growth in the most recent quarter.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 6th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time\u00a0 frame.

Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for CrowdStrike Holdings, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.012 = US$53m \u00f7 (US$7.2b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).\nThus, CrowdStrike Holdings has an ROCE of 1.2%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 9.0%.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024\nIn the above chart we have measured CrowdStrike Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CrowdStrike Holdings for free.\nWhat Can We Tell From CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE Trend?\nThe fact that CrowdStrike Holdings is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 1.2% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 439% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.\nOur Take On CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE\nIn summary, it's great to see that CrowdStrike Holdings has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CrowdStrike Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\nOne more thing, we've spotted 2 warning signs facing CrowdStrike Holdings that you might find interesting.\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD has staged an impressive comeback, with shares rallying 34% over the past three months. This surge follows the significant dip in its share price triggered by the global IT outage on July 19, 2024.\nCRWD stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry and the S&P 500 index\u2019s rise of 16.2% and 10%, respectively, in the past three months. It has also fared better than other cybersecurity players, including Palo Alto Networks PANW, CyberArk Software CYBR and Check Point Software CHKP. Shares of Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk Software have soared 17.1% and 9.1%, respectively, while Check Point Software stock has declined 3.4% during the same time frame.\n3-Month Price Return Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis outperformance has made investors wonder if this is the right time to buy or hold CRWD stock and wait for more stability. Here\u2019s why maintaining a hold strategy could be the most prudent move.\nResilience in CRWD\u2019s Financial Performance Post Outage\nCrowdStrike\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company\u2019s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.\nThe company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm\u2019s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.\nThis robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike\u2019s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company\u2019s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation\nCrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.\nThe Falcon platform\u2019s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike\u2019s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Market Position and Customer Loyalty\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm\u2019s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.\nMoreover, the company's \u201cFalcon Flex\u201d subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.\nNavigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike\nDespite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company\u2019s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management\u2019s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.\nAnalysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPotential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike\u2019s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern\nCrowdStrike\u2019s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry\u2019s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now\nWhile CrowdStrike\u2019s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company is scheduled to release its earnings on November 26, 2024.

Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $982.26 million, indicating a 24.97% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nEarlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike\u2019s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn\u2019t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon\u2019s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.\nClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 6th on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.\nNow that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined\u00a0Catalysts\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.\nMcLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.\nMcLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to \u201cswitch course.\u201d\nOn the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined\u00a0Wealth!\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.\nDatta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.\nHe suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to \u201cpivot away\u201d from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.\nStory Continues\nAs the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Companies that no White House would get hung up on, either because they\u2019re beneath notice or they\u2019re perceived as good corporate citizens by both sides. Stocks in industries that neither Trump nor Harris have ever targeted in the past.\u201d\nHe also raised an important question for the viewers: \u201cIf you had the results of the election in hand, would you really know what to buy or sell?\u201d According to Cramer, answering that question is far more complicated than it seems. He emphasized his list of stocks that can thrive regardless of the election outcome. These are companies that have no clear political adversaries in Washington, making them relatively safe bets. Cramer acknowledged, however, that many stocks that seem like obvious picks for one candidate or another often have hidden dynamics that don\u2019t get enough attention.\n\u201cIn the end, this presidential prognostication game is meaningless until we start hearing about cabinet appointments, those will tell us a lot. Then, we can figure out really who the winners and losers are. Right now, though, there are just too many political angles to every single stock story.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 5. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCramer said that he is a\u00a0 big believer of cybersecurity, which is why his trust owns CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock.\n\u201cHey, speaking of hating to lose the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, that's Desh Aurora, and the CEO of CrowdStrike, that's George Kurtz, are both extremely competitive. They know how to stop cybercrime better than anyone. I know it hurts our diversification efforts, but the Charitable Trust owns both these stocks because I'm a huge believer in cybersecurity and I'm not gonna be left behind by a great stock here. There's so much crime happening online. These companies literally can't handle all the business. Imagine that, I call that a high-quality problem.\u201d\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) offers cybersecurity solutions. It is known for its Falcon platform, a comprehensive suite of endpoint security solutions. Despite facing challenges earlier this year due to an outage that temporarily impacted its reputation, the company continues to be regarded as a top player in its field. During the fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings call, which ended on July 31, CEO George Kurtz acknowledged that the outage caused some prospective customers to delay signing contracts.\nHowever, he emphasized that most of these deals remain active in the sales pipeline, indicating that the company\u2019s position in the market is still strong. Its Falcon platform offers a wide range of security tools, with 28 modules available to customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, 65% of its customers were using at least five of these modules. The number of deals involving eight or more modules saw a significant increase, up 66% compared to the same period last year.\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) uses generative AI to detect threats and respond to potential breaches more rapidly. The company claims to have \"the industry's most complete AI-native defense,\" positioning its technology as highly advanced. Its AI models are trained on data from more than 2 trillion incidents every day, enabling them to continually improve in terms of both speed and accuracy. This sophisticated approach to threat detection is central to the company\u2019s value proposition and has helped maintain its reputation as a leader in endpoint security.\nOverall CRWD ranks 5th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks that can do well regardless of who wins. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news.\nCNBC\u2019s Deidre Bosa joined \u2018Money Movers\u2019 to discuss the potential impact of a second Trump administration on the artificial intelligence trade. Bosa notes that artificial intelligence could be \u201cless regulated\u201d and \u201cmore volatile\u201d under Trump's leadership. However, the president-elect\u2019s AI policy could be a boon to the industry itself, albeit at the expense of necessary guardrails for AI. Back in June, Republicans adopted a new party platform containing a provision related to scrapping Biden\u2019s executive orders on AI.\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss and\u00a015 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nBiden\u2019s executive orders sought to tackle new technology threats by requiring developers of powerful AI systems to share their safety test results with the US government and also called on federal agencies to develop guidelines for the responsible use of AI domains. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s allies have been proposing a different executive order that would launch a series of \u201cManhattan Projects\u201d for developing military technology and immediately review \u201cunnecessary and burdensome regulations\u201d to \u201cMake America Great in AI\u201d.\nTrump, however, seems to be only one of the few who thinks imposing guardrails on artificial intelligence could prove detrimental to the US. A poll shared with Time reveals that Americans across the political spectrum are skeptical about the idea that the U.S. should avoid regulating AI to outcompete China. According to a poll by the AI Policy Institute (AIPI), 75% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans believe that \u201ctaking a careful controlled approach\u201d to AI is preferable as opposed to \u201cmoving forward on AI as fast as possible to be the first country to get extremely powerful AI.\u201d\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAmid the ongoing debate, recent developments in AI are rapidly shaping the landscape in the backdrop. For instance, Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine, is said to be raising new investment that would value the search startup to a staggering $9 billion. The new funding round is set to raise $500 million led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which also holds a board seat in the startup.\nIn other news, OpenAI, an AI research lab and company, has acquired Chat.com, further adding to its collection of high-profile domain names. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the acquisition via email. While such AI-related news is often striking, AI capabilities continue to surprise even the most seasoned experts. In fact, AI can now even help you become a better parent. On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz's partner Justine Moore took to X to share an investment idea, advocating for \"a new wave of 'parenting co-pilots' powered by LLMs and agents. She highlighted companies such as Cradlewise, creators of an AI-driven baby monitor that tracks sleep patterns and rocks the crib, and Nanit, which utilizes AI to analyze crib footage and monitor a baby's breathing.\nStory Continues\n\u201cImagine an AI parenting companion that\u2019s always in your corner \u2013 ready to answer questions or talk about how you\u2019re feeling at any time of the day (or night)\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves.\nAccording to the \"Hyperscale Data Centers - Global Strategic Business Report\", the global market for hyperscale data centers is estimated to reach US$730.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 23.1% from 2023 to 2030. From the increasing adoption of cloud services to the rise of big data and artificial intelligence, several factors are at play when it comes to its rapid growth. As per the report, the biggest driver is cloud computing, with more and more companies migrating their workloads to the cloud to reduce costs, improve scalability, and enhance flexibility.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\u00a0and\u00a08 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now\nThese hyperscalers need a lot of energy to run their data centers around the clock. According to McKinsey & Company, data center power needs are expected to grow three times higher than the current capacity by the end of the decade, from between 3 and 4 percent of total US power demand today to between 11 and 12 percent in 2030. Naturally, the power sector has become a significant AI player. Several technology companies are looking at nuclear power, including the use of small modular reactors (SMR), to meet their electricity needs.\n\u201cDriven by recent trends in AI development, projected power consumption by data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase in the range from 8% to 17% by 2030\u2014or potentially even higher, as progress in AI technologies is not linear but exponential, as seen in Silicon Valley today\u201d.\nRecent AI News\nAs the demand for advanced computing power grows, the latest AI breakthroughs are reshaping industries and driving innovation at an unprecedented pace. Then again, nothing is perfect. A few days back, OpenAI\u2019s premier chatbot, ChatGPT, went down for a total of 30 minutes. According to an outage tracking website Downdetector, over 19,000 people were impacted due to the chatbot\u2019s unavailability. Sam Altman, the CEO, admitted to the outage on X and apologized.\nThe same company is said to be hitting stumbling blocks recently. That\u2019s because, according to Bloomberg, its latest model Orion hasn\u2019t been performing as well as the developers had hoped for. OpenAI, however, isn\u2019t the only company seemingly facing a plateau. Three leading AI companies are now seeing diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build newer models.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, search habits are changing across the globe now that artificial intelligence is here. According to research from Yext, a digital presence platform for multi-location brands, 45% of customers are likely to use and trust an AI tool for finding more information about a brand, while 51% now use social media, and 28% turn to voice assistants.\n\u201cGoogle impressions have dropped 8-20% in the past two years, pushing marketers to adapt as search behaviour shifts with AI-driven overviews, chatbots and social media searches. Instagram and TikTok have become favoured alternative search engines, particularly for younger consumers\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nMarket Capitalization: $823.05 billion\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. It designs chips for companies that are building AI data centers.\nOn November 12, Citi analyst Christopher Danely noted that recent earnings saw semiconductor consensus estimates dropping by 11% while the SOX index, which measures semiconductor stocks, fell by 9%. The declines largely come from Microchip, NXP Semiconductors, and Intel; but the firm believes that the selloff is \u201calmost over and attention will shift to 2025\u201d. Citi further states that industrial market struggles will end sometime in the first half of 2025. Since 75% of semiconductor demand looks solid, investors should start investing more in them going into Q1. One of its Buy-rated names is Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). Broadcom has also been deemed an important stock by Jefferies analysts, who expect outperformance from it later in 2025.\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that should not be ignored.\nArtificial Intelligence is driving an unprecedented expansion in the potential market size for hardware and software products. According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the \u201cCNBC Connect\u201d event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI\u2019s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology.\n\u201cThree years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you\u201d.\nREAD ALSO: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 8 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now\nLatest Developments in AI\nLet\u2019s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported.\nIn other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation\u2019s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC\u2019s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation.\nStory Continues\nSpeaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training\u2014the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures\u2014have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring \u201ctest-time compute,\u201d a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called \u201cinference\u201d phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia\u2019s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

According to Curtis, the AI accelerator market will grow by 58% a year from $47 billion in 2023 to $287 billion in 2027. Moreover, there isn\u2019t a sign of a CapEx spending slowdown from the major technology companies as well. While Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 69.19%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology powerhouse known for its expertise in semiconductor design, development, and supply, alongside its enterprise software and security solutions. The company\u2019s cybersecurity portfolio includes a range of products, such as its Symantec Enterprise Cloud platform, as well as solutions for payment, mainframe, network, endpoint, and identity security.\nIn the third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, marking a 47% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and solid non-AI semiconductor performance. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects its AI revenue to rise 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the total for the year to $12 billion, primarily fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOn November 5, BofA reaffirmed its Buy rating on AVGO, citing the company's leadership in AI computing and networking, along with its strong free cash flow. However, the bank lowered its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast due to seasonal challenges, particularly stemming from a product transition with Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) that is expected to affect revenue in the first half of the year. Still, Broadcom\u2019s position is expected to be buoyed by new AI and networking contracts, along with further opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to adjusted earnings per share of $7.31 by 2026. As AI adoption continues to grow, Broadcom\u2019s focus on high-performance AI networking solutions, especially in complement to NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell architecture, could potentially strengthen its future prospects.\nOverall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other UBS\u2019 top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors.\nWith the third quarter of the 2024 earnings season underway, Wall Street is dealing with a changing stock market environment. The Federal Reserve has started its interest rate reduction cycle and market watchers are on the lookout for labor market and inflationary indicators to determine whether the Fed will be able to meet its goal of reducing interest rates by an additional 50 basis points by the end of this year.\nSimultaneously, the shifting economic climate is also creating changes in the investment environment. High interest rates traditionally do not mean well for certain stock market sectors barring exceptional circumstances. Some sectors that don\u2019t perform well in a high-rate environment include real estate, healthcare, and technology.\nFor two of these, this has been the case in the 2022 \u2013 2024 Federal Reserve interest rate hiking cycle as well. Starting from real estate, the flagship S&P index\u2019s real estate sector\u2019s annualized three-year return is currently -2.66%. From its peak of 324.75 in December 2021, the index has lost 48.2 points or 14.8%. Similarly, the high-end healthcare and biotechnology sector does not fare well during high interest rates either. Since 2021\u2019s close, the S&P\u2019s pharmaceutical stock index is down by -0.84% while the S&P\u2019s biotechnology index has lost a sizable 12.61%.\nThis brings us to our third stock market sector, a.k.a, technology. Technology, as you\u2019re likely aware, has seen a lot of investor interest due to the surge in artificial intelligence. Looking at the performance of the S&P\u2019s technology stock index, its performance also mirrors real estate and healthcare stocks before the frenzy around artificial intelligence started. Between 2021\u2019s close and the market\u2019s bottom in October 2022, the index had lost 33%. During the same time period, the real estate, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology stock indexes had lost 34.8%, 12.2%, and 30.5%, respectively. However, market optimism surrounding artificial intelligence has created a clear bifurcation in performance.\nAs an example, while real estate stocks have gained 29% since the October 2022 bottom and biotechnology stocks have added 25% in value, information technology stocks are up by a whopping 115%. This shows that tech stocks have delivered 4x the returns of both real estate and biotechnology. Driving this is artificial intelligence, with the shares of the world\u2019s premier AI GPU designer up by\u00a0690%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nStory Continues\nLooking at these shifts, the next question to ask is which stock market sectors might benefit from the evolving environment moving forward. On this front, investment bank UBS has some insights. In its Equity Compass Report issued in mid-October, the bank identifies key themes and trends for US and global stock markets. Within global and US stock market sectors, the bank has rated only one sector as \u2018Most Attractive\u2019. Unsurprisingly, this is the US technology sector which is currently experiencing a sustained surge of investor optimism courtesy of artificial intelligence.\nThe bank shares several data points to justify its optimism in the US technology sector, and more specifically, artificial intelligence companies. Citing data from the Hugging Face repository, a collection of software development tools, it reveals \u201can average 200% y/y rise for new AI models and model downloads combined so far in 2024.\u201d UBS is also optimistic about the growing adoption of artificial intelligence in the US business world. AI adoption is key since big technology firms that have invested billions of dollars in AI need it to generate returns on their investment.\nAs per UBS, data from the Census Bureau\u2019s Business Trends and Outlook (BTOS) survey released in September 2024 shows that AI adoption across the 1.2 million firms tracked was picking up the pace. \u201cIn the survey, 5.9% of companies reported using AI as of 3Q24, up from 3.7% in 3Q23,\u201d outlined the bank in its report. Not only did 5.9% of the firms adopt AI, but the survey\u2019s outlook for the next six months revealed that AI adoption across the surveyed population could rise by 2.8 percentage points to sit at 8.7%. Commenting on the implications of the higher adoption, UBS stated that \u201cincreasing future adoption will increase visibility on AI monetization, which is consistent with recent comments from leading cloud platforms.\u201d The firms slated to benefit the most from this monetization are those \u201d with strong footprints in existing customer bases,\u201d believes the bank.\nThese statements necessitate asking the question of\u00a0which\u00a0industries are slated to benefit the most from AI adoption. Fortunately for us, UBS also shares data for the industries currently leading the way with AI adoption and those that could grow adoption in the future. Right now, the information technology and personal services sectors are leading with AI adoption since as of September 2024, their respective adoption percentages were 19.1% and 14.7%. For the next six months, while the same industries are expected to lead the pack in overall AI adoption through their 23% and 19.8% percentages, others are expected to make higher percentage point gains. Two industries that stand out in the report are educational services and the finance and insurance industries.\nAs per the report, the former is expected to increase its AI adoption by 5.6 percentage points to 18.7% over the next six months from the current value of 13.1%. For the finance and insurance sector, it is expected to mark a 6.2 percentage point jump to 13.4% from the existing AI adoption of 7.2%. Of course, while AI is by far the most popular sector in the market right now, UBS also shares other attractive areas. It outlines that the market \u201calso offers exposure to secular growth in longevity through various US medical device companies. Many US companies are also playing leading roles in the energy transition via electric vehicles, renewables, and energy efficiency.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of UBS stocks with improving quantitative indicators, we chose the firm\u2019s top stocks that are seeing improvements in EPS growth, P/E ratio, and other indicators. Stocks within each sector were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. The sectors themselves were ranked by the cumulative number of funds invested in the firms.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 130\nSector: Information Technology\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. The firm operates in the hardware and software industries. Its key strengths lie on the former front, with Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) responsible for providing networking and custom chips for a wide variety of use cases. These provide the firm with large customers like Apple and have enabled it to establish a foothold in the AI industry. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) benefits from AI through its custom chips, and word on the street is that the firm has partnered up with OpenAI to develop a custom chip. Yet, reliance on customers like Apple is a double-edged sword as it also exposes Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to revenue losses in case its customers decide to develop custom chips. On the software front, the firm\u2019s VMWare acquisition has enabled it to sizably grow its revenue and could lead to further tailwinds in the future.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc.\u00a0is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of UBS\u2019 top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher.\nKen Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory.\nUnder Fisher\u2019s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times\u2019 list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis\nUnderstanding Bull Markets and the Role of Technology in Investment Strategies\nKen Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm\u2019s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic.\nFisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns.\nKen Fisher Predicts Shift as Value Stocks Begin to Outperform Growth Amid Fed Rate Speculations\nKen Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cAs 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn\u2019t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that\u2019s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.\u201d\nAdditionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources.\nAs short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year.\nOur Methodology\nThis article explores the top ten stock holdings of Fisher Asset Management, based on 13F filings as of Q2 2024.

The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.\nNow that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined\u00a0Catalysts\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.\nMcLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.\nMcLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to \u201cswitch course.\u201d\nOn the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined\u00a0Wealth!\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.\nDatta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.\nHe suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to \u201cpivot away\u201d from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.\nStory Continues\nAs the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\nThe company has been performing exceptionally throughout the year, having launched breakthrough technologies that facilitate the management of large datasets for AI tasks and scalable AI systems. Fast forward to November 5th, the company unveiled VeloRAIN, a platform that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the performance of AI security workloads. On the same day, the company\u2019s VMware Cloud Foundation unveiled a private cloud platform to improve customers\u2019 AI autonomy and security.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially to $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion, driven by ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers. Overall, consolidated revenue and net income grew by 47% and 44%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024, driven by growing AI revenue and VMware bookings.\nBroadcom Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as it leverages artificial intelligence. In addition to that, company officials believe AVGO is finally achieving stability on a company-wide level and is on track to becoming an AI powerhouse.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc.

We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 5th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nThe Calculation\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$29.8b\nUS$35.2b\nUS$40.8b\nUS$44.1b\nUS$46.7b\nUS$49.0b\nUS$51.1b\nUS$53.0b\nUS$54.8b\nUS$56.5b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x13\nAnalyst x8\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ 5.85%\nEst @ 4.88%\nEst @ 4.20%\nEst @ 3.73%\nEst @ 3.39%\nEst @ 3.16%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3%\nUS$27.5k\nUS$30.0k\nUS$32.1k\nUS$32.1k\nUS$31.4k\nUS$30.4k\nUS$29.2k\nUS$28.0k\nUS$26.7k\nUS$25.5k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$293b\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$56b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (8.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$1.0t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.0t\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$460b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$753b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$184, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Discounted Cash Flow November 11th 2024\nImportant Assumptions\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Broadcom as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.378. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for Broadcom\nStrength\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.\nThreat\nDividends are not covered by earnings.\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nNext Steps:\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "whole_article": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nHow ServiceNow Inc (NOW)\u2019s AI Partnerships Are Driving Its Soaring Growth: Insights from Jim Cramer\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia\u2019s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.\nThis partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.\nFor the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%. The company also expects a gross profit margin of 84.5% for its subscription services, with an operating income margin of 29.5% and a free cash flow margin of 31%.\nOverall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013November 15, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Toast TOST, as the Bull of the Day and Clean Harbors CLH, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nToast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.\nThe stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock\u2019s ongoing upward momentum.\nAbout the Company\nToast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.\nWith its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.\nIts platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.\nToast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of \u201cA\u201d in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a \u201cF\u201d in Value.\nQ3 Earnings Beat\nOn November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.\nQ3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.\nThe company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.\nGross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.\nManagement comments were overwhelmingly bullish:\n\u201cToast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.\u201d\nEstimates Headed Higher\nAnalysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.\nStory Continues\nFor the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.\nFor the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.\nFor the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.\nToast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote\nWith the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.\nJPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.\nThe Technical Take\nThe stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO\u2019d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.\nAfter trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.\nWith the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.\nPost earnings low: $36\nGap fill: $33\n21-day: $32\n50-day: $29.20\n200-day: $25.20\nFibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32\nWhile that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.\nIn Summary\nToast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.\nThe company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.\nAs Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.\nBear of the Day:\nClean Harbors \u00a0is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.\nThe company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?\nWith an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.\nAbout the Company\nClean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).\nThe company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world\u2019s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.\nCLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cD\u201d in Value, But \u201cB\u201d in both Momentum and Growth.\nQ3 Earnings\nThe company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.\nDespite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.\nPositive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.\nWhile there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.\nEarnings Estimates\nEstimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.\nFor the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.\nLooking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.\nFor the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year\u2019s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.\nTechnical Take\nThe drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.\nThis volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.\nThe drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.\nThe stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.\nIn Summary\nClean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.\nWith significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.\nAdditional content:\nServiceNow Expands Generative AI Offerings: Is the Stock a Buy?\nServiceNow\u00a0is adding Generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to the Now platform to foster responsible AI. NOW is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio, including new, expanded Now Assist capabilities with an AI Governance feature for secure and compliant AI practices.\nNOW\u2019s expanding GenAI portfolio and rich partner base have been driving top-line growth.

The free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, subscription revenues are projected between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 21.5-22% on a GAAP basis. At cc, subscription revenues are expected to grow at 20.5%.\nCurrent Remaining Performance Obligation is expected to grow 21.5% year over year on both non-GAAP and GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% for the current quarter.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $13.87 per share, up 0.4% over the past 30 days, indicating a 28.66% year-over-year increase.\nServiceNow, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ServiceNow, Inc. Quote\nThe consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.\nStrong Portfolio Aids NOW\u2019s Prospects\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.\nServiceNow\u2019s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.\nThe Xanadu update adds the latest AI capabilities to boost customer agility, enhance productivity and improve employee experiences.

This service will be available this November for Customer Service Management AI Agents and IT Service Management AI Agents. It is expected to reduce the time to resolve an issue and make live agents more productive.\nStrong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive\nA strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nNOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.\nThe strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.\nIn third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.\nNOW\u2019s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation\nHowever, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector\u2019s 6.37X.\nWe believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow\u2019s premium valuation.\nConclusion\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.\nServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "whole_article": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in NOW?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow.

        "whole_article": "Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.\nInsiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nNYSE:NOW Insider Trading Volume November 14th 2024\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of ServiceNow\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?\nInsiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps digitize and unify organizations so that they can find smarter, faster, better ways to make work flow.\nOn November 12, Wells Fargo raised the firm\u2019s price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $1,150 from $1,050 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares. According to the firm, ServiceNow is among the few companies that are demonstrating tangible AI monetization, i.e. they are really making money from AI. One of the key catalysts that will drive this momentum forward is the launch of its CSM/ITSM agents in Xanadu on November 24. The launch is a major step for the company in enhancing its AI-led customer service offerings. Finally, Wells Fargo expects ServiceNow to take the lead in AI customer service.\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet.

Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them.

But party on until we see damage; that\u2019s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.\u201d\nCramer said the market is still \u201coversold\u201d as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground. However, Cramer said the polls were again proved wrong.\nCramer then talked about the stocks that investors can buy to ride the Trump rally.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks.\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Cramer and picked stocks he believes can go higher under the Trump presidency. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nJim Cramer\u2019s New Price Target on ServiceNow (NOW): $1200\nCopyright: melpomen / 123RF Stock Photo\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 97\nA caller recently told Jim Cramer how he bought ServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0after Cramer\u2019s recommendation and bagged some profits. Cramer commented:\nStory Continues\n\u201cNew price target. I\u2019m going to say the stock goes to 1200. It is at 994, it is going to 1200. It is probably one of the best stocks in this entire market to buy. You have my blessing to keep it until $1200.\u201d\nServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0impressed the market with strong Q3 results. But can the stock keep going higher? ServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0recently launched its Now Platform Xanadu, adding more than 350 out-of-the-box generative AI capabilities to Now Assist. These features include data visualization automation, chat- and email-reply generation, change summaries, and LLM-based proactive prompts in Virtual Agent.\nServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0also released RaptorDB Pro, a high-performance database enabling customers to centralize operational data and analytics onto ServiceNow platforms. These platforms are expanding the company\u2019s abilities in the IT market.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) bulls believe the company\u2019s organic revenue growth after fiscal 2025 could clock in between 20% to 22%. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) can also expand its margins by 250bps annually, driven by 100bps from gross profits, 100bps from R&D reductions, and 50bps from SG&A leverage.\nNOW will also benefit from organic growth catalysts. Grand View Research predicts that the global information technology service management (ITSM) market will grow at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030.\nOverall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "whole_article": "ServiceNow Customer Service Management and Five9 Intelligent CX Platform to streamline self-service and assisted service operations\nIntegrated solution to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction\nTORONTO & BARCELONA, Spain, November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow World Forum & Five9 CX Summit\u2014ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, and Five9 (NASDAQ: FIVN), provider of the Intelligent CX Platform, today announced an expanded partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified end-to-end employee and customer experiences. By combining the strengths of ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) and the Five9 platform, the solution will create more streamlined self-service and assisted service operations and unify customer support processes to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and simplify contact center operations.\n\"Organizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together,\" said John Ball, senior vice president, Customer and Industry Workflows at ServiceNow. \"ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self-service and assisted service across voice and digital channels. Our expanded partnership with Five9 takes this even further, combining the best of both platforms to streamline and unify contact center operations with a turnkey solution that\u2019s fast to deploy and delivers fast ROI.\"\n\"Five9\u2019s longstanding partnership with ServiceNow has been rooted in the joint mission to create seamless and powerful end-to-end customer experiences,\" said Callan Schebella, executive vice president, product management, Five9. \"This next phase of our partnership transforms the approach to customer experience management, alleviating a lot of the frustrations that come with using multiple systems to address customer needs. We\u2019ve taken a big step forward to empower customers with our joint AI capabilities and improved interface functionality, easing the day-to-day challenges of customer-facing service.\"\n\"Combining the most valuable features into a unified interface can transform the way we support our customers,\" said Bob Massengill, senior director, Technology Infrastructure, Pilot Travel Centers, LLC. \"This new ServiceNow-Five9 joint solution has the potential to enable us to address customer needs more quickly and effectively.\"\nStory Continues\nThe new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.\nReal-time Transcription \u2013 Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents\u2019 work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.\nUnified Routing \u2013 Five9\u2019s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9. This reduces operational overhead for managers through streamlined routing management across both systems, making it easier to adjust staffing during high-demand periods. It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.\nSingle Agent Experience \u2013 Native Call Controls within ServiceNow\u2019s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer\u2019s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.\nAvailability\nThe ServiceNow and Five9 integrated capabilities are expected to be available to select customers in the first half of 2025.\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

With this launch, ServiceNow is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio for customers. This includes new, expanded Now Assist capabilities that drive greater visibility and controls with an AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices. Native multilingual support in Now Assist extends GenAI\u2019s global footprint for seamless, culturally aware communications and translations. Finally, purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety.\nAs enterprises have accelerated the adoption of GenAI, they are discovering that siloed applications and scattered data are barriers to impact and that establishing clearly defined, human-centric governance processes are essential to the effective use and oversight of GenAI. That\u2019s why ServiceNow delivers a winning combination of one platform with an integrated data layer and continues to optimize its AI platform for speed, scale, and security. The single architecture of the Now Platform helps ensure strong governance is embedded in its Now Assist GenAI solutions, models, and agents no matter where they are deployed in an organization.\n\"Enterprises across every industry are embracing a future of greater autonomy and productivity, all in service to their employees, customers, and overall business impact,\" said Jon Sigler, senior vice president of Platform and AI at ServiceNow. \"The ServiceNow platform was built to empower this transformation, offering smarter, faster ways of working through AI-enabled automation. With governance at the core, these new innovations bring more personalized, collaborative, trusted experiences to life across the enterprise.\"\nElevating customer trust with integrated AI governance\nTeams working with AI are often burdened with siloed tools and systems, making visibility and AI governance difficult. AI governance requires the integration of complex business processes and needs a best-of-breed workflow platform to be implemented successfully. With a unified AI inventory data model for connecting AI strategy, technology, security, and compliance to operate as an AI control tower, and expanded oversight for AI Governance for Now Assist, ServiceNow is laying a foundation to help customers build trust while accelerating business transformation.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also introduced new Now Assist capabilities that empower customers with the tools needed for responsible AI use:\nNow Assist Guardian provides built-in monitoring and responsible AI guardrails so customers can better control the use of GenAI on the Now Platform. This includes the management and mitigation of offensive content, security vulnerabilities, and the exposure of sensitive information.\nNow Assist Data Kit eases the often-cumbersome task of managing and consuming data for AI use cases. Users can create and easily manage datasets for AI skills and applications, develop ground truth datasets to benchmark for accuracy and help predict AI outcomes, and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of experiences built with Now Assist Skill Kit.\nNow Assist Analytics offers greater visibility into the adoption, usage, and performance of Now Assist across the enterprise. With these insights, customers can make more informed, data-driven decisions to advance GenAI adoption, evaluate ROI on GenAI investments, and enable better business outcomes.\nExtending the value and impact of GenAI globally\nWith today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow is adding new built-in multilingual features to Now Assist. These new features address customer demand and expand the application of ServiceNow\u2019s GenAI solutions in global markets. Now Assist can now generate, summarize, and respond to GenAI prompts in the user\u2019s native language, providing improved, culturally aware understanding and communication for both agents and requestors.\nThe following languages are supported natively by Now Assist: English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese. Other languages will continue to be supported with ServiceNow\u2019s existing Dynamic Translation, which automatically translates user inputs and a response back in the user\u2019s language.\nAccelerating productivity with tailored Now Assist solutions\nBuilding on the Xanadu platform release\u2014which marked the company\u2019s most comprehensive set of AI innovations to date\u2014ServiceNow has further expanded Now Assist solutions, purpose-built for specific enterprise use cases. From configuration management to legal affairs and health and safety, GenAI can help transform the productivity and efficacy of these critical internal functions.\nNow Assist for Configuration Management Database (CMDB) uses AI to make managing and understanding data easier for customers. It helps users keep a clean and accurate CMDB by reducing duplicate data, simplifying complex information, and streamlining data input. With Now Assist for CMDB, users can quickly view summaries of Configuration Items (CIs) and their dependencies, and AI can find and fix duplicate data automatically. It also assists in the setup of Service Graph Connectors to bring data into the CMDB and fix any issues that come up during the process.\nNow Assist for Legal Service Delivery helps legal teams deliver faster service to clients with auto-generated summaries of legal requests and matters. Legal teams are often juggling multiple requests and complex legal matters, such as investigations, simultaneously. With Now Assist, they can fulfill these requests with greater efficiency and faster time to resolution.\nNow Assist in Contract Management streamlines contract processing and reduces risk by leveraging GenAI to automatically flag non-standard language, identify missing clauses and suggest revisions within contracts such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Additionally, GenAI provides rapid insights into contractual terms and obligations by intelligently extracting metadata from contracts. This helps reduce cost, revenue leakage, and risk for the enterprise.\nNow Assist for Health and Safety helps ensure a safer environment for employees by streamlining incident management processes while reducing manual, repetitive work for health and safety workers. It uses GenAI to auto-generate summaries of safety incidents and lessons learned based on incident records, resulting in more effective communication, improved agent productivity, and proactive prevention and resolution of incidents.\nIn addition to these new innovations, ServiceNow Impact\u2014the ServiceNow customer success solution to maximize AI, optimize performance, provide on-demand expertise, and accelerate business value\u2014includes new GenAI accelerators to help make adoption of Now Assist solutions easier and faster for customers.\n\"Worldwide spending on AI is projected to grow 3 times greater than the five-year CAGR for worldwide IT spending over the same period (2023-2028), driven by the rapid infusion of AI and GenAI for employee experience, customer engagement, business processes, and industry innovation,\" said Ritu Jyoti, general manager/group VP, AI, and Data market research and advisory at IDC. \"As organizations look to drive value from AI transformations, they recognize the need for a single and scalable platform that connects people, processes, data, and systems. ServiceNow is meeting customers where they are by streamlining workflows and simplifying complex processes on a single AI-powered platform. As ServiceNow expands GenAI into new areas of the enterprise, the company continues to help organizations transform operations and stay competitive.\"\nCustomers like EY are already seeing the benefits of Now Assist.\n\"GenAI is having a huge impact on our organization, both in the way EY teams deliver EY services and support EY people, but also in creating opportunities to go to market with ServiceNow to help EY clients transform their businesses,\" said Hank Prybylski, Global Vice Chair, Transformation, EY. \"We are seeing incredible value in the Now Assist space and looking to extend that to a whole suite of areas including customer service management and more broadly to our managed services environment.\"\nPutting data and AI to work across the Now Platform\nOn top of today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow recently announced Workflow Data Fabric, a breakthrough innovation that enhances all ServiceNow workflows, AI solutions, and AI Agents.\nThis enhanced, integrated data layer allows customers to connect, understand, and act on structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data across the enterprise, inside and outside of ServiceNow. Coupled with zero copy capabilities and the future integration of Knowledge Graph, which transforms raw data into contextual insights, ServiceNow is unifying people, processes, operations, and systems so AI can work more autonomously across the enterprise.\nThese data capabilities are an instrumental part of ServiceNow's vision of AI Agents that work autonomously and collaboratively with people to enable business transformation. This vision also includes the expansion of its partnership with NVIDIA to jointly develop AI agent use cases on the Now Platform and accelerate the adoption of Agentic AI, reinventing how AI delivers value across all industries.\nAvailability\nAI Governance for Now Assist is available today to a limited set of customers and is expected to be generally available in Q1 2025. All other new GenAI innovations announced today are now generally available to customers in the ServiceNow Store.\nAdditional Information\nLearn more about ServiceNow Now Assist here.\nRead about additional news from ServiceNow today:\nNew innovations enhance developer productivity, industry momentum\nServiceNow and Five9 expand partnership to deliver unified, end-to-end agent and customer experiences\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

Businesses use ServiceNow's AI-backed products to automate and manage their IT processes and reduce costs.\nLast month, ServiceNow unveiled a fourth-quarter subscription revenue forecast that topped Wall Street expectations.\nThe firm, which has been rolling out new AI-enhanced offerings to its enterprise clients such as ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and video conferencing service Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), also increased its full-year subscription revenue outlook thanks to solid demand from new and existing customers.\nMeanwhile, ServiceNow's rival Salesforce has yet to show enough evidence its own AI offering will be enough to return growth to double-digits in the near term, the Wells Fargo analysts said.\nIn August, the software-as-a-service pioneer reported better-than-anticipated revenue of $9.33 billion in its second quarter and raised its annual profit outlook to a range of $10.03 to $10.11 per share, up from $9.86 to $9.94. But Salesforce's guidance for third-quarter revenue still missed expectations, exacerbating worries around a potential rebound in cloud spending.\nThe Wells Fargo analysts said they see more \"attractive opportunities\" in companies like ServiceNow that have already shown an ability to make money off of so-called generative AI. The setup for Salesforce heading into next is \"tough,\" they added.\nRelated Articles\nCloud software groups recovering heading into the end of 2024, Wells Fargo says\nNovavax cuts 2024 revenue forecast again on lower COVID vaccine sales\nTyson Foods beats quarterly results on strong demand for beef, pork\nView Comments"

        "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nServiceNow (NOW) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 6.7%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\nTechnology is a Big Deal, Strategist Highlights\nThe Magnificent Seven continues to grasp a sizeable market share of the market gains over the past few years. That said, investors and analysts are excited to see what this earnings period has to offer for the magnificent seven and how much of an influence they have on the market. On October 31, Christian Dery, head of macro strategy at Capital Fund Management, appeared in an interview\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the impact of the magnificent seven on the market.\nDery suggested that these companies have grown to become large entities and their market capitalization often fluctuates by $2 billion to $400 billion on earnings events. Looking at the dispersion of the index, Dery adds that individual stocks within the S&P are very diverse and more independent, hinting towards a very low correlation in the index.\nHe adds that generative AI and LLMs are very different from the traditional software business. Therefore, the hyperscaling model that is conventionally taken from software can not be applied here. For every new customer in the software business, the marginal cost often goes down to nearly zero. However, if you look at the \u201ctech incumbents\u201d, they have to increase their capital expenditures to develop compute clusters and scale their operations, suggests Dery.\nIn 2023, the chips industry generated revenue of about $3 billion, reflecting that we are yet to find a killer use case or see results of generous AI spending. Dery adds that the market is more likely to be \u201cdiscerning\u201d on the path to profitability since companies are going to focus more on capital expenditures and projections for capital expenditures. He is particularly interested in the CapEx projections of the Magnificent Seven and shares that if they miss there could be a negative reaction among those stocks.\nDery reiterated that the market is yet to see the investments pay off multiple times but maintains his interest in capital expenditures by these companies playing out. While he is bullish on technological innovation and believes artificial intelligence is disruptive and a \u201cbig deal\u201d, he fails to see viable results as of now. Dery also emphasizes that these companies are directing their investments to AI because they do not want to fall behind competitors, with no proper timeline for AI monetization.\nStory Continues\nThat said, some companies are investing heavily in innovation and are at the forefront of a technological revolution.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we went over multiple similar rankings on the internet from credible financial websites. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NOW)'s AI Innovations Drive Revenue Growth and Strategic Partnerships\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software company that helps companies manage digital workflows and operations using its cloud computing platform. The company\u2019s Now Platform allows businesses to leverage AI to enhance productivity, automate workflows, scale for growth, and improve security.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) generated $2.79 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from the same quarter in 2023. Of this, subscription revenue was worth $2.72 billion, representing a growth rate of 23%. The company attributes this momentum to customers doubling down on ServiceNow as a leading AI platform for operational efficacy and business transformation. The company itself is confident in its future performance as the demand for AI continues to grow.\nDuring the quarter, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) processed its largest AI release to date, the Now Platform Xanadu release. The release encompasses hundreds of new and improved AI capabilities and generative AI solutions for the telecom, media, technology, and financial services industries. In addition to that, the company also partnered with NVIDIA to co-develop AI agents using Nvidia\u2019s blueprints in the ServiceNow platform. To align with its expansion strategy, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) also forged separate partnerships with Siemens, Rimini Street, and Pearson to develop AI use cases for different industries and customer segments.\nOverall, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an investor favorite because of its quality deals with major players in the industry. Similarly, the company has high growth expectations for the full fiscal year and the fourth quarter of 2024, contributing to its ranking as one of the best innovative stocks according to hedge funds.\nIthaka Group\u2019\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFounded in 2004,\u00a0ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW) has become the leading provider of cloud-based software solutions that define, structure, manage and automate workflow services for global enterprises. ServiceNow pioneered the use of the cloud to deliver IT service management (\u201cITSM\u201d) applications. These applications allow users to manage incidents and to plan new IT projects, provision clouds, manage application performance and build applications themselves. The company has since expanded beyond the ITSM market to provide workflow solutions for IT operations management, customer support, human resources, security operations and other enterprise departments where a patchwork of semi-automated processes have been used with varying success in the past. ServiceNow\u2019s stock appreciated in the quarter on the back of strong earnings that beat Street estimates on the top and bottom line, with the company pointing to strength in subscription revenues, cRPO, operating margins, and continued demand for the company\u2019s AI products.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.
