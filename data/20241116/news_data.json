(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks on latest ratings and news.\nAI data centers and the power needed to keep them running are some of the hottest topics in the technology space. A new report by management consulting firm Gartner sheds expert light on the matter, AI and GenAI are driving rapid increases in electricity consumption, with data center forecasts over the next two years reaching as high as 160% growth. Gartner claims that 40% of existing AI data centers will be operationally constrained by power availability by 2027. Research from the company indicates that the power required for data centers to run incremental AI-optimized servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year in 2027, which is 2.6 times the level in 2023.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nBob Johnson, VP Analyst at Gartner, has said that the explosive growth of new hyperscale data centers to implement GenAI is creating an insatiable demand for power that will exceed the ability of utility providers to expand their capacity fast enough. In turn, per Johnson, this threatens to disrupt energy availability and lead to shortages, which will limit the growth of new data centers for GenAI and other uses from 2026. He added that short-term power shortages are likely to continue for years as new power transmission, distribution and generation capacity could take years to come online and won\u2019t alleviate current problems.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nWhat is the Metaverse?\nAccording to McKinsey & Company, the metaverse is the emerging 3-D-enabled digital space that uses virtual reality, augmented reality, and other advanced internet and semiconductor technology to allow people to have lifelike experiences online.\nThe basic features of the metaverse include a sense of immersion, real-time interactivity, and user agency. Whereas, the full vision of the metaverse encompasses platforms and devices that work seamlessly with each other, the possibility for thousands of people to interact simultaneously, and use cases well beyond gaming. While the phenomenon gained attention in 2021 with internet searches for the term increasing by 7,200%, it seems here to stay. With lockdowns and work-from-home policies in place, the interest in shared virtual environments spiked. The opportunity remains vast with metaverse having the potential to generate up to $5 trillion in value by 2030.\nIs the Metaverse Still Alive?\nWhen the tech guru Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook\u2019s name to Meta in 2021, he clearly drove the metaverse narrative in the world. Although the vision of a digital future of work and recreation became a buzz for a while, other emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence decided to dominate the headlines later.\nQuestions regarding whether Zuckerberg should have transformed a successful social media company into a VR venture have also been asked. In September 2023, BBC reported that his company\u2019s virtual and augmented reality branch, Reality Labs, has lost $21 billion since the prior year. The firm later introduced its social virtual reality space Horizon Worlds. While some users have complained about not having enough people to make it fun, the platform\u2019s monthly users can simply not match the number of people who consume social media like Facebook and Instagram every day.\nAlthough the company\u2019s virtual reality headset and its Horizon Worlds have not gone mainstream after 3 years of the company\u2019s founding, experts argue that the metaverse is still as relevant as ever. On October 2, CNBC reported that Zuckerberg\u2019s metaverse is finally showing signs of life as his company might have found its footing in VR and AR through a different medium, smart glasses. After the firm witnessed early success in the market for smart glasses via a partnership with Ray-Ban, the CEO unveiled the first \u201cfully-functioning\u201d prototype AR glasses, Orion, in September.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe right way to look at Orion is as a time machine. These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\u201d\nAlthough there might be a lack of connection between the metaverse which was the next big thing two years ago and the prevailing tech landscape dominated by AI, some argue that the reports of the metaverse\u2019s death are \u2018exaggerated\u2019 and that it is a rather long-term concept to materialize as a digital future for masses.\nWith that being said, let\u2019s move to the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies.

(NASDAQ:AMD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders:\u00a0108\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) serves as the high-performance and adaptive computing leader. The firm operates through multiple segments including Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded. For over 45 years, AMD has driven innovation in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies which serve as the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms, and the datacenter.\nThe chip maker made its way into the metaverse when it landed Meta as its customer and stated that Meta would use AMD\u2019s EPYC chips in its data centers. AMD further collaborated with Meta Platforms to make the metaverse a reality. Under this collaboration, AMD\u2019s radio chip Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC enabled the development of multiple Evenstar radio units to expand the 4G/5G global mobile network infrastructure. Additionally, AMD supplies chips to the leading gaming console makers such as Microsoft and Sony which engage in the virtual world. AMD chips power the PS5 and the Xbox Series X.\nAMD recorded Q3 revenue of $6.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by increased sales of EPYC and Instinct data center products and strong demand for Ryzen PC processors. While Record Data Center segment revenue of $3.5 billion was up 122% year-over-year, Client segment revenue was up 29% year-over-year. The firm is on track to deliver record annual revenue for 2024 based on significant growth in its Data Center and Client segments.\nWith the metaverse driving the demand for graphics cards and processors, AMD is in a good spot to reap the benefits.

As the initial euphoria of market participants is over, investors are assessing the pros and cons of Trump\u2019s economic policies, such as the imposition of tariffs, reduction of corporate taxes, deregulation of corporate America and their impact on inflation.\nThe technology sector is also concerned about Trump\u2019s tariffs on high-end chipsets, the future of the $52.5 billion Chips and Science Act and the imposition of antitrust regulations on big techs. Nevertheless, I believe that the AI frenzy will continue as this technology has become the need of the hour.\nAt this stage, we recommend five generative artificial intelligence (AI) behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank that have double-digit upside potential in the short term. These are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nAI Frenzy Remains Intact\nThe astonishing rally of U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative AI technology across the world was the prime factor.\nBloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending will increase from $67 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. UBS estimated that four U.S. technology giants that are member of the so-called \u201cmagnificent 7\u201d will spend around $267 billion as capital expenditure on AI applications in 2025, a jump of 33.5% year over year.\n5 AI Bigwigs to Buy With Double-Digit Short-Term Appreciation\nEach of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI (Gen AI) solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products. GOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance search results continue to boost traffic on GOOGL\u2019s search engine.\nStory Continues\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 17.6% from the last closing price of $175.58. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $185-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 36.7% and no downside.\nMeta Platforms Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Meta Platforms is set to receive initial shipments of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s (NVDA) new flagship AI chip later this year. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META is set to get B200 Blackwell chips.\nMETA\u2019s AI-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms. Management said that the company will invest $38-$40 billion as capital expenditure in AI initiatives in 2024. Moreover, capital spending is likely to reach more than $50 billion in 2025.\nOn July 24, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA\u2019s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbents like Open AI.\nStrong Price Upside Potential for META Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $577.16.

          "whole_article": "This earnings season may be winding down but there are still a number of big-name companies reporting in the coming week.\nAll eyes will be on chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), as investors eagerly await its latest quarterly results, to see if it can deliver another set of strong results as a gauge of the AI boom.\nInvestors will also be looking to see if US retailer Walmart (WMT) can deliver another set of results that beats Wall Street's expectations.\nMeanwhile, tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMB.L) is scheduled to release its full-year results, with investors hoping for another increase to its dividend.\nMarkets will be hoping that sportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) can maintain its full-year guidance when it reports in the coming week.\nInvestors will also be keeping a close eye on Royal-Mail-owner International Distribution Services (IDS.L), for any details in its results as to how its agreed takeover led by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky is progressing.\nHere's more on what to look out for:\nNvidia (NVDA) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Wednesday 20 November\nChipmaker Nvidia's latest quarterly results are set to draw much of the market focus this week, having become a bellweather for how the global push in AI is faring.\nNvidia will also round off earnings releases from the Magnificent 7 tech behemoths as the last of the group to report this season, with Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA), having already published results.\nThe demand for Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has continued to propel its shares higher, with the stock up 196% year-to-date. The recent rise in its shares pushed Nvidia to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.6tn (\u00a32.8tn).\nShares rose earlier this week after Nvidia said that Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) would be the first to receive its AI Blackwell chips.\nThis came as part of a series of collaborations with SoftBank that Nvidia announced on Tuesday.\nRead more: How Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote speech at the chipmaker's AI Summit in Japan, that SoftBank would be using its Blackwell platform to build Japan's most powerful AI supercomputer.\nIn addition, Nvidia also revealed that SoftBank, using the chipmaker's AI Aerial computing platform, had piloted the world's first combined AI and 5G telecom network.\nThe attention now turns to Nvidia's third-quarter results for its 2025 fiscal year, with the chipmaker having guided to revenue of $32.5bn, plus or minus 2%, for the period in its previous quarterly report.\nStory continues\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Markets forecasts expect that number to be a little higher. If NVIDIA continues its strong run of beating market expectations, things could be better still.\"\n\"There\u2019s likely to be more emphasis however on the outlook for the final three months of the year, where consensus is currently looking for revenue of $36.6bn.\"\nIn the second quarter, revenue came in at $30bn, which was 122% higher than the previous year. Nvidia posted earnings per diluted share of $0.67, which was up 168% on the previous year.\n\"Any steer as to how well the recently launched ultra-fast Blackwell chip is selling will also be closely scrutinised,\" Nathan said.\n\"There\u2019s no shortage of demand as the likes of Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) look to gain an edge in the AI race. But there remain some unanswered questions about Nvidia\u2019s supply chain\u2019s ability to keep pace.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nWalmart (WMT) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Tuesday 19 November\nWall Street will keeping an eye on retailer Walmart's latest results to see if it reports another solid quarter, as consumer price pressures persist.\nLatest data showed consumer prices grew by 2.6% in October, which was a slight uptick for the 2.4% rate of inflation recorded in September.\nThe figure was still above the US Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target but was in line with with expectations, sustaining investor hopes that the central bank will potentially cut interest rates again in December.\nHowever, there are concerns that potential policies around trade tariffs from president-elect Donald Trump, after he returns to the White House in January, could drive inflation higher.\nAs the world's largest retailer by sales, Walmart's results can provide an insight into US consumer sentiment.\nRead more: UK growth slows between July and September as services sector falters\nIn the second quarter, Walmart (WMT) logged revenue growth of 4.8% of $169.34bn, beating estimates of $168.46bn.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.67 also beat expectations of $0.65 and marked a 9.8% increase year-on-year.\nThis strong performance contributed to a 61% rise in Walmart shares year-to-date.\nCEO Doug McMillon said: \"Each part of our business is growing \u2013 store and club sales are up, e-commerce is compounding as we layer on pickup and even faster growth in delivery as our speed improves.\"\nFor the third quarter, Walmart guided to an increase of 3.25% to 4.25% in consolidated net sales, compared with the same period last year when it delivered $159.4bn in net sales.\nWalmart said it was expecting consolidated operating income to rise between 3% and 4.5% in the third quarter, up from $6.2bn last year.\nThe company expected adjusted earnings per share to come in at $0.51 to $0.52, compared with $0.51 for the third quarter last year.\n\u2022 USD\n(WMT)\nFollow\nView quote details\nImperial Brands (IMB.L) \u2014 Reports full-year results on Tuesday 19 November\nShares in tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMB.L) are currently trading at a five-year high, with the stock up 31% year-to-date.\nThat's despite the higher duties on cigarettes and vapes announced in the recent UK autumn budget.\n\"These moves add to a long list of regulatory and tax measures designed to deter consumers from smoking, after interventions on advertising and packaging design,\" said AJ Bell's Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth.\nEven so, the investment experts said that Imperial Brands continues to see strong profits and cash generation, much of which could be attributed to the five-year plan set out by CEO Stefan Bomhard, who took the reins in 2020.\nIn its full year results last year, Imperial Brands posted a 7.1% decline in tobacco volumes (excluding Russia), but the company raised its prices by an average of 11%. Sales in its next generation product segment rose 26%.\nRead more: Rachel Reeves hints at looser regulation in bid to improve UK's competitiveness\n\"Imperial will be looking to a similar recipe in the year to September 2024, for which chief executive Stefan Bomhard gave clear guidance alongside the full-year results for 2023 back in November,\" said Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth.\nIn its half-year results, Imperial Brands said it expected to deliver revenue growth in the low-single digits on a constant currency basis for its tobacco and next generation products segments.\nThe company forecast that adjusted operating profit would grow by close to the middle of its mid-single digit range.\nOn the back of this guidance, AJ Bell's investment experts said that analysts were expecting group adjusted operating profit of \u00a33.9bn, which would be flat on the previous year.\nAnalysts were also said to be expecting adjusted earnings per share of \u00a32.95, up from \u00a32.79 last year.\nIn terms of its dividend, Imperial Brands has produced three consecutive increases in the payout, with analysts said to be looking for another advance to \u00a31.53 per share in this set of results. The company also recently announced a further share buyback of \u00a31.25bn, which it is set to complete by the end of October 2025.\n\u2022 USD\n(IMB.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nJD Sports (JD.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter trading update on Thursday 21 November\nSportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) had a tougher start to its fiscal year but Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the situation has since picked up for the business. However, shares in the company are still down nearly 29% year-to-date.\nIn its interim results, JD Sports logged 5% growth in revenue to \u00a35.03bn, while profit before tax and adjusting items was up 2% to \u00a3405.6m.\n\"It was pleasing to see Europe, North America and Asia Pacific markets all posting double-digit sales growth,\" said Chiekrie. \"But the UK market remains challenging and volatile, and full-year profit guidance got a small downgrade as a result.\"\nHe said that JD Sports was trying to offset these challenges by \"tightening its belt and streamlining operations\".\nRead more: December UK interest rate cut unlikely despite GDP slowdown\n\"Investors will be hoping that means there won\u2019t be further downgrades to the full-year outlook in next week's results,\" he said.\nChiekrie said that investors would also be wanting to see how its takeover of US sporting goods supplier Hibbett is progressing, having completed the acquisition in July.\n\"The deal has substantially increased the group\u2019s footprint in the US, but there\u2019s a lot of work to do to make sure a deal of this size pulls in the expected benefits,\" he said.\nIn terms of its UK business, Andy Higginson, who is both chair of JD Sports and the British Retail Consortium, recently warned that tax rises on businesses announced in the autumn budget would result in prices to rise for shoppers.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the budget that employers would have to pay 15% in national insurance on salaries over \u00a35,000, rising from the current rate of 13.8% on salaries over \u00a39,100.\n\"I'm guaranteeing you today, if these go through as they are without any sort of feathering, we\u2019re going to see significant inflation in prices,\" Higginson said on the BBC's Today programme.\n\u2022 USD\n(JD.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nInternational Distribution Services (IDS.L) \u2014 Reports interim results on Thursday 21 November\nThe focus for investors in Royal Mail-owner International Distribution Services will be on the takeover of the company led by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.\nIDS agreed to the \u00a33.57bn takeover offer back in May, with the offer made through a special purpose vehicle, EP UK Bidco Limited, owned by J&T Capital Partners and EP Corporate Group. Kretinsky is the majority owner of EP Corporate Group.\nKeith Williams, the chair of IDS, said that the company's board had negotiated a \"far reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments which provide our customers, employees and broader stakeholders with important safeguards.\"\nRead more: What does the launch of pension megafunds mean for investors?\nMeanwhile, Kretinsky said: \"The EP Group has the utmost respect for Royal Mail's history and tradition, and I know that owning this business will come with enormous responsibility \u2013 not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day.\"\nIn terms of its company performance, IDS said that total parcels volumes were up 11% in its first quarter. Meanwhile, revenue across the IDS group had risen 8% to \u00a33.2bn.\nIn September, regulator Ofcom said it was considering changes to the UK postal service for Royal Mail. This included the potential scrapping of second class letter deliveries on Saturdays.\nHowever, a decision had not yet been made, with Ofcom saying it expected to consult on proposals for reform in early 2025, with a view to announcing a decision in summer 2025.\nIDS reportedly said that the \u201cchange cannot come soon enough\u201d to the UK postal service.\n\u2022 USD\n(IDS.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nOther companies reporting next week include:\nMonday 18 November\nBig Yellow (BYG.L)\nSirius Real Estate (SRE.L)\nTuesday 19 November\nDiploma (DPLM.L)\nAvon Protection (AVNBF)\nCML Microsystems (CML.L)\nRevolution Beauty (REVB.L)\nGB Group (GBG.L)\nGear4Music (G4M.L)\nXiaomi (1810.HK)\nSonova (SONVY)\nThyssenKrupp (TKA.DE)\nLowe\u2019s (LOW)\nMedtronic (MDT)\nDollar Tree (DLTR)\nAmer Sports (AS)\nDolby Laboratories (DLB)\nWednesday 20 November\nSage (SGE.L)\nMitchells & Butlers (MAB.L)\nTracsis (TRCS.L)\nRotork (ROR.L)\nSoftcat (SCT.L)\nBaloise (BALN.SW)\nSoitec (SLOIF)\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW)\nTarget (TGT)\nSnowflake (SNOW)\nNio (NIO)\nThursday 21 November\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\nGrainger (GRI.L)\nJet2 (JET2.L)\nMitie (MTO.L)\nSpeedy Hire (SDY.L)\nNorcros (NXR.L)\nWarehouse REIT (WHR.L)\nCrest Nicholson (CRST.L)\nBreedon (BREE.L)\nBaidu (BIDU)\nIntuit (INTU)\nPDD (PDD)\nWarner Music (WMG)\nGap (GAP)\nFriday 22 November\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\nMeituan (3690.HK)\nCathay Pacific Airways (CPCAF)\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\nRead more on stocks:\nTrending tickers: Tesla, Alibaba, Pfizer, Domino's and Disney\nFTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win\nHow Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nNYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nIn Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThere\u2019s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump\u2019s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.\nBut there\u2019s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate \u2014 especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect \u2014 and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.\nThese cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk\u2019s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up less than 1%, while Facebook parent Meta is down 0.6%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 3.5%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 2%.\nAs the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they\u2019re thinking about. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying:\nTiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:\n\u201cTariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.\nWe have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.\u201d\nMark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we\u2019ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.\nI don\u2019t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.\u201d\nMark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.\n\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she\u2019s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.\u201d\nThreats against Alphabet and Meta are \u201cjust talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn\u2019t take kindly to that. However, I don\u2019t think anything like this will make it into policy.\u201d\nKevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management\n\u201cTrump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn\u2019t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn\u2019t put him the best light.\nThe thing that\u2019s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That\u2019s a counter perspective to that. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren\u2019t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.\nI don\u2019t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined. I have exposure to Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple. I don\u2019t know how tariffs will impact Nvidia, since the demand will remain there no matter what. Broadcom goes kind of hand in hand with that. I think that at Apple, Cook will take steps to keep the products from exploding in price.\u201d\nAdam Grossman, chief investment officer of global equity at Riverfront Investment Group:\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unclear a week after the election. I do think he could get tariffs through on China, but getting tariffs through on Europe, that\u2019s another ball of wax.\nFor someone like Donald Trump, I think he\u2019s going to have enough other issues that they\u2019re going to kind of fly off of his radar.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nChinese tech conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering an offering of bonds totaling the equivalent of about $5 billion as soon as this month, people familiar with the matter said.\nElon Musk\u2019s social media platform X sued to block a California law aimed at curbing AI-generated deceptive election content on social media, claiming the measure is an unconstitutional affront to free speech.\nMeta Platforms Inc. said it intends to appeal court rulings allowing dozens of states and hundreds of school districts across the US to proceed with lawsuits blaming \u201caddictive\u201d social media apps for contributing to a mental health crisis among youths.\nSamsung Electronics Co. plans to buy back about 10 trillion won ($7.2 billion) of its own stock over the next year, putting in motion one of the larger shareholder return programs in its history.\nLenovo Group Ltd. hiked its projection for global PC shipments in 2025 after posting better-than-expected earnings, saying AI features will help boost growth next year.\nEarnings Due Friday\nPremarket\nAlibaba\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nCEOs Brace for the Chaos of Another Four Years of Trump\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nBetting on Tesla Helped Ron Baron Beat the Index.

According to a report published by Bloomberg, the startup has said that the US and neighboring countries should form a North American Compact for AI that can streamline access to talent, financing and supply chains for building out the technology.

The company further urged the US to establish AI Economic Zones that speed up the permitting process and help bring nuclear reactors back online. It also proposed expanding nuclear energy capacity by tapping the US Navy, which has built compact reactors to power submarines.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks you should pay attention to.\nAI initiatives by businesses across the world are attracting the attention of investors. For example, the latest developments come from Finland, where Nokia, a once powerful phone maker who has now shifted focus towards telecom equipment, recently announced that it had purchased an application programming interface (API) hub and marketplace from US company Rapid. The hub is the largest of its kind in the world and is part of a larger effort by the Finnish company to boost revenues from 5G deployments. 5G tech has been a key reason for AI growth in the past few years. 5G speeds allow faster processing of AI tasks on mobile devices.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAcross the pond, AI startup CoreWeave has secured more than $650 million in funding led by top names like Jane Street, Magnetar, Fidelity Management and Macquarie Capital. The startup specializes in providing cloud-based graphics processing unit (GPU) infrastructure to artificial intelligence developers. The company is now valued at more than $23 billion. In May this year, the firm was valued at $19 billion after a funding round led by investment firm Coatue that managed to raise over $1 billion. According to venture capital firm Accel, funding of AI and cloud companies in the US, Europe and Israel is estimated to hit $79.2 billion by the end of the year.\nREAD ALSO: 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "The deluge of goodbye messages from people leaving X began shortly after Donald Trump's election victory last week. In explaining their decision, many in the exodus cited the same thing: The huge support Elon Musk, the social media service's owner, gave the Republican candidate during the campaign and the increasing nastiness on his site.\nJody Avrigan, a podcast host and media producer with 50,000 followers on X, said on rival social media service Threads, that he was done using X, because \u201cElon Musk is a pretty destructive force in our society and politics, I want no part of him.\u201d Nicole Wallace, an anchor on MSNBC with over 1 million followers on X, said on live TV that she\u2019d \u201cdeleted Twitter today as an act of self preservation.\u201d Tee Wattress said on Threads she'd been on X for 15 years sharing comedic takes on pop culture and reality TV, but \"to see it turn into the hell scape that it is today has been devastating.\" Even the author and very active X user Stephen King joined Threads, telling his 7 million X followers that he was leaving the platform. \"Tried to stay, but the atmosphere has just become too toxic.\"\nThe large number of people swearing off X for other services may spell the end to social media as we know it. Instead of just of a tiny number of extremely popular sites for posting news, opinions, and memes, as has been the case for more than a decade, a number of new options are gaining millions of users, such Threads, owned by Facebook parent Meta, and Bluesky.\nDaily users of X, previously known as Twitter, have declined consistently since Musk acquired it in 2022. Last year, it had roughly 250 million daily active users and Musk claimed that the total would grow to 1 billion in 2024. On election day last week, X had only 162 million daily users\u2014and even that was a yearly high, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm that tracks the platform. A day later, that number had already dropped by 5 million, to 157 million daily users.\nUnder Musk's ownership, X has lost an average of 14% of its users monthly, according to Sensor Tower. Despite the slight boost in daily users on the day of the election, an \u201celongated slide in active users\u201d has continued, Sensor Tower\u2019s research lead Seema Shah told Fortune.\nShortly after taking over X, Musk made major changes to the platform to advance what he described as \"free speech,\" whittling down the hundreds of people that once worked on content moderation for Twitter to just a handful of contract employees, reinstating openly white supremacist or otherwise vitriolic personalities, and boosting only accounts that paid to be verified, effectively gamifying the entire platform. He also tilted the algorithm to favor inflammatory posts and conservative flash points, gleefully joining the fray himself, often passing along political and racial conspiracy theories to his 200 million followers.\nStory Continues\nLate in the recent presidential campaign, Musk overtly joined forces with Trump by campaigning for him and donating heavily to ensure a Trump victory, using X as a tool to that end. He has since been by Trump\u2019s side in Florida and has been rewarded by the President-elect as the co-head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, which shares an acronym with a cryptocurrency Musk often promotes.\nFor many users, such a platform, whatever it may have once been, is no longer fun or useful. And it's set off the latest chorus of people proclaiming their exit from X\u2014for good this time, even if many have decided to keep their accounts live, but vow not to post anything more on them.\n\u201cThere has been a steady drift away from X for a while,\u201d Jonathan Bellack, senior director of Harvard University\u2019s Applied Social Media Lab that\u2019s part of the Berkman Klein Center, told Fortune. \u201cAnd yes, we\u2019re seeing more people doing it more loudly at the moment, but people have been leaving for months and months. Now, I wonder if people are choosing to leave because of their beliefs, or because the experience on the platform has gotten worse.\u201d\nThis X diaspora has coincided with the rising influence of other forms of media, like podcasts, long-form video, group chats, and comments sections on YouTube and Discord, for instance. It's also come amid the increasing adoption of newly-founded social media platforms. Today, many public personalities and journalists\u2014long the backbone of Twitter and X\u2014post the same thing across Threads, Bluesky, and X, hedging their bets on what may go viral where.\nFor years, Twitter enjoyed near immunity from new rivals because its network effect was so strong. The more people who used it, the more useful it became and the more others therefore wanted to join. That flywheel spun for a long time, keeping social media startups and even behemoths like Meta, from even attempting to directly compete. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg quipped a decade ago that Twitter was \"a clown car that drove into a goldmine.\" When Musk started to take the wheels off of Twitter, Zuckerberg put 15 engineers to work building a veritable clone now known as Threads.\nWhatever people\u2019s reasons for leaving X, the two most likely places for people to land is either Threads or Bluesky, a startup initiated by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Both platforms debuted last year and are currently jockeying for first and second place in Apple\u2019s App store for most-downloaded free apps in the U.S. TikTok and WhatsApp, also owned by Meta, are in the top 10 as well. Meanwhile, X is in 29th place, behind other social apps like Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta.\nNo third party research service tracks when users delete an app from their phone. But SimilarWeb found that at least 115,000 users deactivated their X accounts via the web the day after the recent election. That same day, Google Search interest in the phrase \"Delete X\" rose 150% and has continued to grow by double digit percentage points each day since, according to Huge, a design and technology company that conducts custom research. Even news outlet The Guardian said this week it was abandoning all 80 of his official accounts, with a collective 27 million followers, due to the increase in\u00a0\u201cdisturbing content promoted or found on the platform.\"\nAnother data point is anecdotal: Over the past week, many top X users say they\u2019ve lost significant numbers of followers, ranging from dozens to hundreds or even thousands. Brent Troderian, who has over 150,000 followers on X, said on Threads that he\u2019s lost about 1,000 followers since the election. Another well-known figure on X, Aaron Rupar, who writes a newsletter on politics and media, said he hemorrhaged 10,000 of his nearly 1 million followers last week. \u201cWhile I'm not above a bad tweet or two, I don't think it's anything I posted,\u201d he wrote.\nAlthough there has been speculation online that some of these declines could be related to bots or inauthentic accounts suddenly leaving or being deleted from the platform, there is no clear evidence to support the notion.\nIn any case, such follower losses coincide with growth in activity on rival platforms. New users of Threads in the last month grew 394% year over year, according to Sensor Tower. Meta said in October the service had reached 275 million monthly active users. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram who also oversees Threads, said Thursday that the platform had added another 15 million users so far in November, and was \"going on three months with more than a million sign ups a day.\"\nWhile Bluesky has far fewer users, it's been a trending topic on X and Threads over the last week as people discussed where there were heading while leaving X. Since the election, it has added almost 1 million new users, to a total of nearly 15 million.\nTikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat have all added users as well each month over the last year, from 3% to 10%, according to Sensor Tower.\nDespite all of the apparent momentum away from X, and the manipulation of its content algorithm in favor of right-wing politics and Musk himself, at least some of the people who may be leaving X are being replaced by new users. It\u2019s possible there is a sort of swap going on\u2014use among people fed up with the pro-Trump drift and Musk's omnipresence is, to some extent, being covered by people who are attracted to exactly that.\n\u201cAlthough X has experienced this elongated decline in overall US active users over the past few years, it has seen a sizable uptick in new users, or those who had previously never registered a session on X,\u201d Shah of Sensor Tower told Fortune.\nAccording to Sensor Tower, new mobile app users for X jumped 17% in October, among the few notable increases it\u2019s seen since Musk\u2019s takeover.\nWhile this isn\u2019t enough to offset X\u2019s sustained loss in users since Musk\u2019s acquisition, the overall migration among social media platforms is part and parcel to a new era of online fragmentation. This online splintering is taking with it some of the cultural and media power that had coalesced around what was Twitter, according to Bellack of Harvard, and it\u2019s likely that no one platform or type of media will take up that position ever again.\n\u201cTwitter always had a level of influence that was disproportionate to its number of users \u2013 it had a public square feeling, yes, but there\u2019s no reason that\u2019s the only way social media can work,\u201d Bellack said. \u201cPeople leaving X, the fragmentation and people sorting themselves in other places, it\u2019s just reinforcing the notion that there will no longer be one definitive platform, and that\u2019s probably a good thing.\u201d\nAre you a tech employee or someone with insight or a tip to share?

The step can be used by companies to give them some breathing space from creditors to try to pay back their debts.\nIt is understood Typhoo is using the process to explore rescue options, with administrators from EY lined up. The court notice does not mean that Typhoo is in administration.\nTyphoo, which was founded in 1903 by Birmingham grocer John Sumner, was once one of the UK\u2019s best-selling tea brands.\nHowever, sales have struggled in recent years. Revenues fell from \u00a334m in 2022 to \u00a325m last year, while losses ballooned to \u00a338m from \u00a39.7m a year earlier, according to publicly available accounts.\nThe steep jump in losses came after the company suffered a break-in at its mothballed factory in Merseyside, which involved \u201cextensive damage\u201d to machinery and tea stock.

His comments suggest pubs could keep the same number of staff but focus them on delivering food and drink to tables rather than handling orders at the bar.\nSuch a system may enable them to get through a higher volume of orders, helping to increase revenues while keeping costs stable.\nMr Dodd is the latest pub chief to raise the prospect of fewer bartenders as a result of the Budget.

Sound on for the track and also available on Spotify. Love you P \u2764\ufe0f\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so romantic,\u201d Chan said while giggling in an Instagram Stories video responding to the song. \u201c21 years later I can\u2019t get quite as low, but it brings back a lot of fond memories.\u201d\nZuckerberg, a.k.a. \u201cZ-Pain,\u201d and T-Pain took an acoustic, slower approach to the cover\u2014although most of the explicit lyrics remain.

This was also the same era in which Zuckerberg had launched \u201cFacemash,\u201d one of the early versions of Facebook, which ranked the attractiveness of Harvard students.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed higher on Thursday despite an overall decline in the stock market.\nConsumer group Which? has filed a \u00a33 billion ($3.81 billion) legal claim against Apple, accusing the tech giant of breaching UK competition law through its iCloud service.\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) reduced stake in Apple from 400 million to 300 million shares. Thus, Berkshire has now cut its position in the Cupertino, California-based tech giant by over two-thirds since 2023's third quarter.\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.44%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\nTrending: Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,369,320 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $273,864 or around 1,200 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nSee Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nStory Continues\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nYou Can Profit From Real Estate Without Being A Landlord\nReal estate is a great way to diversify your portfolio and earn high returns, but it can also be a big hassle. Luckily, there are other ways to tap into the power of real estate without owning property. Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other best metaverse stocks.\nWhat is the Metaverse?\nAccording to McKinsey & Company, the metaverse is the emerging 3-D-enabled digital space that uses virtual reality, augmented reality, and other advanced internet and semiconductor technology to allow people to have lifelike experiences online.\nThe basic features of the metaverse include a sense of immersion, real-time interactivity, and user agency. Whereas, the full vision of the metaverse encompasses platforms and devices that work seamlessly with each other, the possibility for thousands of people to interact simultaneously, and use cases well beyond gaming. While the phenomenon gained attention in 2021 with internet searches for the term increasing by 7,200%, it seems here to stay. With lockdowns and work-from-home policies in place, the interest in shared virtual environments spiked. The opportunity remains vast with metaverse having the potential to generate up to $5 trillion in value by 2030.\nIs the Metaverse Still Alive?\nWhen the tech guru Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook\u2019s name to Meta in 2021, he clearly drove the metaverse narrative in the world. Although the vision of a digital future of work and recreation became a buzz for a while, other emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence decided to dominate the headlines later.\nQuestions regarding whether Zuckerberg should have transformed a successful social media company into a VR venture have also been asked. In September 2023, BBC reported that his company\u2019s virtual and augmented reality branch, Reality Labs, has lost $21 billion since the prior year. The firm later introduced its social virtual reality space Horizon Worlds. While some users have complained about not having enough people to make it fun, the platform\u2019s monthly users can simply not match the number of people who consume social media like Facebook and Instagram every day.\nAlthough the company\u2019s virtual reality headset and its Horizon Worlds have not gone mainstream after 3 years of the company\u2019s founding, experts argue that the metaverse is still as relevant as ever. On October 2, CNBC reported that Zuckerberg\u2019s metaverse is finally showing signs of life as his company might have found its footing in VR and AR through a different medium, smart glasses. After the firm witnessed early success in the market for smart glasses via a partnership with Ray-Ban, the CEO unveiled the first \u201cfully-functioning\u201d prototype AR glasses, Orion, in September.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe right way to look at Orion is as a time machine. These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\u201d\nAlthough there might be a lack of connection between the metaverse which was the next big thing two years ago and the prevailing tech landscape dominated by AI, some argue that the reports of the metaverse\u2019s death are \u2018exaggerated\u2019 and that it is a rather long-term concept to materialize as a digital future for masses.\nOur Methodology\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders:\u00a0184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is well known for its smartphones, also makes the hardware that blends the digital and the virtual world. While the Mac introduced Apple to personal computing, and the iPhone introduced it to mobile computing, the firm stepped into the metaverse as it debuted its virtual reality headset.\nThe iPhone maker launched its Vision Pro headset at its annual WWDC event in June 2023. As a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, the firm claimed the device as to be years ahead and unlike anything created before. It builds upon Apple\u2019s innovation and experience designing high-performance products such as the Mac, iPhone, and wearables like the Apple Watch.\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended September 28, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported revenue of $94.9 billion, a record September quarter revenue driven by iPhone. Additionally, Apple\u2019s active installed base of devices hit a new all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. During the quarter, the firm was excited to announce the new iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4.\nThus, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to benefit from its leading innovation, expertise, and a potential surge in demand for AR/VR devices with the growth in the metaverse. The stock is held by 184 hedge funds, as of Q2.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

In August, an RFE/RL reporter was released in a prisoner swap after being convicted in Russia for spreading \"fake news\" about the Russian military.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The recent rise in its shares pushed Nvidia to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.6tn (\u00a32.8tn).\nShares rose earlier this week after Nvidia said that Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) would be the first to receive its AI Blackwell chips.\nThis came as part of a series of collaborations with SoftBank that Nvidia announced on Tuesday.\nRead more: How Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote speech at the chipmaker's AI Summit in Japan, that SoftBank would be using its Blackwell platform to build Japan's most powerful AI supercomputer.\nIn addition, Nvidia also revealed that SoftBank, using the chipmaker's AI Aerial computing platform, had piloted the world's first combined AI and 5G telecom network.\nThe attention now turns to Nvidia's third-quarter results for its 2025 fiscal year, with the chipmaker having guided to revenue of $32.5bn, plus or minus 2%, for the period in its previous quarterly report.\nStory continues\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Markets forecasts expect that number to be a little higher. If NVIDIA continues its strong run of beating market expectations, things could be better still.\"\n\"There\u2019s likely to be more emphasis however on the outlook for the final three months of the year, where consensus is currently looking for revenue of $36.6bn.\"\nIn the second quarter, revenue came in at $30bn, which was 122% higher than the previous year. Nvidia posted earnings per diluted share of $0.67, which was up 168% on the previous year.\n\"Any steer as to how well the recently launched ultra-fast Blackwell chip is selling will also be closely scrutinised,\" Nathan said.\n\"There\u2019s no shortage of demand as the likes of Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) look to gain an edge in the AI race. But there remain some unanswered questions about Nvidia\u2019s supply chain\u2019s ability to keep pace.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nWalmart (WMT) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Tuesday 19 November\nWall Street will keeping an eye on retailer Walmart's latest results to see if it reports another solid quarter, as consumer price pressures persist.\nLatest data showed consumer prices grew by 2.6% in October, which was a slight uptick for the 2.4% rate of inflation recorded in September.\nThe figure was still above the US Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target but was in line with with expectations, sustaining investor hopes that the central bank will potentially cut interest rates again in December.\nHowever, there are concerns that potential policies around trade tariffs from president-elect Donald Trump, after he returns to the White House in January, could drive inflation higher.\nAs the world's largest retailer by sales, Walmart's results can provide an insight into US consumer sentiment.\nRead more: UK growth slows between July and September as services sector falters\nIn the second quarter, Walmart (WMT) logged revenue growth of 4.8% of $169.34bn, beating estimates of $168.46bn.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.67 also beat expectations of $0.65 and marked a 9.8% increase year-on-year.\nThis strong performance contributed to a 61% rise in Walmart shares year-to-date.\nCEO Doug McMillon said: \"Each part of our business is growing \u2013 store and club sales are up, e-commerce is compounding as we layer on pickup and even faster growth in delivery as our speed improves.\"\nFor the third quarter, Walmart guided to an increase of 3.25% to 4.25% in consolidated net sales, compared with the same period last year when it delivered $159.4bn in net sales.\nWalmart said it was expecting consolidated operating income to rise between 3% and 4.5% in the third quarter, up from $6.2bn last year.\nThe company expected adjusted earnings per share to come in at $0.51 to $0.52, compared with $0.51 for the third quarter last year.\n\u2022 USD\n(WMT)\nFollow\nView quote details\nImperial Brands (IMB.L) \u2014 Reports full-year results on Tuesday 19 November\nShares in tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMB.L) are currently trading at a five-year high, with the stock up 31% year-to-date.\nThat's despite the higher duties on cigarettes and vapes announced in the recent UK autumn budget.\n\"These moves add to a long list of regulatory and tax measures designed to deter consumers from smoking, after interventions on advertising and packaging design,\" said AJ Bell's Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth.\nEven so, the investment experts said that Imperial Brands continues to see strong profits and cash generation, much of which could be attributed to the five-year plan set out by CEO Stefan Bomhard, who took the reins in 2020.\nIn its full year results last year, Imperial Brands posted a 7.1% decline in tobacco volumes (excluding Russia), but the company raised its prices by an average of 11%. Sales in its next generation product segment rose 26%.\nRead more: Rachel Reeves hints at looser regulation in bid to improve UK's competitiveness\n\"Imperial will be looking to a similar recipe in the year to September 2024, for which chief executive Stefan Bomhard gave clear guidance alongside the full-year results for 2023 back in November,\" said Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth.\nIn its half-year results, Imperial Brands said it expected to deliver revenue growth in the low-single digits on a constant currency basis for its tobacco and next generation products segments.\nThe company forecast that adjusted operating profit would grow by close to the middle of its mid-single digit range.\nOn the back of this guidance, AJ Bell's investment experts said that analysts were expecting group adjusted operating profit of \u00a33.9bn, which would be flat on the previous year.\nAnalysts were also said to be expecting adjusted earnings per share of \u00a32.95, up from \u00a32.79 last year.\nIn terms of its dividend, Imperial Brands has produced three consecutive increases in the payout, with analysts said to be looking for another advance to \u00a31.53 per share in this set of results. The company also recently announced a further share buyback of \u00a31.25bn, which it is set to complete by the end of October 2025.\n\u2022 USD\n(IMB.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nJD Sports (JD.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter trading update on Thursday 21 November\nSportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) had a tougher start to its fiscal year but Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the situation has since picked up for the business. However, shares in the company are still down nearly 29% year-to-date.\nIn its interim results, JD Sports logged 5% growth in revenue to \u00a35.03bn, while profit before tax and adjusting items was up 2% to \u00a3405.6m.\n\"It was pleasing to see Europe, North America and Asia Pacific markets all posting double-digit sales growth,\" said Chiekrie. \"But the UK market remains challenging and volatile, and full-year profit guidance got a small downgrade as a result.\"\nHe said that JD Sports was trying to offset these challenges by \"tightening its belt and streamlining operations\".\nRead more: December UK interest rate cut unlikely despite GDP slowdown\n\"Investors will be hoping that means there won\u2019t be further downgrades to the full-year outlook in next week's results,\" he said.\nChiekrie said that investors would also be wanting to see how its takeover of US sporting goods supplier Hibbett is progressing, having completed the acquisition in July.\n\"The deal has substantially increased the group\u2019s footprint in the US, but there\u2019s a lot of work to do to make sure a deal of this size pulls in the expected benefits,\" he said.\nIn terms of its UK business, Andy Higginson, who is both chair of JD Sports and the British Retail Consortium, recently warned that tax rises on businesses announced in the autumn budget would result in prices to rise for shoppers.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the budget that employers would have to pay 15% in national insurance on salaries over \u00a35,000, rising from the current rate of 13.8% on salaries over \u00a39,100.\n\"I'm guaranteeing you today, if these go through as they are without any sort of feathering, we\u2019re going to see significant inflation in prices,\" Higginson said on the BBC's Today programme.\n\u2022 USD\n(JD.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nInternational Distribution Services (IDS.L) \u2014 Reports interim results on Thursday 21 November\nThe focus for investors in Royal Mail-owner International Distribution Services will be on the takeover of the company led by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.\nIDS agreed to the \u00a33.57bn takeover offer back in May, with the offer made through a special purpose vehicle, EP UK Bidco Limited, owned by J&T Capital Partners and EP Corporate Group. Kretinsky is the majority owner of EP Corporate Group.\nKeith Williams, the chair of IDS, said that the company's board had negotiated a \"far reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments which provide our customers, employees and broader stakeholders with important safeguards.\"\nRead more: What does the launch of pension megafunds mean for investors?\nMeanwhile, Kretinsky said: \"The EP Group has the utmost respect for Royal Mail's history and tradition, and I know that owning this business will come with enormous responsibility \u2013 not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day.\"\nIn terms of its company performance, IDS said that total parcels volumes were up 11% in its first quarter. Meanwhile, revenue across the IDS group had risen 8% to \u00a33.2bn.\nIn September, regulator Ofcom said it was considering changes to the UK postal service for Royal Mail. This included the potential scrapping of second class letter deliveries on Saturdays.\nHowever, a decision had not yet been made, with Ofcom saying it expected to consult on proposals for reform in early 2025, with a view to announcing a decision in summer 2025.\nIDS reportedly said that the \u201cchange cannot come soon enough\u201d to the UK postal service.\n\u2022 USD\n(IDS.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nOther companies reporting next week include:\nMonday 18 November\nBig Yellow (BYG.L)\nSirius Real Estate (SRE.L)\nTuesday 19 November\nDiploma (DPLM.L)\nAvon Protection (AVNBF)\nCML Microsystems (CML.L)\nRevolution Beauty (REVB.L)\nGB Group (GBG.L)\nGear4Music (G4M.L)\nXiaomi (1810.HK)\nSonova (SONVY)\nThyssenKrupp (TKA.DE)\nLowe\u2019s (LOW)\nMedtronic (MDT)\nDollar Tree (DLTR)\nAmer Sports (AS)\nDolby Laboratories (DLB)\nWednesday 20 November\nSage (SGE.L)\nMitchells & Butlers (MAB.L)\nTracsis (TRCS.L)\nRotork (ROR.L)\nSoftcat (SCT.L)\nBaloise (BALN.SW)\nSoitec (SLOIF)\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW)\nTarget (TGT)\nSnowflake (SNOW)\nNio (NIO)\nThursday 21 November\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\nGrainger (GRI.L)\nJet2 (JET2.L)\nMitie (MTO.L)\nSpeedy Hire (SDY.L)\nNorcros (NXR.L)\nWarehouse REIT (WHR.L)\nCrest Nicholson (CRST.L)\nBreedon (BREE.L)\nBaidu (BIDU)\nIntuit (INTU)\nPDD (PDD)\nWarner Music (WMG)\nGap (GAP)\nFriday 22 November\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\nMeituan (3690.HK)\nCathay Pacific Airways (CPCAF)\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\nRead more on stocks:\nTrending tickers: Tesla, Alibaba, Pfizer, Domino's and Disney\nFTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win\nHow Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

Nearly $99 billion is pegged on two iconic names: Apple and Coca-Cola. Through Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has channeled a whopping half of his equity holdings into Apple alone and he's held tight to his Coca-Cola shares since the late 1980s.\nDon't Miss:\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $1,000\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date.\nHis strategy here is simple but powerful \u2013 backing companies with brand strength and consistent financials. Apple's stock, for instance, surged 31% this year and many see this as Buffett's savviest move yet. Some say it's his \"crown jewel,\" lauding his foresight in spotting a tech company that's proven as resilient as it is profitable.\nBut as with any big bet, Buffett's heavy reliance on Apple has sparked some chatter. Skeptics say putting so many eggs in one tech basket could be risky. With tech stocks, there's always the threat of shifting consumer trends, not to mention the occasional market shake-up.\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nAnd while Apple has shown impressive gains this year, the latest numbers hint at a slight cooling. In the last fiscal year, Apple's total revenue dipped by 0.8% \u2013 a small shift but enough to raise eyebrows. Still, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring believes Apple has room to climb, setting a price target of $273, which would mark a 20% rise from current levels.\nApple's pivot toward services is holding it steady. Though iPhone sales may ebb and flow, Apple's revenues from the App Store, streaming and cloud services have grown by 23% over the past few years.\nServices have also helped Apple boost its profit margins, going from 43.3% in 2022 to 46.2% in 2024, catching Wall Street's attention. These margins and the cash flow from services make Apple's high share prices easier to swallow, especially as it could mean bigger dividends for shareholders.\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\nStory Continues\nThen there's Coca-Cola, which stands out as Buffett's textbook choice. It's familiar, steady and beloved worldwide. His initial investment in Coca-Cola in the late \u201880s has since grown to a $27.67 billion stake and despite recent bumps \u2013 like a 12% drop from September's peak \u2013 investors still see value here.\nMorgan Stanley's Dara Mohsenian predicts Coca-Cola could climb to $76 a share, marking a potential 19% increase.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nNYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nIn Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThere\u2019s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump\u2019s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.\nBut there\u2019s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate \u2014 especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect \u2014 and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.\nThese cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk\u2019s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up less than 1%, while Facebook parent Meta is down 0.6%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 3.5%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 2%.\nAs the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they\u2019re thinking about. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying:\nTiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:\n\u201cTariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.\nWe have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.\u201d\nMark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we\u2019ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.\nI don\u2019t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.\u201d\nMark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.\n\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she\u2019s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.\u201d\nThreats against Alphabet and Meta are \u201cjust talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn\u2019t take kindly to that. However, I don\u2019t think anything like this will make it into policy.\u201d\nKevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management\n\u201cTrump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn\u2019t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn\u2019t put him the best light.\nThe thing that\u2019s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That\u2019s a counter perspective to that. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren\u2019t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.\nI don\u2019t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined. I have exposure to Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple. I don\u2019t know how tariffs will impact Nvidia, since the demand will remain there no matter what. Broadcom goes kind of hand in hand with that. I think that at Apple, Cook will take steps to keep the products from exploding in price.\u201d\nAdam Grossman, chief investment officer of global equity at Riverfront Investment Group:\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unclear a week after the election. I do think he could get tariffs through on China, but getting tariffs through on Europe, that\u2019s another ball of wax.\nFor someone like Donald Trump, I think he\u2019s going to have enough other issues that they\u2019re going to kind of fly off of his radar.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nChinese tech conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering an offering of bonds totaling the equivalent of about $5 billion as soon as this month, people familiar with the matter said.\nElon Musk\u2019s social media platform X sued to block a California law aimed at curbing AI-generated deceptive election content on social media, claiming the measure is an unconstitutional affront to free speech.\nMeta Platforms Inc. said it intends to appeal court rulings allowing dozens of states and hundreds of school districts across the US to proceed with lawsuits blaming \u201caddictive\u201d social media apps for contributing to a mental health crisis among youths.\nSamsung Electronics Co. plans to buy back about 10 trillion won ($7.2 billion) of its own stock over the next year, putting in motion one of the larger shareholder return programs in its history.\nLenovo Group Ltd. hiked its projection for global PC shipments in 2025 after posting better-than-expected earnings, saying AI features will help boost growth next year.\nEarnings Due Friday\nPremarket\nAlibaba\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nCEOs Brace for the Chaos of Another Four Years of Trump\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nBetting on Tesla Helped Ron Baron Beat the Index.

The market is huge \u2014 a potential $150 billion a year by the end of the decade \u2014 and any financial miss, or negative data of any kind, will trigger outsized sell-offs.\nThis past week, for example, Amgen (AMGN) lost $12 billion in market value. Hims & Hers (HIMS) lost 10% in a single day in October when the FDA ended the shortage designation of Eli Lilly's (LLY) drugs. (Its worst day on record was Nov. 14, down 24% after Amazon (AMZN) launched a direct prescription service modeled after the company.)\nLast month was the most dramatic, when Lilly saw more than $127 billion in stock value wiped out at peak loss in a single day. The company missed analyst estimates on its diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (Investors bought the Lilly dip and the loss was pared to $54 billion by market close).\nThe recovery in the stock came only after CEO David Ricks responded to an analyst question on an earnings call about the sales miss, saying that demand was up 25% quarter over quarter. The stock started to pick up right after that, according to Citi healthcare analyst Geoff Meacham.\nHow volatile is that? The move seen in Lilly's stock is typically reserved for Magnificent Seven stocks. For example, the day after the election, Tesla's (TSLA) market cap increased by $120 billion.\nThe day of Lilly's loss, another company on its way into the GLP-1 space was grappling with what the sell-off could mean for its future.\nAmgen CFO Peter Griffith told Yahoo Finance the company, whose GLP-1 candidate MariTide is still only in mid-stage clinical trials, was worried investors were going to change how they rewarded the company's stock \u2014 from weighing overall performance to focusing on a single product.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that MariTide \u2026 will eclipse the rest of our news here in the near future,\u201d Griffith said, unaware at the time he would face that exact fate two weeks later.\nThe company's stock was hammered Nov. 12 after older MariTide data published by an analyst briefly appeared to highlight a problematic side effect, which was quickly waved off by other analysts and Amgen itself.\n\u2022 USD\n(LLY)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMore volatility?\nThe potential for high returns has created an energy around the leading GLP-1 companies \u2014 and serves as a cautionary tale for those that will follow.\n\u201cThere are more eyeballs on Novo and Lilly than any other stock in healthcare, by a mile. That alone is going to read more volatility,\u201d said Mizuho's healthcare sector expert Jared Holz.\nStory Continues\nSome investors are looking for consistently large returns quarter over quarter and only care about the GLP-1 drugs.\n\u201cNo one even asks a question outside of obesity on the Lilly or Novo [earnings] conference calls. And they both have a bunch of other things going on,\u201d Holz told Yahoo Finance.\nLilly is one of two market leaders in the space, along with Novo Nordisk (NVO), and could be the first $1 trillion healthcare company by market cap.\nIt's why, despite having a diverse portfolio of products \u2014 including one of only two new Alzheimer's drugs on the market \u2014 the weight-loss drug Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro are weighing more heavily on the stock. And misses of those two products are triggering Wall Street action.\nSemaglutide weight-loss drug Wegovy, made by pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. (James Manning/PA Images via Getty Images) \u00b7 James Manning - PA Images via Getty Images\nGoldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani believes that while Lilly may not ever reach $1 trillion, it has outperformed for two, and potentially three, years in a row despite the volatility.\n\u201cThat\u2019s also a pretty exclusive club, where a stock manages, for three years in a row, to outperform its peers,\u201d Shibutani said.\nCiti\u2019s Meacham pointed out that some investors may only be holding Lilly and no other healthcare stocks. \u201cThe reason I think you saw such a huge move is that there are a lot of investors that \u2026 may only own one healthcare stock, and that\u2019s Lilly,\u201d Meacham said.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 Shibutani similarly noted more general investors have a \u201cFOMO\u201d (fear of missing out) mindset impacting the stock.\nHe noted that there are two categories that have invoked that feeling for the past few years: artificial intelligence and obesity.\nIt\u2019s \u201ca bit of zeitgeist, sort of a cultural phenomenon,\u201d Shibutani said.\nHolz also noted that there could be more volatility ahead for GLP-1s.\n\u201cThese things kind of tend to trade with a zero-sum game \u2014 rightly or wrongly,\u201d he said.\nYahoo Finance editor Jared Blikre contributed to this report.

          "whole_article": "Listen and subscribe to Yahoo Finance Sports Report on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\nJoey Logano lifted the trophy in Phoenix this past weekend, winning his third NASCAR Championship in the last six years after beating his teammate Ryan Blaney by just 0.330 seconds.\nAnd while many fans plead with NASCAR to change the playoff format that allowed a driver with just one win in the regular season to take home a championship, America\u2019s most popular and profitable racing series has its sights set on the future.\nNASCAR signed a historic media rights extension last year worth $7.7 billion over seven years. The deal provides inventory to four broadcasters \u2014 Fox (FOX), NBC (CMCSA), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 who will split 38 races across their channels each year starting with the 2025 season.\n\u201dWhen we were having discussions about the deal itself, we made a big deal about promotion, and [Amazon] told us that they were going to treat us at the level of the NFL,\u201d NASCAR president Steve Phelps said on Yahoo Finance Sports Report. \u201cAnd that\u2019s saying something. I think they\u2019ve had tremendous success, and the growth that they\u2019ve had with Thursday Night Football has been extraordinary.\u201d\nThe deal kicks in after a somewhat tumultuous year for the sport.\nThe 2024 NASCAR season was a slog, both on and off the track. Rain at the season-opening Daytona 500 pushed NASCAR\u2019s most popular race from Sunday to Monday, resulting in a 27% drop in viewership right out of the gate. Things got worse when a handful of NASCAR\u2019s other most popular races \u2014 Coca-Cola 600, Clash at the Coliseum, Chicago Street Race \u2014 saw double-digit viewership declines due to rain.\nAdd in a lawsuit from the sport\u2019s most popular owner, Michael Jordan of 23XI Racing, and it would be fair to assume that NASCAR\u2019s leadership lost some sleep this year.\nBut while there undoubtedly were some challenging moments, NASCAR fought back throughout its 36-race schedule to quietly put up a very good season.\nNASCAR races averaged 2.892 million viewers this year. That\u2019s a respectable 1% increase year over year, considering how things started in Daytona, and it means NASCAR is still roughly 2.5 times bigger than Formula 1 in the United States.\nNASCAR also continued to attract blue-chip sponsors, bringing in $362 million in sponsorship revenue this year through deals with a host of publicly traded companies, including Goodyear (GT), Xfinity (CMCSA), Chevrolet (GM), Toyota (TM), Coca-Cola (KO), Ford (F), and GEICO.\nNASCAR has only four sponsorship deals with companies based outside the US right now, but the company will look to change that as it hosts the first-ever Cup Series race in Mexico City next year.\nStory Continues\nAnd NASCAR\u2019s new TV deal will likely help \u2014 as long as more viewers can follow along.\nJoey Logano, driver of the #22 Shell Pennzoil Ford, celebrates in victory lane after winning the NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race at Phoenix Raceway on Nov. 10, 2024, in Avondale, Ariz. (James Gilbert/Getty Images) \u00b7 James Gilbert via Getty Images\nThere are some concerns that fans may struggle with discoverability, as NASCAR races will now be broadcast across five different platforms \u2014 including a mix of broadcast, cable, and streaming. Nevertheless, NASCAR felt comfortable with the deal because it secured the company a near-35% increase in media rights, and it also convinced the new media companies to cross-promote races that appear on other channels.\n\u201cWe believe that our fanbase will migrate to Amazon Prime,\u201d NASCAR\u2019s Phelps said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got well into the 70s the percentage of NASCAR fans who have Amazon Prime. So that, to me, bodes well, and I think we\u2019re going to prove that streaming will be an important element for NASCAR racing well into the future.\u201d\nThe $7.7 billion media rights deal is part of NASCAR\u2019s overall push to modernize the sport. NASCAR recently renewed its Netflix series, \"NASCAR: Full Speed,\" for a second season after data revealed it was bringing in a younger, more female audience, and the sport\u2019s leadership team invested $53 million to open a new production facility.\nThese investments have already paid dividends for NASCAR, both domestically and internationally. The sport held races in 12 countries on three different continents in 2024. NASCAR is now broadcast in 185 countries and territories worldwide, reaching over 500 million households, and a mix of more innovative formats (Chicago Street Race) and host cities (Mexico City) should continue to push the sport to new heights.\nYahoo Finance Sports Report with Joe Pompliano looks beyond the latest sports business headlines, breaking down the teams, trades, and billion-dollar deals.

          "whole_article": "Amazon drones are already in use in Texas and Arizona - Amazon\nAmazon has been forced to delay plans to deliver parcels by drone to British households after foot-dragging on airspace regulation prevented it from launching the service.\nThe retail giant had been planning to start UK drone flights to deliver packages in under an hour by the end of this year, but admitted on Friday that it had not secured clearance to fly the autonomous aircraft.\nThe company said that while it was prepared to start operations, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had not yet set out rules allowing it to carry out deliveries.\nAn Amazon spokesman said: \u201cWe are ready to make drone delivery a reality for our customers in the UK.\n\u201cWe have built safe and reliable drone delivery services elsewhere in the world in close partnership with regulators and the communities we serve, and we are working to do the same in the UK.\n\u201cHowever, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is still developing the regulatory framework to support the type of operation that we launched in the United States. We will continue to work closely with the CAA as they develop the framework which can make commercial drone delivery a reality in the UK.\u201d\nAmazon declined to commit to a new timeline for flights, saying: \u201cWe have nothing more to share at this time, but will let our communities and customers know as our drone delivery service expands.\u201d\nDecade-long wait\nIt comes a decade after the US giant carried out its first drone tests in Cambridgeshire, raising the prospect that the UK would be the first market for drone deliveries.\nHowever, the company later moved testing to the US. It started commercial deliveries two years ago in California and Texas.\nAmazon has also recently started deliveries in Arizona, although it has also suspended flights in California.\nThe company said last year that it planned drone deliveries in Britain and Italy by the end of 2024.\nThe CAA said this summer that Amazon was one of six projects selected for trials of \u201cbeyond visual line of sight\u201d autonomous flights.\nDrone flights in Britain currently require companies to go through a lengthy airspace change process that partially blocks off the area to other operators. Flights have been slower to take off in the UK than in the US and Europe, where regulations have been updated to allow drones.\nAmazon is believed to have scouted potential locations but is yet to apply for airspace changes. It no longer occupies the site outside Cambridge where it carried out tests from 2015 before shutting down the project several years later.\nThis week, the NHS deployed autonomous drone flights to carry blood samples between London hospitals using aircraft developed by Wing, a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet.\nStory continues\nA CAA spokesman said: \u201cDrones have the potential to transform our lives but to make that possible we need to lay strong foundations for the future.\n\u201cOur priority is to protect the public while enabling this exciting new technology.\u201d\nThe regulator said in September that it was updating rules with a view to \u201clarge scale\u201d deployments by 2027."

Research from the company indicates that the power required for data centers to run incremental AI-optimized servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year in 2027, which is 2.6 times the level in 2023.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nBob Johnson, VP Analyst at Gartner, has said that the explosive growth of new hyperscale data centers to implement GenAI is creating an insatiable demand for power that will exceed the ability of utility providers to expand their capacity fast enough. In turn, per Johnson, this threatens to disrupt energy availability and lead to shortages, which will limit the growth of new data centers for GenAI and other uses from 2026. He added that short-term power shortages are likely to continue for years as new power transmission, distribution and generation capacity could take years to come online and won\u2019t alleviate current problems.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Walmart WMT shares have been standout performers this year, handily outperforming not just the broader market indexes and peers like Target TGT but also the likes of Amazon AMZN and most of the Magnificent 7 group members.\nWith the company on deck to report quarterly results on Tuesday, November 19th, it will be interesting if the stock can maintain its performance momentum after the results. Walmart shares were up big following the beat-and-raise quarterly results on August 15th, with the positive trend firmly in place since.\nThe chart below spotlights Walmart\u2019s impressive performance. The chart tracks the year-to-date performance of Walmart shares (up +60.6%) relative to the S&P 500 index (+25.1%), Amazon (+33.8%) and Target (+7.8%).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn addition to Walmart, this week also brings quarterly results from Target on Wednesday, November 20th, and Lowe\u2019s LOW on Tuesday, November 19th.\nAs with Home Depot, which has already reported better-than-expected quarterly results, Lowe\u2019s is primarily a housing play, which has been struggling for some time now due to higher mortgage rates that have proven sticky despite the start of the Fed\u2019s easing cycle.\nDemand for big home remodeling projects and other big-ticket items has remained depressed as existing home sales remain at a 20-year low. Home prices have risen nicely, but a majority of existing homeowners are financed at record-low mortgage rates, making them unwilling to replace that mortgage with a much higher level.\nHome Depot\u2019s results benefited from the impact of the recent hurricanes in the Southeast, and we can reasonably expect a comparable gain from Lowe\u2019s. Management noted that demand for discretionary big-ticket items and remodeling projects remained anemic due to the factors mentioned above.\nAnother consumer spending that has been at play in the post-COVID period is consumers prioritizing discretionary services like travel, leisure, dining out, and hospitality. As a result of this trend, demand for discretionary goods and products, including big-ticket items like appliances, furniture, etc., has suffered.\nThe very notable underperformance of Target shares in the first chart we shared is a direct result of this weak demand for discretionary merchandise, a product category to which Target is heavily exposed.\nUnlike Target, Walmart has a much heavier indexing to groceries and other \u2018staply\u2019 must-have product categories that enjoy relatively more stable demand through economic cycles. Walmart\u2019s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\nStory Continues\nWalmart\u2019s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has substantial exposure to lower-income consumers who are under a lot of financial stress due to the cumulative effects of inflation. Walmart has thus far been able to offset weakness from lower-income consumers by attracting more higher-income households through its efficient digital offerings.\nWalmart is expected to report $0.53 in EPS on $167.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +3.9% and +4.2%, respectively. Trends in Walmart\u2019s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, though management had pointed to some early signs of stabilization in a few discretionary product categories at the last earnings call. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target.\nWith respect to the\nRetail sector 2024 Q3 earnings season scorecard\n, we now have results from 24 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon (AMZN) and restaurant players. The 24 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q3 results already belong primarily to the e-commerce and restaurant industries, though Home Depot is also included in that count.\nTotal Q3 earnings for these 24 retailers that have reported are up +14.9% from the same period last year on +6.3% higher revenues, with 54.2% beating EPS estimates and only 50% beating revenue estimates.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators have struggled with beating estimates in Q3, with the trend particularly notable on the EPS beats front that is tracking below the 20-quarter low at this stage.\nWith respect to the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 24 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +71.6% on +11% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS and top- line expectations.\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart\u2019s coming results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player, thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon\u2019s results (left side chart) and without Amazon\u2019s numbers (right side chart).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nThrough Friday, November 15th, we have seen Q3 results from 461 S&P 500 members, or 92.2% of the index\u2019s total membership. We have another 14 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week, including Nvidia, Deere & Company, and others in addition to the aforementioned retailers.\nTotal earnings for these 461 companies that have reported are up +6.8% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues, with 73.8% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.4% beating revenue estimates.\nThe proportion of these 461 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 50.8%.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. The first set of comparison charts shows the earnings and revenue growth rates.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe second set of comparison charts compares the Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below spotlight the revenue performance and the blended beats percentage for this group of 461 index members.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that Q3 earnings growth has been held down by the weak growth rate in the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be +9.3% (vs. +6.8% as a whole).\nThe chart below compares the ex-Energy growth earnings and revenue growth rates in Q3 relative to other recent periods.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the growth trend appears stable-to-positive, though fewer companies have beat consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter averages.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues.\nThe chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.\nHad it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +10.1% instead of +7.7%. Excluding the Tech sector\u2019s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be up only +2.9% instead of +7.7%.\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +2.3% instead of +7.4%.\nFor the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues.\nUnlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better, as the chart below shows.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with the +7.9% earnings growth this year followed by double-digit gains in 2025 and 2026.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +7.9% earnings growth improves to +9.8% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Looking Ahead to Retail Sector Q3 Earnings\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Is it possible that a former YouTuber can take down the baddest man on the planet?\nJake Paul (10-1), whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes YouTube celebrity, marketer and prizefighter, will face former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson (50-6) in a sanctioned eight-round bout. It\u2019s a marketing event for the ages, as Paul is the young up-and-comer, who started fighting professionally in January 2020, building his record against former UFC fighters and fellow YouTubers.\nTyson\u2019s legacy is set, but he\u2019s also 58 years old, so a win is far from certain. Paul also has a longer reach and stands three inches taller than Tyson.\nThe fight will be a bit different than a typical heavyweight bout. Rounds will last just two minutes instead of the traditional three. And both fighters will wear 14-ounce gloves instead of the traditional 10-ounce ones.\nIt\u2019s expected to be the biggest live event in live streaming history for host network Netflix. Here\u2019s all you need to know about how to catch the action.\nWhen are Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fighting?\nPaul and Tyson will square off on Friday, Nov. 15.\nWhat time does the Tyson vs. Paul fight begin?\nThe card gets underway at 8:00 p.m. ET. There\u2019s an undercard with six additional fights, however (only three of which will air on Netflix), so there\u2019s no telling exactly when Paul and Tyson will take to the ring.\nWhy is this fight happening?\nPublicity and cash. Paul is an expert at snagging the media\u2019s attention, so challenging someone who has a reputation like Tyson is an easy way to steal the spotlight. Celebrity boxing has also become more popular in the past 20 years or so, guaranteeing an audience. Plus, there\u2019s a $40 million purse up for grabs\u2014and that\u2019s appealing to both boxers. \u201cI\u2019m here to make $40m and knock out a legend,\u201d Paul said at a news conference in August.\nFor Tyson, it\u2019s a chance to cement his legacy at an age where most boxers are long past their prime.\nCan I watch Tyson vs. Paul fight for free?\nNot unless you have a friend who subscribes to Netflix and they invite you over. The fight will not be broadcast on traditional TV or other streaming services.\nCan I stream the Paul vs. Tyson fight live online if I don't have a cable subscription?\nYes, but you only have one option.\nNetflix\nThe streaming king is the exclusive home of Paul vs. Tyson. There\u2019s no free trial, but you can cancel at any time. Plans start at $6.99 per month for the ad-supported option and $15.49 for ad-free.\nWhen is the last time Mike Tyson fought?\nTyson hasn\u2019t fought in an official bout since 2005, when he was downed in the sixth round by a TKO from Kevin McBride. He hasn\u2019t been in the ring since Nov. 28, 2020, when he met Roy Jones Jr. in an eight-round exhibition. That fight was declared a draw.\nStory Continues\nWasn\u2019t the Paul vs. Tyson fight supposed to happen months ago?\nIt was! Paul and Tyson were originally set to meet on July 20, but Tyson had to cancel after he became ill. His team later cited an \u201culcer problem\u201d that landed him in the hospital.\nWhat is the undercard for Paul vs. Tyson?\nKatie Taylor (23-1) vs. Amanda Serrano (47-2-1); WBC, WBA, WBO, IBF junior welterweight titles\nMario Barrios (29-2) vs. Abel Ramos (28-6-2); WBC welterweight title\nNeeraj Goyat (18-4-2) vs. Whindersson Nunes (debut)\nPreliminary fights (will stream on Most Valuable Promotions and Netflix Sports' YouTube channels)\nShadasia Green (14-1) vs. Melinda Watpool (7-0); WBO super middleweight title\nLucas Bahdi (17-0) vs. Armando Casamonica (14-0)\nBruce Carrington (13-0) vs. Dana Coolwell (13-2)\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Discovery's (WBD, Financials) HBO, the fight will be offered to Netflix's 280 million members at no extra cost.\nBased on Netflix's worldwide reach and seamless accessibility, analysts at J.P. Morgan (JPM, Financials) believe the event might become the most-watched boxing fight in history. The company expects the game to favorably affect Netflix's Q4 financial results by increasing overall viewers, additional ad-tier members, and advertising income.\nThe fight marks a larger drive by Netflix to include live programming into its platform; a move experts believe to be part of its approach to finding sustainable earning sources outside its current content offers.\nApart from live activities, Netflix's advertising division is expanding quickly. Up from 40 million in Maya 75% increasethe network has attained 70 million monthly active users worldwide in its ad-supported tier two years after its introduction.

          "whole_article": "By Amy Tennery and Dawn Chmielewski\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A showdown between former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and social media influencer-turned-fighter Jake Paul on Friday is the latest one-two punch from Netflix, as the media giant hopes to cash in on sports' sprint to streaming.\nThe intergenerational showdown has all the makings of a crossover hit, with 58-year-old Tyson bringing in the old guard and 27-year-old Paul, who achieved early fame on YouTube, appealing to the younger, screen-toting social media junkies.\nAvailable to all of Netflix's more than 280 million subscribers for no additional fee, it could be a welcome change for American boxing fans accustomed to shelling out extra to watch marquee matches on long-time broadcaster HBO.\n\"The trend in all sports right now is moving some of their properties to streaming,\" said Bob Dorfman, a veteran San Francisco-based sports marketing analyst.\n\"This is two huge personalities - it does have the potential to be the biggest streaming sports event.\"\nThe American subscription television network HBO announced in 2018 it was dropping live boxing from its programming, ending a 45-year relationship with the sport and leaving a broadcasting vacuum in its wake.\nNetflix has dabbled in sports content before, with exhibition golf and tennis events and the wildly popular docuseries \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive,\" which is credited with boosting the auto racing circuit's popularity in the U.S.\nThe fight at the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, its first live boxing event, works in favor of Netflix's strategy of providing proprietary content that viewers cannot find elsewhere.\nWhile the fight will not have traditional advertising, it has sponsors whose messages will be part of the live streamed event.\nAdvertising is not a major contributor to the streamer's current revenue, though its ad-supported tier is quickly growing, with 70 million subscribers reported this week, up from 40 million in May.\nThe mega-event is the sign of a lasting love affair between sport and streaming, said Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports, though he predicts streaming and traditional broadcast will exist side-by-side for the foreseeable future.\n\"This is a one-time-only event... It's more as a novelty in my view. It doesn't change the industry,\" said Pilson, president of Pilson Communications.\n\"The industry is still going to be driven by the league deals (like) MLS, NFL, Major League Baseball.\"\nAmazon Prime picked up Thursday Night Football in 2021 and MLS signed a 10-year mega-deal with Apple TV in 2022 worth a reported $2.5 billion.\nStory Continues\nMajor League Baseball signed a deal with Apple for \"Friday Night Baseball,\" a weekly doubleheader, in 2022, as well.\nLeagues have been gravitating to streaming both because it reaches a global audience, including younger viewers, who are not watching traditional television.\nMLS Commissioner Don Garber said the Apple streaming platform allows MLS to better take advantage of the sport's global fanbase.\n\"We were seeing the difficulty of getting an audience and getting the economics right with local and regional television - we saw that in 2018,\" Garber said this week at the Paley International Council Summit.\n\"We wanted to go to the market with a global package... We have a subscription that's global, every one of our 600 games is treated like 'Monday Night Football'.\"\n(Reporting by Amy Tennery in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

          "whole_article": "Disney's (DIS) box office magic is back, and that's taking its stock to one of the happiest places on Earth for investors.\nShares of Disney surged 9% in early trading on Thursday following a solid quarterly earnings beat and upbeat long-term guidance. The company's ticker page was the No. 1 most active on the Yahoo Finance platform.\nThe advance takes Disney's stock up about 23% year to date, outperforming the 16% gain for the Dow.\n\"I do think that the focus on raising the bar on quality and delivering, really, I think the best content in the industry is an indication that the magic is back at Disney,\" Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief (video above).\nThe financial performance of Disney's entertainment business stole the show, no pun intended. Its sales surged 14% on the back of strong performances from Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine. Operating profits hit $1.1 billion, up from $236 million a year ago.\nJohnston believes the momentum is poised to continue with key franchise releases of Moana 2 and the Lion King coming up.\nThe company's parks and linear TV businesses continue to be challenged for several reasons, however.\nSales in Disney's experiences segment \u2014 which houses the global theme park business \u2014 only rose 1% year over year as cautious consumers kept a lid on spending. Operating income fell 5%. Attendance was relatively unchanged year over year.\nJohnston said the parks business is beyond its low point and that he doesn't think venues such as Shanghai Disney would get roped into a potential Trump administration trade war with China.\n\"We're about bringing smiles to people's faces. We're about creating moments for families. We're about creating joy. That's not a political thing by any stretch of the imagination. And frankly, I think most political leaders would look at Disney and say, you know what? That's something that I want to make sure our citizens get to enjoy,\" Johnston explained.\nAs for the linear TV network business \u2014 which includes ABC and ESPN \u2014 sales and profits dropped 6% and 38%, respectively.\nThe company has undergone rounds of layoffs in its TV business over the past year, but the shift to streaming continues to be fast and furious \u2014 likely requiring deeper cost cuts.\nJohnston says he ran the numbers for CEO Bob Iger, and it makes more sense to stay in the traditional TV business.\n\"I think the core for us is really the content creation that comes out of our networks. It plays across both distribution channels, and that's really the most important thing,\" Johnston added.\nStory Continues\nDespite the weak areas of Disney's vast portfolio, investors appear to be latching on to the view that a rebound in the entertainment business and a more cost-focused Disney is all that matters right now.\n\"Stepping back, we continue to like the medium-term story for Disney, save for linear networks where expectations we think are set appropriately and ongoing cost cuts could help to soften the rate of decline. Content performance is strong with film releases year to date performing at or well beyond previous franchise iterations, which should fuel demand for Disney+ ahead of a password share crackdown and price increase,\" said JPMorgan analyst David Karnovsky in a client note.\nKarnovsky said Disney's renewed success at the box office provides \"confidence\" in further momentum around upcoming releases. He rates Disney shares at Overweight, or the equivalent of a Buy.\nThe earnings rundown\nNet sales: $22.6 billion, +6% from the prior year, vs. $22.47 billion estimate\nEntertainment revenue: $10.8 billion, +14% year over year, vs. $10.66 billion estimate\nDirect to consumer revenue: $5.78 billion, +15% year over year, vs. $5.82 billion estimate\nSports revenue: $3.91 billion, flat year over year, vs. $3.95 billion estimate\nExperiences revenue: $8.24 billion, +1% year over year, vs. $8.2 billion estimate\nDisney+ subscribers: 158.6 million vs. 156.82 million estimate\nTotal operating income: $3.7 billion, +23% year over year, vs. $3.71 billion estimate\nAdjusted EPS: $1.14, up 39% from the prior year vs. $1.10 estimate\nWhat else caught our attention: Forward comments\nFY25 Outlook\nHigh-single-digit percentage adjusted EPS growth (consensus: +19.8%)\nFY26 Outlook\nDouble-digit percentage adjusted EPS growth (consensus: +12%)\nFY27 Outlook\nDouble-digit percentage adjusted EPS growth (consensus: +10%)\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has tumbled 36% from its 52-week high of $211 in March and trades around $135 as of writing. The decline has been driven by disappointing earnings and guidance that fell short of Wall Street expectations. This dip has some investors wondering if now is the time to buy AMD on the cheap. However, a closer look at AMD's competitive position and growth prospects compared to rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) suggests the choice may not be so clear-cut.\nWhy Has AMD Stock Declined?\nBefore we get into why AMD stock declined, let's first take a glance at its Q3 results.\nHowever, the Q4 guidance disappointed analysts:\nForecasted Q4 revenues between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, below the consensus estimate of $7.55 billion.\nThis guidance miss caused a 13% stock drop over two trading days.\nThese headwinds have soured market sentiment on AMD in the near term despite the company still growing revenue by 18% year-over-year in Q3. The question is whether the 36% pullback represents a buying opportunity for a quality company facing temporary issues or a sign of tougher times ahead. But first, let's look at what kind of competition AMD is facing.\nHow Does AMD Stack Up Against Nvidia?\nNvidia is AMD's biggest competitor\u2014we can all agree on that. That said, there are some differing opinions about how both companies could end up in the long run.\nNvidia is focusing more on high-margin AI chips, whereas AMD is trying to undercut it and offer more value. I personally see it as something copied from AMD's playbook in the CPU market\u2014where AMD slowly and methodically caught up to Intel\u2014but it never managed to dominate it.\nNvidia currently has an edge over AMD in the high-end GPU market. It has AI features like DLSS but, AMD offers very competitive performance for the price with its RX 7000 series, especially in the mid-range.\nNvidia holds a clear lead with its GeForce RTX series\u2014particularly the RTX 4090\u2014in terms of raw gaming power and ray tracing capabilities. AMD\u2019s Ryzen processors are highly competitive but do not challenge Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the GPU space.\nBut again, this doesn't really matter much. Analysts care much more about dedicated AI products than anything related to gaming.\nNvidia also leads here with its H200 Tensor Core GPUs, which are widely adopted for large-scale AI training tasks. AMD\u2019s Instinct MI300X is competitive but still lags behind Nvidia in terms of market share.\nCurrent AI Product Stack (as of November 2024)\nFeature\nAMD Instinct MI300X\nNvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU\nMemory Capacity\n192GB HBM3\n141GB HBM3e\nMemory Bandwidth\n5.3TB/s\n4.8TB/s\nArchitecture\nAMD CDNA 3\nNvidia Hopper\nAI Performance (FP8)\nUp to 5,229 TFLOPS with sparsity\nUp to 3,958 TFLOPS with sparsity\nHPC Performance (FP64)\nUp to 81.72 TFLOPS\nUp to 34 TFLOPS\nPower Consumption (TDP)\nUp to 750W\nUp to 700W\nTarget Use Case\nGenerative AI, HPC, AI training/inference\nGenerative AI, HPC, AI training/inference\nAMD Instinct MI300X: The price of the AMD MI300X AI accelerator ranges between $10,000 and $15,000 depending on the customer and volume of purchase. For instance, Microsoft reportedly pays around $10,000 per unit.\nStory Continues\nAdvantages: Higher memory capacity (192GB vs. Nvidia's 141GB). Solid for large-scale AI models like GPT-3 or PaLM.\nGreater memory bandwidth (5.3TB/s) allows faster data transfer for memory-intensive tasks.\nSuperior peak theoretical performance in AI workloads, particularly in FP8 precision, making it highly efficient for large-scale generative AI tasks.\nHigher HPC performance in FP64 precision makes it more suitable for scientific simulations and other high-performance computing tasks.\nDisadvantages: Higher power consumption (750W vs. Nvidia\u2019s 700W). But again, this can be offset by the lower cost of the chip itself.\nAMD\u2019s ROCm software stack is still behind Nvidia\u2019s CUDA in terms of maturity and optimization for AI workloads. This makes it harder for developers to switch from Nvidia\u2019s established ecosystem.\nIt also struggles with lower precision tasks like FP8. These are critical for AI training and inference. Nvidia\u2019s H100 and H200 are better optimized here.\nNvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU: The Nvidia H200 is priced significantly higher than the MI300X. It is estimated to cost around $30,000 to $40,000.\nAdvantages: As I said, it has lower power consumption (700W).\nStrong inference performance, particularly in handling large language models like Llama2 with high throughput and efficiency.\nBetter optimization for specific use cases like long input sequences and batch processing. Chatbots run a lot faster.\nDisadvantages: Lower memory capacity and bandwidth compared to the MI300X, which may limit its performance on extremely large models or memory-intensive tasks.\nSlightly lower peak theoretical performance in AI workloads compared to the MI300X.\nFuture Product Stack\nFeature/Aspect\nAMD Upcoming Products\nNvidia Upcoming Products\nKey Consumer CPUs\nRyzen X3D Processors\nGeForce RTX 50-Series (Blackwell)\nExpected Release Date\nJanuary CES 2025\nJanuary-March CES/Q1-2025\nPerformance Expectations\nSignificant gaming performance boost via X3D cache technology\nA major leap in ray tracing and CUDA core count; GDDR7 memory for higher bandwidth\nKey Data Center GPUs\nInstinct MI325X\nBlackwell-based AI GPUs\nMemory Bandwidth\nUp to 6TB/s (HBM3e)\nExpected improvements over Hopper architecture\nFrom what I can see: AMD\u2019s MI325X will bring higher memory capacity and bandwidth, making it a strong contender against Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell-based GPUs. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem will probably still give it an edge.\nIt'll cost much more, though. Blackwell B100 could cost $30,000 to $35,000, whereas MI325X is estimated to be around $15,000-$20,000. Nvidia's GB200 Superchip could be even more expensive around $60,000 to $70,000.\nAMD is \"closing\" the gap with its upcoming releases\u2014especially in the data center segment\u2014but Nvidia remains dominant across both consumer and enterprise markets right now. I really don't see it changing anytime soon.\nWhy?\nNvidia\u2019s CUDA software ecosystem is a major reason customers stick with Nvidia GPUs. CUDA has become the industry standard for AI development. Switching from CUDA to AMD's ROCm involves significant effort and retraining of teams, and AMD will have to work overtime to convince customers to do that.\nComparing the Financials\nNvidia is growing faster and is more profitable than AMD. Last quarter (Q2), Nvidia grew revenue by 122.4% to $30 billion with a 55.3% net margin. AMD currently has an 11.31% net margin in Q3, and the gap will likely widen once Nvidia reports Q3 figures next week. Here's what you should know for now:\nNote: Q3 numbers for Nvidia are estimates, as per my research.\nDoes AMD Offer More Value Than Nvidia?\nValuation is more subjective these days as AI has thrown a curveball into how Wall Street slaps a premium on certain companies. AMD is\u2014and probably will be\u2014valued less than Nvidia, both in terms of market cap and how the broader market sees it. Thus, AMD stock trading at 28 times forward earnings against Nvidia's 38 times forward earnings doesn't necessarily make it cheaper.\nIn fact, I would argue that AMD fares worse here. A lower P/E ratio does not necessarily mean better value. Nvidia\u2019s higher multiple is justified by its dominance in AI chips and its rapid revenue growth in this segment. Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market, which is expected to grow to $400 billion annually within five years. In contrast, AMD is still playing catch-up in AI\u2014as we looked at before.\nWhat do analysts say?\nNonetheless, I still don't think AMD is a \"better\" choice per se. Nvidia has been surprising analysts again and again in the past few quarters. Unless that changes in the coming quarter(s), I don't think AMD stock offers more value compared to NVDA stock.\nThe Bottom Line\nIn terms of pure value\u2014considering upside potential relative to the current price\u2014AMD stock appears to offer more value than NVDA stock at this moment. NVDA stock remains an excellent long-term play for those focused on stability and leadership in AI, but\u2014if you take price targets seriously\u2014AMD stock provides a better risk-reward balance for investors willing to bet on its continued progress in catching up with Nvidia.\nIn my opinion, you should hold both if you want exposure to AI, but NVDA stock should comprise more of that pie.\nWhile I acknowledge the potential of both AMD and NVDA as AI plays, my conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.\u00a0If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: Why is QUBT Stock up 400%?

As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA\nHow Much Debt Does NVIDIA Carry?\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NVIDIA had debt of US$8.46b at the end of July 2024, a reduction from US$9.71b over a year. But on the other hand it also has US$34.8b in cash, leading to a US$26.3b net cash position.\nNasdaqGS:NVDA Debt to Equity History November 16th 2024\nA Look At NVIDIA's Liabilities\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$14.0b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$13.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$34.8b and US$14.1b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$21.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nHaving regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$3.60t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that NVIDIA has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\nEven more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 459% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NVIDIA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\nStory Continues\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth 79% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\nSumming Up\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case NVIDIA has US$26.3b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And we liked the look of last year's 459% year-on-year EBIT growth. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for NVIDIA (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

A new report by management consulting firm Gartner sheds expert light on the matter, AI and GenAI are driving rapid increases in electricity consumption, with data center forecasts over the next two years reaching as high as 160% growth. Gartner claims that 40% of existing AI data centers will be operationally constrained by power availability by 2027. Research from the company indicates that the power required for data centers to run incremental AI-optimized servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year in 2027, which is 2.6 times the level in 2023.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nBob Johnson, VP Analyst at Gartner, has said that the explosive growth of new hyperscale data centers to implement GenAI is creating an insatiable demand for power that will exceed the ability of utility providers to expand their capacity fast enough. In turn, per Johnson, this threatens to disrupt energy availability and lead to shortages, which will limit the growth of new data centers for GenAI and other uses from 2026. He added that short-term power shortages are likely to continue for years as new power transmission, distribution and generation capacity could take years to come online and won\u2019t alleviate current problems.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nData is at the forefront of many inventions today and is the primary ingredient of innovation. Of the many branches of data usage, predictive analytics is garnering immense traction, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistics, modeling, and machine learning to forecast, predict, and plan future events. There are different types of predictive analytics including regression analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics market was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023. The global predictive analytics market is expected to grow to $95.3 billion by 2032 from $18.02 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%. The report attributes the growth in the industry to the growing investments in data by the government and large corporations followed by IoT and AI integrations. The use of predictive analytics is bifurcated into multiple segments including life sciences, automotive, retail, energy, telecom, and healthcare, to name a few.\nStartups Disrupting the Predictive Analytics Space\nThere are a range of startups in the predictive analytics space that are revolutionizing the industry. One such name is Pecan AI. The automated predictive analytics platform is developed and designed intricately to meet the needs of data scientists. Data scientists can use the platform to build powerful predictive AI capabilities and machine learning models that drive business impact. Data scientists do not need coding or data science skills to make use of the platform. The platform is used by a range of companies including Johnson & Johnson, SciPlay, Hydrant, Kenvue, Proper Cloth, and DME Acquire. Earlier in January, the company introduced predictive generative AI to transform enterprises. Pecan AI also has partnerships with some of the largest tech corporations and platforms including Azure and AWS.\nDataRobot is another leader in the predictive analytics industry that delivers revolutionary AI use cases for businesses. Its AI platform consists of core AI features such as generative AI, predictive AI, AI governance, AI observability, and AI foundation. The platform promises 83% faster deployment and secures nearly 1.4 billion predictions every day. Users can run models in minutes by skipping manual data preparation and cleaning. Additionally, the platform eliminates the need for repetitive coding, by streamlining feature discovery and defining elements of datasets automatically. Users can connect data from warehouses such as AWS and Azure into a singular workspace. Some of the predictive use cases facilitated by DataRobot include time series modeling, clustering and seasonality, cold start forecasting, nowcasting, and anomaly detection.\nStory Continues\nNow that we have studied the predictive analytics industry and some revolutionary startups, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now we went through multiple reports on the internet, ETFs, and stock screeners. We then examined the analyst upside of each stock and ranked the ones with the highest percentage. Our list is in ascending order of the analyst upside as of November 11, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Predictive Analytics Stock to Invest in Now?\nA team of actuaries and engineers at a computer looking at the data and finding the best reinsurance solution for a client.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nAnalyst upside as of November 11, 2024: 16%\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that ranks fifth on our list of the best predictive analytics stocks to invest in. It owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo.\nThe company is a pioneer in data analytics and has been making use of predictive metrics in Google Analytics for years now. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers a range of solutions where predictive analytics comes into play. For example, its data science solution consists of a complete suite of data management, analytics, and machine learning tools that help entities garner insights from data and generate value. In addition to that, its marketing analytics solution helps companies significantly improve the overall customer journey and experience using crucial insights from existing data.\nBusinesses can use the myriad of tools available at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to simply develop machine-learning models that are able to recognize and identify patterns in datasets and provide crucial insights to entities. On the AI front, BigQuery, Google\u2019s AI-optimized data analytics platform is developed to make data analysis easier and faster. Users can create large language models using enterprise data without having to copy or move data from elsewhere to someplace else.\nOverall, Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) breadth of tools and expertise is challenging to replicate, positioning the company as one of the leaders in data management and analytics. Analysts also favor the stock and their median price target implies an upside of 16% from current levels, as of November 11.\nPolen Capital\u00a0Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon were also top absolute detractors. Alphabet\u2019s better-than-expected results were overshadowed by an adverse ruling related to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (\u201cDoJ\u201d) anti-trust case against the company. We expected an adverse ruling and are monitoring potential remedies recommended by the DoJ and subsequently ruled on by the judge. This will likely take a few years to play out; in the meantime, we see many mitigating factors that the company can pursue to protect its competitive position and growth. We trimmed our positions in Alphabet and Microsoft by 1.5% each to fund the purchase of Oracle. They both remain top five holdings at the new weights.\u201d\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 5th on our list of best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Similarly, the Tesla TSLA stock soared due to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s all-in support for Trump.\nOverall, the technology industry is preparing for potential shifts in policy as Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. His administration is expected to address issues like antitrust, AI regulation, and the CHIPS Act, with major implications for Big Tech.\nAntitrust Regulation: Shift Away From Biden's Approach?\nUnder the Biden administration, antitrust measures targeted big players like Google, Amazon, and Apple, with the FTC attempting to curb their market dominance. Trump, however, has indicated a more lenient stance on breaking up Big Tech. This could affect ongoing cases against Big Tech, including efforts to break up Alphabet\u2019s Google GOOGL due to its dominance in online search.\nWhile Trump is likely to continue several antitrust cases against major tech companies \u2014 many of which began during his first term \u2014 he recently expressed skepticism about a potential Google breakup. In October, Trump questioned whether dismantling Google would harm the company too severely.\nA Boon for Artificial Intelligence?\nGenerative AI has surged in relevance since Trump\u2019s first term. The Trump administration had previously made concerted efforts in promoting artificial intelligence (AI). He signed the American AI Initiative executive order on Feb. 11, 2019. The order pledged to double AI research investment and established the first set of national AI research institutes.\nThe order also included a plan for AI technical standards and established guidance for the federal government\u2019s use of AI. Trump also signed an executive order on Dec. 3, 2020, promoting the use of trustworthy AI in the federal government. It shows that AI stocks and ETFs should have great days during Trump\u2019s ruling (read: 4 Sector ETFs to Gain on Trump's Triumph).\nTech companies are increasingly calling for standardized regulation to avoid a confusing patchwork of state rules. The Biden administration\u2019s recent executive order sought to balance AI growth with safety measures. In contrast, Trump\u2019s deregulation tendencies could mean fewer restrictions on AI development. However, Elon Musk, who expressed concerns about unchecked AI growth, may encourage Trump to consider some form of flexible regulation.\nThe CHIPS Act and Potential Tariffs\nBiden\u2019s CHIPS Act, which provides $52.7 billion for domestic semiconductor production, may face scrutiny. Though Trump is unlikely to repeal it, he might streamline funding and reduce regulatory hurdles. However, he\u2019s also suggested imposing tariffs on imported chips to spur domestic production, a move that could increase the cost of goods with imported chips and impact various tech products, from consumer electronics to enterprise AI hardware.\nStory Continues\nAny Threats for Big Techs?\nConsistent Antitrust Enforcement Expected\nWhile Trump may revise some policies, a full-blown reduction in antitrust enforcement is not likely. Note that the Trump administration brought a comparable number of merger cases to the Biden administration during his first term, according to an analysis by the Sheppard Mullin law firm, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nChina Plays a Crucial Role in Big Tech\u2019s Fortune\nTrump\u2019s first term is famous for slapping tariffs on China. He\u2019s threatened to slap China with 60-100% tariffs on goods, so the risk of a global trade war looms. Any trade war with China is a negative for big techs. Apple and Tesla, especially, depend a lot on the Chinese market and supply chains. Apple\u2019s manufacturing relies heavily on Chinese facilities, while Tesla considers China as one of its fastest-growing markets.\nTech ETFs in Focus\nIn a nutshell, the scenario is mixed-to-bullish for big tech stocks. Investors may continue to play top-ranked technology-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH, First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY, iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF IGM and First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF FDN. All these tech ETFs hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (see all technology ETFs here).\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As the initial euphoria of market participants is over, investors are assessing the pros and cons of Trump\u2019s economic policies, such as the imposition of tariffs, reduction of corporate taxes, deregulation of corporate America and their impact on inflation.\nThe technology sector is also concerned about Trump\u2019s tariffs on high-end chipsets, the future of the $52.5 billion Chips and Science Act and the imposition of antitrust regulations on big techs. Nevertheless, I believe that the AI frenzy will continue as this technology has become the need of the hour.\nAt this stage, we recommend five generative artificial intelligence (AI) behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank that have double-digit upside potential in the short term. These are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nAI Frenzy Remains Intact\nThe astonishing rally of U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative AI technology across the world was the prime factor.\nBloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending will increase from $67 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. UBS estimated that four U.S. technology giants that are member of the so-called \u201cmagnificent 7\u201d will spend around $267 billion as capital expenditure on AI applications in 2025, a jump of 33.5% year over year.\n5 AI Bigwigs to Buy With Double-Digit Short-Term Appreciation\nEach of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI (Gen AI) solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products. GOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance search results continue to boost traffic on GOOGL\u2019s search engine.\nStory Continues\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 17.6% from the last closing price of $175.58. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $185-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 36.7% and no downside.\nMeta Platforms Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Meta Platforms is set to receive initial shipments of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s (NVDA) new flagship AI chip later this year. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META is set to get B200 Blackwell chips.\nMETA\u2019s AI-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms. Management said that the company will invest $38-$40 billion as capital expenditure in AI initiatives in 2024. Moreover, capital spending is likely to reach more than $50 billion in 2025.\nOn July 24, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA\u2019s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbents like Open AI.\nStrong Price Upside Potential for META Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $577.16. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $475-$811. This indicates a maximum upside of 40.5% and a maximum downside of 17.7%.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\nZacks Rank #1 Taiwan Semiconductor is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world\u2019s best AI chipset developers. It has a strong clientele. The company is the largest manufacturer of NVIDIA\u2019s chipsets. NVIDIA is globally the largest developer of generative AI-based chips.\nTSM provides a range of wafer fabrication processes, including processes to manufacture complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, embedded memory, bipolar CMOS mixed-signal, and others.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is experiencing solid demand for its advanced technologies, such as 3-nanometer (nm) and 5nm. The growing adoption of its multi-project wafer processing service, which allows customers to reduce mask costs, is driving its customer momentum.\nTSM\u2019s growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus. Also, strength across its 7nm, 16nm and 28nm technologies are contributing well to its top-line growth.\nExcellent Price Upside Potential for TSM Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19.2% from the last closing price of $188.50. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $200-$250. This indicates a maximum upside of 32.6% and no downside.\nAdobe Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Adobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster.\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\nAttractive Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.4% from the last closing price of $529.87. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703. This indicates a maximum upside of 32.7% and a maximum downside of 17%.\nBroadcom Inc.\nBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers. AVGO\u2019s solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers.\nThe acquisition of VMware has benefited the infrastructure software solutions of Broadcom. VMware\u2019s expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy. AVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\nSolid Price Upside Potential for AVGO Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 12.5% from the last closing price of $170.38. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $150-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 40.9% and a maximum downside of 12%.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

          "whole_article": "This earnings season may be winding down but there are still a number of big-name companies reporting in the coming week.\nAll eyes will be on chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), as investors eagerly await its latest quarterly results, to see if it can deliver another set of strong results as a gauge of the AI boom.\nInvestors will also be looking to see if US retailer Walmart (WMT) can deliver another set of results that beats Wall Street's expectations.\nMeanwhile, tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMB.L) is scheduled to release its full-year results, with investors hoping for another increase to its dividend.\nMarkets will be hoping that sportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) can maintain its full-year guidance when it reports in the coming week.\nInvestors will also be keeping a close eye on Royal-Mail-owner International Distribution Services (IDS.L), for any details in its results as to how its agreed takeover led by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky is progressing.\nHere's more on what to look out for:\nNvidia (NVDA) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Wednesday 20 November\nChipmaker Nvidia's latest quarterly results are set to draw much of the market focus this week, having become a bellweather for how the global push in AI is faring.\nNvidia will also round off earnings releases from the Magnificent 7 tech behemoths as the last of the group to report this season, with Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA), having already published results.\nThe demand for Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has continued to propel its shares higher, with the stock up 196% year-to-date. The recent rise in its shares pushed Nvidia to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.6tn (\u00a32.8tn).\nShares rose earlier this week after Nvidia said that Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) would be the first to receive its AI Blackwell chips.\nThis came as part of a series of collaborations with SoftBank that Nvidia announced on Tuesday.\nRead more: How Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote speech at the chipmaker's AI Summit in Japan, that SoftBank would be using its Blackwell platform to build Japan's most powerful AI supercomputer.\nIn addition, Nvidia also revealed that SoftBank, using the chipmaker's AI Aerial computing platform, had piloted the world's first combined AI and 5G telecom network.\nThe attention now turns to Nvidia's third-quarter results for its 2025 fiscal year, with the chipmaker having guided to revenue of $32.5bn, plus or minus 2%, for the period in its previous quarterly report.\nStory continues\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Markets forecasts expect that number to be a little higher. If NVIDIA continues its strong run of beating market expectations, things could be better still.\"\n\"There\u2019s likely to be more emphasis however on the outlook for the final three months of the year, where consensus is currently looking for revenue of $36.6bn.\"\nIn the second quarter, revenue came in at $30bn, which was 122% higher than the previous year. Nvidia posted earnings per diluted share of $0.67, which was up 168% on the previous year.\n\"Any steer as to how well the recently launched ultra-fast Blackwell chip is selling will also be closely scrutinised,\" Nathan said.\n\"There\u2019s no shortage of demand as the likes of Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) look to gain an edge in the AI race. But there remain some unanswered questions about Nvidia\u2019s supply chain\u2019s ability to keep pace.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nWalmart (WMT) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Tuesday 19 November\nWall Street will keeping an eye on retailer Walmart's latest results to see if it reports another solid quarter, as consumer price pressures persist.\nLatest data showed consumer prices grew by 2.6% in October, which was a slight uptick for the 2.4% rate of inflation recorded in September.\nThe figure was still above the US Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target but was in line with with expectations, sustaining investor hopes that the central bank will potentially cut interest rates again in December.\nHowever, there are concerns that potential policies around trade tariffs from president-elect Donald Trump, after he returns to the White House in January, could drive inflation higher.\nAs the world's largest retailer by sales, Walmart's results can provide an insight into US consumer sentiment.\nRead more: UK growth slows between July and September as services sector falters\nIn the second quarter, Walmart (WMT) logged revenue growth of 4.8% of $169.34bn, beating estimates of $168.46bn.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.67 also beat expectations of $0.65 and marked a 9.8% increase year-on-year.\nThis strong performance contributed to a 61% rise in Walmart shares year-to-date.\nCEO Doug McMillon said: \"Each part of our business is growing \u2013 store and club sales are up, e-commerce is compounding as we layer on pickup and even faster growth in delivery as our speed improves.\"\nFor the third quarter, Walmart guided to an increase of 3.25% to 4.25% in consolidated net sales, compared with the same period last year when it delivered $159.4bn in net sales.\nWalmart said it was expecting consolidated operating income to rise between 3% and 4.5% in the third quarter, up from $6.2bn last year.\nThe company expected adjusted earnings per share to come in at $0.51 to $0.52, compared with $0.51 for the third quarter last year.\n\u2022 USD\n(WMT)\nFollow\nView quote details\nImperial Brands (IMB.L) \u2014 Reports full-year results on Tuesday 19 November\nShares in tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMB.L) are currently trading at a five-year high, with the stock up 31% year-to-date.\nThat's despite the higher duties on cigarettes and vapes announced in the recent UK autumn budget.\n\"These moves add to a long list of regulatory and tax measures designed to deter consumers from smoking, after interventions on advertising and packaging design,\" said AJ Bell's Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth.\nEven so, the investment experts said that Imperial Brands continues to see strong profits and cash generation, much of which could be attributed to the five-year plan set out by CEO Stefan Bomhard, who took the reins in 2020.\nIn its full year results last year, Imperial Brands posted a 7.1% decline in tobacco volumes (excluding Russia), but the company raised its prices by an average of 11%. Sales in its next generation product segment rose 26%.\nRead more: Rachel Reeves hints at looser regulation in bid to improve UK's competitiveness\n\"Imperial will be looking to a similar recipe in the year to September 2024, for which chief executive Stefan Bomhard gave clear guidance alongside the full-year results for 2023 back in November,\" said Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth.\nIn its half-year results, Imperial Brands said it expected to deliver revenue growth in the low-single digits on a constant currency basis for its tobacco and next generation products segments.\nThe company forecast that adjusted operating profit would grow by close to the middle of its mid-single digit range.\nOn the back of this guidance, AJ Bell's investment experts said that analysts were expecting group adjusted operating profit of \u00a33.9bn, which would be flat on the previous year.\nAnalysts were also said to be expecting adjusted earnings per share of \u00a32.95, up from \u00a32.79 last year.\nIn terms of its dividend, Imperial Brands has produced three consecutive increases in the payout, with analysts said to be looking for another advance to \u00a31.53 per share in this set of results. The company also recently announced a further share buyback of \u00a31.25bn, which it is set to complete by the end of October 2025.\n\u2022 USD\n(IMB.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nJD Sports (JD.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter trading update on Thursday 21 November\nSportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) had a tougher start to its fiscal year but Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the situation has since picked up for the business. However, shares in the company are still down nearly 29% year-to-date.\nIn its interim results, JD Sports logged 5% growth in revenue to \u00a35.03bn, while profit before tax and adjusting items was up 2% to \u00a3405.6m.\n\"It was pleasing to see Europe, North America and Asia Pacific markets all posting double-digit sales growth,\" said Chiekrie. \"But the UK market remains challenging and volatile, and full-year profit guidance got a small downgrade as a result.\"\nHe said that JD Sports was trying to offset these challenges by \"tightening its belt and streamlining operations\".\nRead more: December UK interest rate cut unlikely despite GDP slowdown\n\"Investors will be hoping that means there won\u2019t be further downgrades to the full-year outlook in next week's results,\" he said.\nChiekrie said that investors would also be wanting to see how its takeover of US sporting goods supplier Hibbett is progressing, having completed the acquisition in July.\n\"The deal has substantially increased the group\u2019s footprint in the US, but there\u2019s a lot of work to do to make sure a deal of this size pulls in the expected benefits,\" he said.\nIn terms of its UK business, Andy Higginson, who is both chair of JD Sports and the British Retail Consortium, recently warned that tax rises on businesses announced in the autumn budget would result in prices to rise for shoppers.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the budget that employers would have to pay 15% in national insurance on salaries over \u00a35,000, rising from the current rate of 13.8% on salaries over \u00a39,100.\n\"I'm guaranteeing you today, if these go through as they are without any sort of feathering, we\u2019re going to see significant inflation in prices,\" Higginson said on the BBC's Today programme.\n\u2022 USD\n(JD.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nInternational Distribution Services (IDS.L) \u2014 Reports interim results on Thursday 21 November\nThe focus for investors in Royal Mail-owner International Distribution Services will be on the takeover of the company led by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.\nIDS agreed to the \u00a33.57bn takeover offer back in May, with the offer made through a special purpose vehicle, EP UK Bidco Limited, owned by J&T Capital Partners and EP Corporate Group. Kretinsky is the majority owner of EP Corporate Group.\nKeith Williams, the chair of IDS, said that the company's board had negotiated a \"far reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments which provide our customers, employees and broader stakeholders with important safeguards.\"\nRead more: What does the launch of pension megafunds mean for investors?\nMeanwhile, Kretinsky said: \"The EP Group has the utmost respect for Royal Mail's history and tradition, and I know that owning this business will come with enormous responsibility \u2013 not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day.\"\nIn terms of its company performance, IDS said that total parcels volumes were up 11% in its first quarter. Meanwhile, revenue across the IDS group had risen 8% to \u00a33.2bn.\nIn September, regulator Ofcom said it was considering changes to the UK postal service for Royal Mail. This included the potential scrapping of second class letter deliveries on Saturdays.\nHowever, a decision had not yet been made, with Ofcom saying it expected to consult on proposals for reform in early 2025, with a view to announcing a decision in summer 2025.\nIDS reportedly said that the \u201cchange cannot come soon enough\u201d to the UK postal service.\n\u2022 USD\n(IDS.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nOther companies reporting next week include:\nMonday 18 November\nBig Yellow (BYG.L)\nSirius Real Estate (SRE.L)\nTuesday 19 November\nDiploma (DPLM.L)\nAvon Protection (AVNBF)\nCML Microsystems (CML.L)\nRevolution Beauty (REVB.L)\nGB Group (GBG.L)\nGear4Music (G4M.L)\nXiaomi (1810.HK)\nSonova (SONVY)\nThyssenKrupp (TKA.DE)\nLowe\u2019s (LOW)\nMedtronic (MDT)\nDollar Tree (DLTR)\nAmer Sports (AS)\nDolby Laboratories (DLB)\nWednesday 20 November\nSage (SGE.L)\nMitchells & Butlers (MAB.L)\nTracsis (TRCS.L)\nRotork (ROR.L)\nSoftcat (SCT.L)\nBaloise (BALN.SW)\nSoitec (SLOIF)\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW)\nTarget (TGT)\nSnowflake (SNOW)\nNio (NIO)\nThursday 21 November\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\nGrainger (GRI.L)\nJet2 (JET2.L)\nMitie (MTO.L)\nSpeedy Hire (SDY.L)\nNorcros (NXR.L)\nWarehouse REIT (WHR.L)\nCrest Nicholson (CRST.L)\nBreedon (BREE.L)\nBaidu (BIDU)\nIntuit (INTU)\nPDD (PDD)\nWarner Music (WMG)\nGap (GAP)\nFriday 22 November\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\nMeituan (3690.HK)\nCathay Pacific Airways (CPCAF)\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\nRead more on stocks:\nTrending tickers: Tesla, Alibaba, Pfizer, Domino's and Disney\nFTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win\nHow Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nNYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nIn Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThere\u2019s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump\u2019s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.\nBut there\u2019s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate \u2014 especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect \u2014 and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.\nThese cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk\u2019s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up less than 1%, while Facebook parent Meta is down 0.6%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 3.5%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 2%.\nAs the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they\u2019re thinking about. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying:\nTiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:\n\u201cTariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.\nWe have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.\u201d\nMark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we\u2019ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.\nI don\u2019t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.\u201d\nMark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.\n\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she\u2019s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.\u201d\nThreats against Alphabet and Meta are \u201cjust talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn\u2019t take kindly to that. However, I don\u2019t think anything like this will make it into policy.\u201d\nKevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management\n\u201cTrump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn\u2019t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn\u2019t put him the best light.\nThe thing that\u2019s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That\u2019s a counter perspective to that. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren\u2019t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.\nI don\u2019t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined.

According to a report published by Bloomberg, the startup has said that the US and neighboring countries should form a North American Compact for AI that can streamline access to talent, financing and supply chains for building out the technology.

The company further urged the US to establish AI Economic Zones that speed up the permitting process and help bring nuclear reactors back online. It also proposed expanding nuclear energy capacity by tapping the US Navy, which has built compact reactors to power submarines. The company is already working with Microsoft to set up an AI fund needed to develop AI chips, energy and data centers.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +7.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +29.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.8% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +37.9%. This estimate has changed +4.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.91 indicates a change of +11.4% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $81.32 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $294.51 billion and $330.1 billion estimates indicate +14.8% and +12.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $74.55 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.55 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $72.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +15.85%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nData is at the forefront of many inventions today and is the primary ingredient of innovation. Of the many branches of data usage, predictive analytics is garnering immense traction, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistics, modeling, and machine learning to forecast, predict, and plan future events. There are different types of predictive analytics including regression analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics market was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023. The global predictive analytics market is expected to grow to $95.3 billion by 2032 from $18.02 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%. The report attributes the growth in the industry to the growing investments in data by the government and large corporations followed by IoT and AI integrations. The use of predictive analytics is bifurcated into multiple segments including life sciences, automotive, retail, energy, telecom, and healthcare, to name a few.\nStartups Disrupting the Predictive Analytics Space\nThere are a range of startups in the predictive analytics space that are revolutionizing the industry. One such name is Pecan AI. The automated predictive analytics platform is developed and designed intricately to meet the needs of data scientists. Data scientists can use the platform to build powerful predictive AI capabilities and machine learning models that drive business impact. Data scientists do not need coding or data science skills to make use of the platform. The platform is used by a range of companies including Johnson & Johnson, SciPlay, Hydrant, Kenvue, Proper Cloth, and DME Acquire. Earlier in January, the company introduced predictive generative AI to transform enterprises. Pecan AI also has partnerships with some of the largest tech corporations and platforms including Azure and AWS.\nDataRobot is another leader in the predictive analytics industry that delivers revolutionary AI use cases for businesses. Its AI platform consists of core AI features such as generative AI, predictive AI, AI governance, AI observability, and AI foundation. The platform promises 83% faster deployment and secures nearly 1.4 billion predictions every day. Users can run models in minutes by skipping manual data preparation and cleaning. Additionally, the platform eliminates the need for repetitive coding, by streamlining feature discovery and defining elements of datasets automatically. Users can connect data from warehouses such as AWS and Azure into a singular workspace. Some of the predictive use cases facilitated by DataRobot include time series modeling, clustering and seasonality, cold start forecasting, nowcasting, and anomaly detection.\nStory Continues\nNow that we have studied the predictive analytics industry and some revolutionary startups, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now we went through multiple reports on the internet, ETFs, and stock screeners. We then examined the analyst upside of each stock and ranked the ones with the highest percentage. Our list is in ascending order of the analyst upside as of November 11, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best Predictive Analytics Stock to Invest in Now?\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nAnalyst upside as of November 11, 2024: 20%\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology giant that is spending generously on artificial intelligence and data. As the company ventures into new technologies and AI, it does represent a breakthrough stock that can influence the future.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pioneering predictive analytics and we say that because of its strong data and machine learning capabilities. Azure Synapse Analytics is an analytics service that provides enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics. The platform can be run either serverless or with dedicated resources, giving users extended autonomy over their data use cases. Users can generate insights across data warehouses and big data systems. In addition to that, the platform also offers technologies for big data, log and time series analytics, data integration, and deep integration with other Azure services namely Power BI and AzureML.\nThe company is increasingly making use of artificial intelligence to unlock real-time insights. On May 21, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that users can now access real-time insights with AI-powered analytics in Microsoft Fabric, the company\u2019s new unified data analytics platform. On this incredible feat, Tammy Wigg, Chief Data Analytics Officer at Aurizon, a user of Microsoft Fabric stated:\n\u201cWith Microsoft Fabric, we\u2019ve answered many of our questions about navigating future growth, to remove legacy systems, and to streamline and simplify our architecture. A trusted data platform sets us up to undertake complex predictive analytics and optimizations that will give greater surety for our business and drive commercial benefits for Aurizon and our customers in the very near future.\u201d\nMicrosoft Fabric is a complete data platform that significantly improves real-time analytics to help users analyze high-volume data. These improvements have significantly increased the customer base for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nOverall, MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

A new report by management consulting firm Gartner sheds expert light on the matter, AI and GenAI are driving rapid increases in electricity consumption, with data center forecasts over the next two years reaching as high as 160% growth. Gartner claims that 40% of existing AI data centers will be operationally constrained by power availability by 2027. Research from the company indicates that the power required for data centers to run incremental AI-optimized servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year in 2027, which is 2.6 times the level in 2023.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nBob Johnson, VP Analyst at Gartner, has said that the explosive growth of new hyperscale data centers to implement GenAI is creating an insatiable demand for power that will exceed the ability of utility providers to expand their capacity fast enough. In turn, per Johnson, this threatens to disrupt energy availability and lead to shortages, which will limit the growth of new data centers for GenAI and other uses from 2026. He added that short-term power shortages are likely to continue for years as new power transmission, distribution and generation capacity could take years to come online and won\u2019t alleviate current problems.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Whereas, the full vision of the metaverse encompasses platforms and devices that work seamlessly with each other, the possibility for thousands of people to interact simultaneously, and use cases well beyond gaming. While the phenomenon gained attention in 2021 with internet searches for the term increasing by 7,200%, it seems here to stay. With lockdowns and work-from-home policies in place, the interest in shared virtual environments spiked. The opportunity remains vast with metaverse having the potential to generate up to $5 trillion in value by 2030.\nIs the Metaverse Still Alive?\nWhen the tech guru Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook\u2019s name to Meta in 2021, he clearly drove the metaverse narrative in the world. Although the vision of a digital future of work and recreation became a buzz for a while, other emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence decided to dominate the headlines later.\nQuestions regarding whether Zuckerberg should have transformed a successful social media company into a VR venture have also been asked. In September 2023, BBC reported that his company\u2019s virtual and augmented reality branch, Reality Labs, has lost $21 billion since the prior year. The firm later introduced its social virtual reality space Horizon Worlds. While some users have complained about not having enough people to make it fun, the platform\u2019s monthly users can simply not match the number of people who consume social media like Facebook and Instagram every day.\nAlthough the company\u2019s virtual reality headset and its Horizon Worlds have not gone mainstream after 3 years of the company\u2019s founding, experts argue that the metaverse is still as relevant as ever. On October 2, CNBC reported that Zuckerberg\u2019s metaverse is finally showing signs of life as his company might have found its footing in VR and AR through a different medium, smart glasses. After the firm witnessed early success in the market for smart glasses via a partnership with Ray-Ban, the CEO unveiled the first \u201cfully-functioning\u201d prototype AR glasses, Orion, in September.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe right way to look at Orion is as a time machine. These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\u201d\nAlthough there might be a lack of connection between the metaverse which was the next big thing two years ago and the prevailing tech landscape dominated by AI, some argue that the reports of the metaverse\u2019s death are \u2018exaggerated\u2019 and that it is a rather long-term concept to materialize as a digital future for masses.\nWith that being said, let\u2019s move to the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders:\u00a0279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) empowers people and organizations to achieve more with technology. It has segments namely Productivity and Business Processes, \u00a0Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The company is best known for its software products but it has a solid presence in other emerging domains.\nMicrosoft was one of the first in the metaverse race with its HoloLens mixed reality headset. While the firm is no longer producing its HoloLens 2 headset, it still remains in the race. Microsoft decided to make a metaverse inside Teams through Microsoft Mesh which powers 3D immersive experiences using next-generation technology that makes virtual connections seem like face-to-face interactions.\nWhile Mesh was available on PC and Meta Quest VR devices, it was announced to be generally available in Microsoft Teams in January 2024. Previously, the Mesh avatars opened the doors of workplace metaverse in Teams. Customers including Accenture, BP, and Mercy Ships are reaping the benefits of Mesh already. Additionally, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, a leader in game development and interactive entertainment content publisher. This move was seen by the company as a step towards growth in its gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud while providing building blocks for the metaverse.\nFor the FY25 Q1, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recorded revenue of $65.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year. The firm witnessed a solid start to its fiscal year, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue. Revenue in Productivity and Business Processes was up 12%, revenue in Intelligent Cloud increased 20%, and revenue in More Personal Computing rose 17%, year-over-year. Simultaneously, the firm\u2019s AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter.\nWhile the hardware aspect of Microsoft\u2019s presence in the metaverse might fade with the discontinuation of HoloLens 2, its expertise in gaming and the cloud is proven and is expected to foster the firm\u2019s foothold in the metaverse. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The stock is held by 279 hedge funds, as of 2024\u2019s second quarter.\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the other Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

The two pioneers changed the personal computer industry and how we use technology by pushing the envelope in their special ways for decades. However, when asked about his relationship with Gates in a rare joint interview, Jobs didn\u2019t respond with competitiveness or rivalry \u2013 instead, he quoted a line from a Beatles song.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date.\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nDuring the 2007 interview, Jobs and Gates reminisced about their long history in the industry. They laughed, remembering their early years when they were frequently the youngest in the room. Gates noted how it was always wonderful to see someone like Jobs persevere through the many challenges and trends offered by the rapidly changing computer sector.\nJobs, known for his passion for music, quoted The Beatles' reflective line: \"You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead,\u201d before adding, \u201cAnd that\u2019s clearly true here.\u201d\n\n\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nThe lyric from The Beatles' \"Two of Us\" song perfectly captured the sentiment. For all their competition, Jobs and Gates shared a deep mutual respect. The song is about friendship, shared memories and a sense of journey \u2013 and that's exactly how Jobs saw his connection with Gates. After all, they'd both been through the ups and downs of building billion-dollar companies, watching trends come and go and surviving the intense pressures of leading groundbreaking tech firms.\nStory Continues\nIt was a moment that showed the softer side of their relationship and that despite being rivals, Jobs and Gates weren't just competing tech CEOs \u2013 they were two individuals who'd shared a unique journey in an industry they helped to shape. Their antagonism had subsided into camaraderie based on mutual knowledge of what it required to get to where they were, shared experiences and the rare act of cooperation.\nSee Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\nBack in the late '70s and early '80s, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was working hard to get its personal computers into homes, schools and offices, aiming to make computers friendly, accessible and even stylish. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), on the other hand, was all about software under Gates\u2019 direction. Gates aimed to install Microsoft\u2019s operating system on as many machines as possible, including IBM, Apple\u2019s main rival. And a long-standing rivalry was sparked by this action.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system, introduced in 1983, was strikingly similar to Apple's Mac OS and Jobs was not happy about it. He famously accused Gates of copying Apple\u2019s interface, saying that Microsoft had no shame in borrowing ideas.\nUltimately, this brief Beatles reference from Jobs was a reminder of the humanity behind the industry giants.

The recent rise in its shares pushed Nvidia to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.6tn (\u00a32.8tn).\nShares rose earlier this week after Nvidia said that Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) would be the first to receive its AI Blackwell chips.\nThis came as part of a series of collaborations with SoftBank that Nvidia announced on Tuesday.\nRead more: How Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote speech at the chipmaker's AI Summit in Japan, that SoftBank would be using its Blackwell platform to build Japan's most powerful AI supercomputer.\nIn addition, Nvidia also revealed that SoftBank, using the chipmaker's AI Aerial computing platform, had piloted the world's first combined AI and 5G telecom network.\nThe attention now turns to Nvidia's third-quarter results for its 2025 fiscal year, with the chipmaker having guided to revenue of $32.5bn, plus or minus 2%, for the period in its previous quarterly report.\nStory continues\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Markets forecasts expect that number to be a little higher. If NVIDIA continues its strong run of beating market expectations, things could be better still.\"\n\"There\u2019s likely to be more emphasis however on the outlook for the final three months of the year, where consensus is currently looking for revenue of $36.6bn.\"\nIn the second quarter, revenue came in at $30bn, which was 122% higher than the previous year.

It seeks to void OpenAI's license with Microsoft and force them to divest \u201cill-gotten\u201d gains.\nOpenAI in a statement said the latest lawsuit \"is even more baseless and overreaching than the previous ones.\" Microsoft declined to comment.\n\"Microsoft\u2019s anticompetitive practices have escalated,\" Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement. \"Sunlight is the best disinfectant.\"\nMusk has a long-simmering opposition to OpenAI, a startup he co-founded and that has since become the face of generative AI through billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft.\nMusk has gained new prominence as a key force in U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. Trump named Musk to a new role designed to cut government waste, after he donated millions of dollars to Trump's Republican campaign.\nThe expanded lawsuit said OpenAI and Microsoft violated antitrust law by conditioning investment opportunities on agreements not to deal with the companies\u2019 rivals. It said the companies' exclusive licensing agreement amounted to a merger lacking regulatory approvals.\nIn a court filing last month, OpenAI accused Musk of pursuing the lawsuit as part of an \u201cincreasingly blusterous campaign to harass OpenAI for his own competitive advantage.\u201d\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; editing by David Bario and Jonathan Oatis)\nView Comments"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for CrowdStrike Holdings, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.012 = US$53m \u00f7 (US$7.2b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).\nThus, CrowdStrike Holdings has an ROCE of 1.2%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 9.0%.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024\nIn the above chart we have measured CrowdStrike Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CrowdStrike Holdings for free.\nWhat Can We Tell From CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE Trend?\nThe fact that CrowdStrike Holdings is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 1.2% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 439% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.\nOur Take On CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE\nIn summary, it's great to see that CrowdStrike Holdings has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CrowdStrike Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\nOne more thing, we've spotted 2 warning signs facing CrowdStrike Holdings that you might find interesting.\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD has staged an impressive comeback, with shares rallying 34% over the past three months. This surge follows the significant dip in its share price triggered by the global IT outage on July 19, 2024.\nCRWD stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry and the S&P 500 index\u2019s rise of 16.2% and 10%, respectively, in the past three months. It has also fared better than other cybersecurity players, including Palo Alto Networks PANW, CyberArk Software CYBR and Check Point Software CHKP. Shares of Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk Software have soared 17.1% and 9.1%, respectively, while Check Point Software stock has declined 3.4% during the same time frame.\n3-Month Price Return Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis outperformance has made investors wonder if this is the right time to buy or hold CRWD stock and wait for more stability. Here\u2019s why maintaining a hold strategy could be the most prudent move.\nResilience in CRWD\u2019s Financial Performance Post Outage\nCrowdStrike\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company\u2019s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.\nThe company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm\u2019s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.\nThis robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike\u2019s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company\u2019s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation\nCrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.\nThe Falcon platform\u2019s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike\u2019s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Market Position and Customer Loyalty\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm\u2019s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.\nMoreover, the company's \u201cFalcon Flex\u201d subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.\nNavigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike\nDespite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company\u2019s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management\u2019s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.\nAnalysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPotential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike\u2019s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern\nCrowdStrike\u2019s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry\u2019s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now\nWhile CrowdStrike\u2019s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company is scheduled to release its earnings on November 26, 2024. On that day, CrowdStrike Holdings is projected to report earnings of $0.82 per share, which would represent no growth from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $982.26 million, indicating a 24.97% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion. These totals would mark changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 32.89.\nWe can additionally observe that CRWD currently boasts a PEG ratio of 3.33. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.52.\nStory Continues\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nEarlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike\u2019s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn\u2019t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon\u2019s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.\nClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 6th on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.\nIs Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?\nOn November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.\nNow that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined\u00a0Catalysts\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.\nMcLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.\nMcLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to \u201cswitch course.\u201d\nOn the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined\u00a0Wealth!\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.\nDatta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.\nHe suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to \u201cpivot away\u201d from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.\nStory Continues\nAs the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

The company provides a range of security products including identity management, threat intelligence, and threat detection.\nThe company has 29,000 clients in multiple sectors, including healthcare, retail, technology, and the government. Its AI-native cybersecurity platform, Falcon, is its primary product that grew at 80% year-over-year in FQ2 2025. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has recently closed crucial partnerships, added innovations to its Falcon Platform, and expanded its CrowdStrike Marketplace to meet the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions.\nThe July 19 incident has left a bearing on the company. Despite that, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been resilient and showcased transparency and accountability to its customers. On August 29, Joseph Gallo from Jefferies appeared in an interview on Schwab Network to share his thesis on CRWD. He shares that CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has saved a lot of people in the security business and has the resources to continue doing so. Gallo emphasizes that despite the incident the product stands as a \u201csticky product\u201d and has taken an appropriate \u201cprudent\u201d cut to their revenue to ease their customers and investors alike.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their high price target of $540 represents an upside of 69% from current levels, as of November 7.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 10th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.\nIn the last 5 years CrowdStrike Holdings saw its revenue grow at 39% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Fortunately, the market has not missed this, and has pushed the share price up by 41% per year in that time. Despite the strong run, top performers like CrowdStrike Holdings have been known to go on winning for decades. On the face of it, this looks lke a good opportunity, although we note sentiment seems very positive already.\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Earnings and Revenue Growth November 9th 2024\nCrowdStrike Holdings is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's current watchlist.\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on stocks that could perform well regardless of who ends up running the White House. On Tuesday, Cramer observed that the day\u2019s market performance gave the impression that every stock could go higher no matter who secures the presidency.\nHe pointed to significant gains across various sectors, including aerospace, housing, retail, and healthcare. Cramer noted that this broad-based rally resulted in strong performances on Tuesday, with the Dow climbing 427 points, the S&P rising by 1.23%, and the NASDAQ soaring by 1.43%. However, he tempered his optimism by adding that days like Tuesday might prove to be outliers in the coming weeks.\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks\nCramer took the opportunity to highlight ten stocks he believes will thrive and said:\n\u201cI want to highlight ten stocks that I believe will do well under either candidate, a who\u2019s who of acclamation, companies that almost have to do well because of seismic trends and savvy managements. Companies that no White House would get hung up on, either because they\u2019re beneath notice or they\u2019re perceived as good corporate citizens by both sides. Stocks in industries that neither Trump nor Harris have ever targeted in the past.\u201d\nHe also raised an important question for the viewers: \u201cIf you had the results of the election in hand, would you really know what to buy or sell?\u201d According to Cramer, answering that question is far more complicated than it seems. He emphasized his list of stocks that can thrive regardless of the election outcome. These are companies that have no clear political adversaries in Washington, making them relatively safe bets. Cramer acknowledged, however, that many stocks that seem like obvious picks for one candidate or another often have hidden dynamics that don\u2019t get enough attention.\n\u201cIn the end, this presidential prognostication game is meaningless until we start hearing about cabinet appointments, those will tell us a lot. Then, we can figure out really who the winners and losers are. Right now, though, there are just too many political angles to every single stock story.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 5. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stock.\n\u201cHey, speaking of hating to lose the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, that's Desh Aurora, and the CEO of CrowdStrike, that's George Kurtz, are both extremely competitive. They know how to stop cybercrime better than anyone. I know it hurts our diversification efforts, but the Charitable Trust owns both these stocks because I'm a huge believer in cybersecurity and I'm not gonna be left behind by a great stock here. There's so much crime happening online. These companies literally can't handle all the business. Imagine that, I call that a high-quality problem.\u201d\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) offers cybersecurity solutions. It is known for its Falcon platform, a comprehensive suite of endpoint security solutions. Despite facing challenges earlier this year due to an outage that temporarily impacted its reputation, the company continues to be regarded as a top player in its field. During the fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings call, which ended on July 31, CEO George Kurtz acknowledged that the outage caused some prospective customers to delay signing contracts.\nHowever, he emphasized that most of these deals remain active in the sales pipeline, indicating that the company\u2019s position in the market is still strong. Its Falcon platform offers a wide range of security tools, with 28 modules available to customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, 65% of its customers were using at least five of these modules. The number of deals involving eight or more modules saw a significant increase, up 66% compared to the same period last year.\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) uses generative AI to detect threats and respond to potential breaches more rapidly. The company claims to have \"the industry's most complete AI-native defense,\" positioning its technology as highly advanced. Its AI models are trained on data from more than 2 trillion incidents every day, enabling them to continually improve in terms of both speed and accuracy. This sophisticated approach to threat detection is central to the company\u2019s value proposition and has helped maintain its reputation as a leader in endpoint security.\nOverall CRWD ranks 5th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks that can do well regardless of who wins.

Bosa notes that artificial intelligence could be \u201cless regulated\u201d and \u201cmore volatile\u201d under Trump's leadership. However, the president-elect\u2019s AI policy could be a boon to the industry itself, albeit at the expense of necessary guardrails for AI. Back in June, Republicans adopted a new party platform containing a provision related to scrapping Biden\u2019s executive orders on AI.\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss and\u00a015 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nBiden\u2019s executive orders sought to tackle new technology threats by requiring developers of powerful AI systems to share their safety test results with the US government and also called on federal agencies to develop guidelines for the responsible use of AI domains. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s allies have been proposing a different executive order that would launch a series of \u201cManhattan Projects\u201d for developing military technology and immediately review \u201cunnecessary and burdensome regulations\u201d to \u201cMake America Great in AI\u201d.\nTrump, however, seems to be only one of the few who thinks imposing guardrails on artificial intelligence could prove detrimental to the US. A poll shared with Time reveals that Americans across the political spectrum are skeptical about the idea that the U.S. should avoid regulating AI to outcompete China. According to a poll by the AI Policy Institute (AIPI), 75% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans believe that \u201ctaking a careful controlled approach\u201d to AI is preferable as opposed to \u201cmoving forward on AI as fast as possible to be the first country to get extremely powerful AI.\u201d\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAmid the ongoing debate, recent developments in AI are rapidly shaping the landscape in the backdrop. For instance, Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine, is said to be raising new investment that would value the search startup to a staggering $9 billion. The new funding round is set to raise $500 million led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which also holds a board seat in the startup.\nIn other news, OpenAI, an AI research lab and company, has acquired Chat.com, further adding to its collection of high-profile domain names. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the acquisition via email. While such AI-related news is often striking, AI capabilities continue to surprise even the most seasoned experts. In fact, AI can now even help you become a better parent. On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz's partner Justine Moore took to X to share an investment idea, advocating for \"a new wave of 'parenting co-pilots' powered by LLMs and agents. She highlighted companies such as Cradlewise, creators of an AI-driven baby monitor that tracks sleep patterns and rocks the crib, and Nanit, which utilizes AI to analyze crib footage and monitor a baby's breathing.\nStory Continues\n\u201cImagine an AI parenting companion that\u2019s always in your corner \u2013 ready to answer questions or talk about how you\u2019re feeling at any time of the day (or night)\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nData is at the forefront of many inventions today and is the primary ingredient of innovation. Of the many branches of data usage, predictive analytics is garnering immense traction, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistics, modeling, and machine learning to forecast, predict, and plan future events. There are different types of predictive analytics including regression analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics market was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023. The global predictive analytics market is expected to grow to $95.3 billion by 2032 from $18.02 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%. The report attributes the growth in the industry to the growing investments in data by the government and large corporations followed by IoT and AI integrations. The use of predictive analytics is bifurcated into multiple segments including life sciences, automotive, retail, energy, telecom, and healthcare, to name a few.\nStartups Disrupting the Predictive Analytics Space\nThere are a range of startups in the predictive analytics space that are revolutionizing the industry. One such name is Pecan AI. The automated predictive analytics platform is developed and designed intricately to meet the needs of data scientists. Data scientists can use the platform to build powerful predictive AI capabilities and machine learning models that drive business impact. Data scientists do not need coding or data science skills to make use of the platform. The platform is used by a range of companies including Johnson & Johnson, SciPlay, Hydrant, Kenvue, Proper Cloth, and DME Acquire. Earlier in January, the company introduced predictive generative AI to transform enterprises. Pecan AI also has partnerships with some of the largest tech corporations and platforms including Azure and AWS.\nDataRobot is another leader in the predictive analytics industry that delivers revolutionary AI use cases for businesses. Its AI platform consists of core AI features such as generative AI, predictive AI, AI governance, AI observability, and AI foundation. The platform promises 83% faster deployment and secures nearly 1.4 billion predictions every day. Users can run models in minutes by skipping manual data preparation and cleaning. Additionally, the platform eliminates the need for repetitive coding, by streamlining feature discovery and defining elements of datasets automatically. Users can connect data from warehouses such as AWS and Azure into a singular workspace. Some of the predictive use cases facilitated by DataRobot include time series modeling, clustering and seasonality, cold start forecasting, nowcasting, and anomaly detection.\nStory Continues\nNow that we have studied the predictive analytics industry and some revolutionary startups, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now we went through multiple reports on the internet, ETFs, and stock screeners. We then examined the analyst upside of each stock and ranked the ones with the highest percentage. Our list is in ascending order of the analyst upside as of November 11, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Predictive Analytics Stock to Invest in Now?\nA data analyst working at a computer, crunching numbers for the company's 80% total assets.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nAnalyst upside as of November 11, 2024: 12%\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) offers predictive analytics through its Automation Analytics and Intelligence platform. The platform offers workload automation solutions supported by a predictive analytics workload platform allowing entities to visualize data and manage complex workloads that facilitate the development of crucial business insights.\nSome key features of the platform by Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) include cross-platform visibility, dynamic service level management, enhanced workload analytics, business monitoring, enhanced change control, and dynamic critical path discovery. All these features combined put AVGO ahead of its competitors.\nOverall, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a rapidly growing company with expertise in ASICs, infrastructure software, and data analytics, contributing to its ranking on our list. Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their median price target of $200 implies an upside of 12%, as of November 11.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cWe continued to build our position in\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 8th on our list of best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain.\nWhile the stock has fallen 10% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.5% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 39% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 140.31.\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Earnings Per Share Growth November 16th 2024\nDive deeper into Broadcom's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Broadcom's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWhat About Dividends?\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Broadcom's TSR for the last 5 years was 507%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nA Different Perspective\nWe're pleased to report that Broadcom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 71% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 43%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.\nStory Continues\nOf course Broadcom may not be the best stock to buy.

          "whole_article": "The post-election rally of Wall Street after Donald Trump became President for the second term, has evaporated. As the initial euphoria of market participants is over, investors are assessing the pros and cons of Trump\u2019s economic policies, such as the imposition of tariffs, reduction of corporate taxes, deregulation of corporate America and their impact on inflation.\nThe technology sector is also concerned about Trump\u2019s tariffs on high-end chipsets, the future of the $52.5 billion Chips and Science Act and the imposition of antitrust regulations on big techs. Nevertheless, I believe that the AI frenzy will continue as this technology has become the need of the hour.\nAt this stage, we recommend five generative artificial intelligence (AI) behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank that have double-digit upside potential in the short term. These are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nAI Frenzy Remains Intact\nThe astonishing rally of U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative AI technology across the world was the prime factor.\nBloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending will increase from $67 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. UBS estimated that four U.S. technology giants that are member of the so-called \u201cmagnificent 7\u201d will spend around $267 billion as capital expenditure on AI applications in 2025, a jump of 33.5% year over year.\n5 AI Bigwigs to Buy With Double-Digit Short-Term Appreciation\nEach of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI (Gen AI) solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products. GOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance search results continue to boost traffic on GOOGL\u2019s search engine.\nStory Continues\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 17.6% from the last closing price of $175.58. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $185-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 36.7% and no downside.\nMeta Platforms Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Meta Platforms is set to receive initial shipments of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s (NVDA) new flagship AI chip later this year. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META is set to get B200 Blackwell chips.\nMETA\u2019s AI-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms. Management said that the company will invest $38-$40 billion as capital expenditure in AI initiatives in 2024. Moreover, capital spending is likely to reach more than $50 billion in 2025.\nOn July 24, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA\u2019s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbents like Open AI.\nStrong Price Upside Potential for META Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $577.16. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $475-$811. This indicates a maximum upside of 40.5% and a maximum downside of 17.7%.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\nZacks Rank #1 Taiwan Semiconductor is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world\u2019s best AI chipset developers. It has a strong clientele. The company is the largest manufacturer of NVIDIA\u2019s chipsets. NVIDIA is globally the largest developer of generative AI-based chips.\nTSM provides a range of wafer fabrication processes, including processes to manufacture complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, embedded memory, bipolar CMOS mixed-signal, and others.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is experiencing solid demand for its advanced technologies, such as 3-nanometer (nm) and 5nm. The growing adoption of its multi-project wafer processing service, which allows customers to reduce mask costs, is driving its customer momentum.\nTSM\u2019s growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus. Also, strength across its 7nm, 16nm and 28nm technologies are contributing well to its top-line growth.\nExcellent Price Upside Potential for TSM Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19.2% from the last closing price of $188.50. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $200-$250. This indicates a maximum upside of 32.6% and no downside.\nAdobe Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Adobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster.\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\nAttractive Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.4% from the last closing price of $529.87. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703. This indicates a maximum upside of 32.7% and a maximum downside of 17%.\nBroadcom Inc.\nBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers. AVGO\u2019s solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers.\nThe acquisition of VMware has benefited the infrastructure software solutions of Broadcom. VMware\u2019s expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy. AVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\nSolid Price Upside Potential for AVGO Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 12.5% from the last closing price of $170.38. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $150-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 40.9% and a maximum downside of 12%.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Headlines Making Waves Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves.\nAccording to the \"Hyperscale Data Centers - Global Strategic Business Report\", the global market for hyperscale data centers is estimated to reach US$730.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 23.1% from 2023 to 2030. From the increasing adoption of cloud services to the rise of big data and artificial intelligence, several factors are at play when it comes to its rapid growth. As per the report, the biggest driver is cloud computing, with more and more companies migrating their workloads to the cloud to reduce costs, improve scalability, and enhance flexibility.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\u00a0and\u00a08 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now\nThese hyperscalers need a lot of energy to run their data centers around the clock. According to McKinsey & Company, data center power needs are expected to grow three times higher than the current capacity by the end of the decade, from between 3 and 4 percent of total US power demand today to between 11 and 12 percent in 2030. Naturally, the power sector has become a significant AI player. Several technology companies are looking at nuclear power, including the use of small modular reactors (SMR), to meet their electricity needs.\n\u201cDriven by recent trends in AI development, projected power consumption by data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase in the range from 8% to 17% by 2030\u2014or potentially even higher, as progress in AI technologies is not linear but exponential, as seen in Silicon Valley today\u201d.\nRecent AI News\nAs the demand for advanced computing power grows, the latest AI breakthroughs are reshaping industries and driving innovation at an unprecedented pace. Then again, nothing is perfect. A few days back, OpenAI\u2019s premier chatbot, ChatGPT, went down for a total of 30 minutes. According to an outage tracking website Downdetector, over 19,000 people were impacted due to the chatbot\u2019s unavailability. Sam Altman, the CEO, admitted to the outage on X and apologized.\nThe same company is said to be hitting stumbling blocks recently. That\u2019s because, according to Bloomberg, its latest model Orion hasn\u2019t been performing as well as the developers had hoped for. OpenAI, however, isn\u2019t the only company seemingly facing a plateau. Three leading AI companies are now seeing diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build newer models.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, search habits are changing across the globe now that artificial intelligence is here. According to research from Yext, a digital presence platform for multi-location brands, 45% of customers are likely to use and trust an AI tool for finding more information about a brand, while 51% now use social media, and 28% turn to voice assistants.\n\u201cGoogle impressions have dropped 8-20% in the past two years, pushing marketers to adapt as search behaviour shifts with AI-driven overviews, chatbots and social media searches. Instagram and TikTok have become favoured alternative search engines, particularly for younger consumers\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nMarket Capitalization: $823.05 billion\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. It designs chips for companies that are building AI data centers.\nOn November 12, Citi analyst Christopher Danely noted that recent earnings saw semiconductor consensus estimates dropping by 11% while the SOX index, which measures semiconductor stocks, fell by 9%. The declines largely come from Microchip, NXP Semiconductors, and Intel; but the firm believes that the selloff is \u201calmost over and attention will shift to 2025\u201d. Citi further states that industrial market struggles will end sometime in the first half of 2025. Since 75% of semiconductor demand looks solid, investors should start investing more in them going into Q1. One of its Buy-rated names is Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). Broadcom has also been deemed an important stock by Jefferies analysts, who expect outperformance from it later in 2025.\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that should not be ignored.\nArtificial Intelligence is driving an unprecedented expansion in the potential market size for hardware and software products. According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the \u201cCNBC Connect\u201d event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI\u2019s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology.\n\u201cThree years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you\u201d.\nREAD ALSO: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 8 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now\nLatest Developments in AI\nLet\u2019s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported.\nIn other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation\u2019s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC\u2019s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation.\nStory Continues\nSpeaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training\u2014the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures\u2014have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring \u201ctest-time compute,\u201d a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called \u201cinference\u201d phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia\u2019s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nMarket Capitalization: $835.61 billion\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. It designs chips for companies that are building AI data centers.\nOn November 7, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis reaffirmed his \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), citing surging demand for AI chips that will last \u201cseveral years\u201d to benefit the technology company. According to Curtis, the AI accelerator market will grow by 58% a year from $47 billion in 2023 to $287 billion in 2027. Moreover, there isn\u2019t a sign of a CapEx spending slowdown from the major technology companies as well. While Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s chip business is largely driven by Google, other companies are also likely to use it in a significant manner in the years to come.\n\u201cWe see the most near-term upside at Marvell and Nvidia, but do expect outperformance from Broadcom later in 2025\u201d.\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks that should not be ignored. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.29%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.86%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.09%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 1.87% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.3% in that time.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Broadcom Inc. will be of great interest to investors.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 69.19%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology powerhouse known for its expertise in semiconductor design, development, and supply, alongside its enterprise software and security solutions. The company\u2019s cybersecurity portfolio includes a range of products, such as its Symantec Enterprise Cloud platform, as well as solutions for payment, mainframe, network, endpoint, and identity security.\nIn the third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, marking a 47% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and solid non-AI semiconductor performance. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects its AI revenue to rise 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the total for the year to $12 billion, primarily fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOn November 5, BofA reaffirmed its Buy rating on AVGO, citing the company's leadership in AI computing and networking, along with its strong free cash flow. However, the bank lowered its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast due to seasonal challenges, particularly stemming from a product transition with Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) that is expected to affect revenue in the first half of the year. Still, Broadcom\u2019s position is expected to be buoyed by new AI and networking contracts, along with further opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to adjusted earnings per share of $7.31 by 2026. As AI adoption continues to grow, Broadcom\u2019s focus on high-performance AI networking solutions, especially in complement to NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell architecture, could potentially strengthen its future prospects.\nOverall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of UBS\u2019 Top Quant Stocks In AI, IT, Healthcare & Other Sectors: Top 33 Stocks In All Sectors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other UBS\u2019 top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors.\nWith the third quarter of the 2024 earnings season underway, Wall Street is dealing with a changing stock market environment. The Federal Reserve has started its interest rate reduction cycle and market watchers are on the lookout for labor market and inflationary indicators to determine whether the Fed will be able to meet its goal of reducing interest rates by an additional 50 basis points by the end of this year.\nSimultaneously, the shifting economic climate is also creating changes in the investment environment. High interest rates traditionally do not mean well for certain stock market sectors barring exceptional circumstances. Some sectors that don\u2019t perform well in a high-rate environment include real estate, healthcare, and technology.\nFor two of these, this has been the case in the 2022 \u2013 2024 Federal Reserve interest rate hiking cycle as well. Starting from real estate, the flagship S&P index\u2019s real estate sector\u2019s annualized three-year return is currently -2.66%. From its peak of 324.75 in December 2021, the index has lost 48.2 points or 14.8%. Similarly, the high-end healthcare and biotechnology sector does not fare well during high interest rates either. Since 2021\u2019s close, the S&P\u2019s pharmaceutical stock index is down by -0.84% while the S&P\u2019s biotechnology index has lost a sizable 12.61%.\nThis brings us to our third stock market sector, a.k.a, technology. Technology, as you\u2019re likely aware, has seen a lot of investor interest due to the surge in artificial intelligence. Looking at the performance of the S&P\u2019s technology stock index, its performance also mirrors real estate and healthcare stocks before the frenzy around artificial intelligence started. Between 2021\u2019s close and the market\u2019s bottom in October 2022, the index had lost 33%. During the same time period, the real estate, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology stock indexes had lost 34.8%, 12.2%, and 30.5%, respectively. However, market optimism surrounding artificial intelligence has created a clear bifurcation in performance.\nAs an example, while real estate stocks have gained 29% since the October 2022 bottom and biotechnology stocks have added 25% in value, information technology stocks are up by a whopping 115%. This shows that tech stocks have delivered 4x the returns of both real estate and biotechnology. Driving this is artificial intelligence, with the shares of the world\u2019s premier AI GPU designer up by\u00a0690%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nStory Continues\nLooking at these shifts, the next question to ask is which stock market sectors might benefit from the evolving environment moving forward. On this front, investment bank UBS has some insights. In its Equity Compass Report issued in mid-October, the bank identifies key themes and trends for US and global stock markets. Within global and US stock market sectors, the bank has rated only one sector as \u2018Most Attractive\u2019. Unsurprisingly, this is the US technology sector which is currently experiencing a sustained surge of investor optimism courtesy of artificial intelligence.\nThe bank shares several data points to justify its optimism in the US technology sector, and more specifically, artificial intelligence companies. Citing data from the Hugging Face repository, a collection of software development tools, it reveals \u201can average 200% y/y rise for new AI models and model downloads combined so far in 2024.\u201d UBS is also optimistic about the growing adoption of artificial intelligence in the US business world. AI adoption is key since big technology firms that have invested billions of dollars in AI need it to generate returns on their investment.\nAs per UBS, data from the Census Bureau\u2019s Business Trends and Outlook (BTOS) survey released in September 2024 shows that AI adoption across the 1.2 million firms tracked was picking up the pace. \u201cIn the survey, 5.9% of companies reported using AI as of 3Q24, up from 3.7% in 3Q23,\u201d outlined the bank in its report. Not only did 5.9% of the firms adopt AI, but the survey\u2019s outlook for the next six months revealed that AI adoption across the surveyed population could rise by 2.8 percentage points to sit at 8.7%. Commenting on the implications of the higher adoption, UBS stated that \u201cincreasing future adoption will increase visibility on AI monetization, which is consistent with recent comments from leading cloud platforms.\u201d The firms slated to benefit the most from this monetization are those \u201d with strong footprints in existing customer bases,\u201d believes the bank.\nThese statements necessitate asking the question of\u00a0which\u00a0industries are slated to benefit the most from AI adoption. Fortunately for us, UBS also shares data for the industries currently leading the way with AI adoption and those that could grow adoption in the future. Right now, the information technology and personal services sectors are leading with AI adoption since as of September 2024, their respective adoption percentages were 19.1% and 14.7%. For the next six months, while the same industries are expected to lead the pack in overall AI adoption through their 23% and 19.8% percentages, others are expected to make higher percentage point gains. Two industries that stand out in the report are educational services and the finance and insurance industries.\nAs per the report, the former is expected to increase its AI adoption by 5.6 percentage points to 18.7% over the next six months from the current value of 13.1%. For the finance and insurance sector, it is expected to mark a 6.2 percentage point jump to 13.4% from the existing AI adoption of 7.2%. Of course, while AI is by far the most popular sector in the market right now, UBS also shares other attractive areas. It outlines that the market \u201calso offers exposure to secular growth in longevity through various US medical device companies. Many US companies are also playing leading roles in the energy transition via electric vehicles, renewables, and energy efficiency.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of UBS stocks with improving quantitative indicators, we chose the firm\u2019s top stocks that are seeing improvements in EPS growth, P/E ratio, and other indicators. Stocks within each sector were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. The sectors themselves were ranked by the cumulative number of funds invested in the firms.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc (AVGO): AI Growth with Custom Chips and VMWare Boost\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 130\nSector: Information Technology\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. The firm operates in the hardware and software industries. Its key strengths lie on the former front, with Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) responsible for providing networking and custom chips for a wide variety of use cases. These provide the firm with large customers like Apple and have enabled it to establish a foothold in the AI industry. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) benefits from AI through its custom chips, and word on the street is that the firm has partnered up with OpenAI to develop a custom chip. Yet, reliance on customers like Apple is a double-edged sword as it also exposes Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to revenue losses in case its customers decide to develop custom chips. On the software front, the firm\u2019s VMWare acquisition has enabled it to sizably grow its revenue and could lead to further tailwinds in the future.\nBaron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cBroadcom Inc.\u00a0is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom\u2019s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, \u201cthere is only one Broadcom. Period.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of UBS\u2019 top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia\u2019s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.\nThis partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.\nFor the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%.

Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock\u2019s ongoing upward momentum.\nAbout the Company\nToast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.\nWith its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.\nIts platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.\nToast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of \u201cA\u201d in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a \u201cF\u201d in Value.\nQ3 Earnings Beat\nOn November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.\nQ3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.\nThe company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.\nGross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.\nManagement comments were overwhelmingly bullish:\n\u201cToast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.\u201d\nEstimates Headed Higher\nAnalysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.\nStory Continues\nFor the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.\nFor the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.\nFor the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.\nToast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote\nWith the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.\nJPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.\nThe Technical Take\nThe stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO\u2019d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.\nAfter trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.\nWith the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.\nPost earnings low: $36\nGap fill: $33\n21-day: $32\n50-day: $29.20\n200-day: $25.20\nFibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32\nWhile that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.\nIn Summary\nToast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.\nThe company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.\nAs Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.\nBear of the Day:\nClean Harbors \u00a0is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.\nThe company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?\nWith an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.\nAbout the Company\nClean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).\nThe company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world\u2019s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.\nCLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cD\u201d in Value, But \u201cB\u201d in both Momentum and Growth.\nQ3 Earnings\nThe company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.\nDespite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.\nPositive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.\nWhile there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.\nEarnings Estimates\nEstimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.\nFor the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.\nLooking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.\nFor the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year\u2019s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.\nTechnical Take\nThe drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.\nThis volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.\nThe drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.\nThe stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.\nIn Summary\nClean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.\nWith significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.\nAdditional content:\nServiceNow Expands Generative AI Offerings: Is the Stock a Buy?\nServiceNow\u00a0is adding Generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to the Now platform to foster responsible AI.

The free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, subscription revenues are projected between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 21.5-22% on a GAAP basis.

Quote\nThe consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.\nStrong Portfolio Aids NOW\u2019s Prospects\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.\nServiceNow\u2019s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.\nThe Xanadu update adds the latest AI capabilities to boost customer agility, enhance productivity and improve employee experiences.

ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nNOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.\nThe strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.\nIn third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.\nNOW\u2019s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation\nHowever, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector\u2019s 6.37X.\nWe believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow\u2019s premium valuation.\nConclusion\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.\nServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) Elevates Now Platform with Enhanced AI Governance and GenAI Solutions\nA technician connecting an EV battery to the Grid Integrated Vehicle platform.\nServiceNow, Inc.

          "whole_article": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in NOW?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.\nInsiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nNYSE:NOW Insider Trading Volume November 14th 2024\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of ServiceNow\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?\nInsiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nMarket Capitalization: $215.95 billion\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps digitize and unify organizations so that they can find smarter, faster, better ways to make work flow.\nOn November 12, Wells Fargo raised the firm\u2019s price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $1,150 from $1,050 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares. According to the firm, ServiceNow is among the few companies that are demonstrating tangible AI monetization, i.e. they are really making money from AI. One of the key catalysts that will drive this momentum forward is the launch of its CSM/ITSM agents in Xanadu on November 24. The launch is a major step for the company in enhancing its AI-led customer service offerings. Finally, Wells Fargo expects ServiceNow to take the lead in AI customer service.\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?\u201d\nCramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.\n\u201cTrump wants to cut taxes\u2014all taxes\u2014including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It\u2019s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that\u2019s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.\u201d\nCramer said the market is still \u201coversold\u201d as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow Customer Service Management and Five9 Intelligent CX Platform to streamline self-service and assisted service operations\nIntegrated solution to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction\nTORONTO & BARCELONA, Spain, November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow World Forum & Five9 CX Summit\u2014ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, and Five9 (NASDAQ: FIVN), provider of the Intelligent CX Platform, today announced an expanded partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified end-to-end employee and customer experiences. By combining the strengths of ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) and the Five9 platform, the solution will create more streamlined self-service and assisted service operations and unify customer support processes to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and simplify contact center operations.\n\"Organizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together,\" said John Ball, senior vice president, Customer and Industry Workflows at ServiceNow. \"ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self-service and assisted service across voice and digital channels. Our expanded partnership with Five9 takes this even further, combining the best of both platforms to streamline and unify contact center operations with a turnkey solution that\u2019s fast to deploy and delivers fast ROI.\"\n\"Five9\u2019s longstanding partnership with ServiceNow has been rooted in the joint mission to create seamless and powerful end-to-end customer experiences,\" said Callan Schebella, executive vice president, product management, Five9. \"This next phase of our partnership transforms the approach to customer experience management, alleviating a lot of the frustrations that come with using multiple systems to address customer needs. We\u2019ve taken a big step forward to empower customers with our joint AI capabilities and improved interface functionality, easing the day-to-day challenges of customer-facing service.\"\n\"Combining the most valuable features into a unified interface can transform the way we support our customers,\" said Bob Massengill, senior director, Technology Infrastructure, Pilot Travel Centers, LLC. \"This new ServiceNow-Five9 joint solution has the potential to enable us to address customer needs more quickly and effectively.\"\nStory Continues\nThe new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.\nReal-time Transcription \u2013 Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents\u2019 work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.\nUnified Routing \u2013 Five9\u2019s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9. This reduces operational overhead for managers through streamlined routing management across both systems, making it easier to adjust staffing during high-demand periods. It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.\nSingle Agent Experience \u2013 Native Call Controls within ServiceNow\u2019s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer\u2019s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.\nAvailability\nThe ServiceNow and Five9 integrated capabilities are expected to be available to select customers in the first half of 2025.\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people. We move with the pace of innovation to help customers transform organizations across every industry while upholding a trustworthy, human centered approach to deploying our products and services at scale.

With this launch, ServiceNow is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio for customers. This includes new, expanded Now Assist capabilities that drive greater visibility and controls with an AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices. Native multilingual support in Now Assist extends GenAI\u2019s global footprint for seamless, culturally aware communications and translations. Finally, purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety.\nAs enterprises have accelerated the adoption of GenAI, they are discovering that siloed applications and scattered data are barriers to impact and that establishing clearly defined, human-centric governance processes are essential to the effective use and oversight of GenAI. That\u2019s why ServiceNow delivers a winning combination of one platform with an integrated data layer and continues to optimize its AI platform for speed, scale, and security. The single architecture of the Now Platform helps ensure strong governance is embedded in its Now Assist GenAI solutions, models, and agents no matter where they are deployed in an organization.\n\"Enterprises across every industry are embracing a future of greater autonomy and productivity, all in service to their employees, customers, and overall business impact,\" said Jon Sigler, senior vice president of Platform and AI at ServiceNow. \"The ServiceNow platform was built to empower this transformation, offering smarter, faster ways of working through AI-enabled automation. With governance at the core, these new innovations bring more personalized, collaborative, trusted experiences to life across the enterprise.\"\nElevating customer trust with integrated AI governance\nTeams working with AI are often burdened with siloed tools and systems, making visibility and AI governance difficult. AI governance requires the integration of complex business processes and needs a best-of-breed workflow platform to be implemented successfully. With a unified AI inventory data model for connecting AI strategy, technology, security, and compliance to operate as an AI control tower, and expanded oversight for AI Governance for Now Assist, ServiceNow is laying a foundation to help customers build trust while accelerating business transformation.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also introduced new Now Assist capabilities that empower customers with the tools needed for responsible AI use:\nNow Assist Guardian provides built-in monitoring and responsible AI guardrails so customers can better control the use of GenAI on the Now Platform. This includes the management and mitigation of offensive content, security vulnerabilities, and the exposure of sensitive information.\nNow Assist Data Kit eases the often-cumbersome task of managing and consuming data for AI use cases. Users can create and easily manage datasets for AI skills and applications, develop ground truth datasets to benchmark for accuracy and help predict AI outcomes, and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of experiences built with Now Assist Skill Kit.\nNow Assist Analytics offers greater visibility into the adoption, usage, and performance of Now Assist across the enterprise. With these insights, customers can make more informed, data-driven decisions to advance GenAI adoption, evaluate ROI on GenAI investments, and enable better business outcomes.\nExtending the value and impact of GenAI globally\nWith today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow is adding new built-in multilingual features to Now Assist. These new features address customer demand and expand the application of ServiceNow\u2019s GenAI solutions in global markets. Now Assist can now generate, summarize, and respond to GenAI prompts in the user\u2019s native language, providing improved, culturally aware understanding and communication for both agents and requestors.\nThe following languages are supported natively by Now Assist: English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese. Other languages will continue to be supported with ServiceNow\u2019s existing Dynamic Translation, which automatically translates user inputs and a response back in the user\u2019s language.\nAccelerating productivity with tailored Now Assist solutions\nBuilding on the Xanadu platform release\u2014which marked the company\u2019s most comprehensive set of AI innovations to date\u2014ServiceNow has further expanded Now Assist solutions, purpose-built for specific enterprise use cases. From configuration management to legal affairs and health and safety, GenAI can help transform the productivity and efficacy of these critical internal functions.\nNow Assist for Configuration Management Database (CMDB) uses AI to make managing and understanding data easier for customers. It helps users keep a clean and accurate CMDB by reducing duplicate data, simplifying complex information, and streamlining data input. With Now Assist for CMDB, users can quickly view summaries of Configuration Items (CIs) and their dependencies, and AI can find and fix duplicate data automatically. It also assists in the setup of Service Graph Connectors to bring data into the CMDB and fix any issues that come up during the process.\nNow Assist for Legal Service Delivery helps legal teams deliver faster service to clients with auto-generated summaries of legal requests and matters. Legal teams are often juggling multiple requests and complex legal matters, such as investigations, simultaneously. With Now Assist, they can fulfill these requests with greater efficiency and faster time to resolution.\nNow Assist in Contract Management streamlines contract processing and reduces risk by leveraging GenAI to automatically flag non-standard language, identify missing clauses and suggest revisions within contracts such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Additionally, GenAI provides rapid insights into contractual terms and obligations by intelligently extracting metadata from contracts. This helps reduce cost, revenue leakage, and risk for the enterprise.\nNow Assist for Health and Safety helps ensure a safer environment for employees by streamlining incident management processes while reducing manual, repetitive work for health and safety workers. It uses GenAI to auto-generate summaries of safety incidents and lessons learned based on incident records, resulting in more effective communication, improved agent productivity, and proactive prevention and resolution of incidents.\nIn addition to these new innovations, ServiceNow Impact\u2014the ServiceNow customer success solution to maximize AI, optimize performance, provide on-demand expertise, and accelerate business value\u2014includes new GenAI accelerators to help make adoption of Now Assist solutions easier and faster for customers.\n\"Worldwide spending on AI is projected to grow 3 times greater than the five-year CAGR for worldwide IT spending over the same period (2023-2028), driven by the rapid infusion of AI and GenAI for employee experience, customer engagement, business processes, and industry innovation,\" said Ritu Jyoti, general manager/group VP, AI, and Data market research and advisory at IDC. \"As organizations look to drive value from AI transformations, they recognize the need for a single and scalable platform that connects people, processes, data, and systems. ServiceNow is meeting customers where they are by streamlining workflows and simplifying complex processes on a single AI-powered platform. As ServiceNow expands GenAI into new areas of the enterprise, the company continues to help organizations transform operations and stay competitive.\"\nCustomers like EY are already seeing the benefits of Now Assist.\n\"GenAI is having a huge impact on our organization, both in the way EY teams deliver EY services and support EY people, but also in creating opportunities to go to market with ServiceNow to help EY clients transform their businesses,\" said Hank Prybylski, Global Vice Chair, Transformation, EY. \"We are seeing incredible value in the Now Assist space and looking to extend that to a whole suite of areas including customer service management and more broadly to our managed services environment.\"\nPutting data and AI to work across the Now Platform\nOn top of today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow recently announced Workflow Data Fabric, a breakthrough innovation that enhances all ServiceNow workflows, AI solutions, and AI Agents.\nThis enhanced, integrated data layer allows customers to connect, understand, and act on structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data across the enterprise, inside and outside of ServiceNow. Coupled with zero copy capabilities and the future integration of Knowledge Graph, which transforms raw data into contextual insights, ServiceNow is unifying people, processes, operations, and systems so AI can work more autonomously across the enterprise.\nThese data capabilities are an instrumental part of ServiceNow's vision of AI Agents that work autonomously and collaboratively with people to enable business transformation. This vision also includes the expansion of its partnership with NVIDIA to jointly develop AI agent use cases on the Now Platform and accelerate the adoption of Agentic AI, reinventing how AI delivers value across all industries.\nAvailability\nAI Governance for Now Assist is available today to a limited set of customers and is expected to be generally available in Q1 2025. All other new GenAI innovations announced today are now generally available to customers in the ServiceNow Store.\nAdditional Information\nLearn more about ServiceNow Now Assist here.\nRead about additional news from ServiceNow today:\nNew innovations enhance developer productivity, industry momentum\nServiceNow and Five9 expand partnership to deliver unified, end-to-end agent and customer experiences\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

Businesses use ServiceNow's AI-backed products to automate and manage their IT processes and reduce costs.\nLast month, ServiceNow unveiled a fourth-quarter subscription revenue forecast that topped Wall Street expectations.\nThe firm, which has been rolling out new AI-enhanced offerings to its enterprise clients such as ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and video conferencing service Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), also increased its full-year subscription revenue outlook thanks to solid demand from new and existing customers.\nMeanwhile, ServiceNow's rival Salesforce has yet to show enough evidence its own AI offering will be enough to return growth to double-digits in the near term, the Wells Fargo analysts said.\nIn August, the software-as-a-service pioneer reported better-than-anticipated revenue of $9.33 billion in its second quarter and raised its annual profit outlook to a range of $10.03 to $10.11 per share, up from $9.86 to $9.94. But Salesforce's guidance for third-quarter revenue still missed expectations, exacerbating worries around a potential rebound in cloud spending.\nThe Wells Fargo analysts said they see more \"attractive opportunities\" in companies like ServiceNow that have already shown an ability to make money off of so-called generative AI. The setup for Salesforce heading into next is \"tough,\" they added.\nRelated Articles\nCloud software groups recovering heading into the end of 2024, Wells Fargo says\nNovavax cuts 2024 revenue forecast again on lower COVID vaccine sales\nTyson Foods beats quarterly results on strong demand for beef, pork\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nServiceNow (NOW) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 6.7%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\nTechnology is a Big Deal, Strategist Highlights\nThe Magnificent Seven continues to grasp a sizeable market share of the market gains over the past few years. That said, investors and analysts are excited to see what this earnings period has to offer for the magnificent seven and how much of an influence they have on the market. On October 31, Christian Dery, head of macro strategy at Capital Fund Management, appeared in an interview\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the impact of the magnificent seven on the market.\nDery suggested that these companies have grown to become large entities and their market capitalization often fluctuates by $2 billion to $400 billion on earnings events. Looking at the dispersion of the index, Dery adds that individual stocks within the S&P are very diverse and more independent, hinting towards a very low correlation in the index.\nHe adds that generative AI and LLMs are very different from the traditional software business. Therefore, the hyperscaling model that is conventionally taken from software can not be applied here. For every new customer in the software business, the marginal cost often goes down to nearly zero. However, if you look at the \u201ctech incumbents\u201d, they have to increase their capital expenditures to develop compute clusters and scale their operations, suggests Dery.\nIn 2023, the chips industry generated revenue of about $3 billion, reflecting that we are yet to find a killer use case or see results of generous AI spending. Dery adds that the market is more likely to be \u201cdiscerning\u201d on the path to profitability since companies are going to focus more on capital expenditures and projections for capital expenditures. He is particularly interested in the CapEx projections of the Magnificent Seven and shares that if they miss there could be a negative reaction among those stocks.\nDery reiterated that the market is yet to see the investments pay off multiple times but maintains his interest in capital expenditures by these companies playing out. While he is bullish on technological innovation and believes artificial intelligence is disruptive and a \u201cbig deal\u201d, he fails to see viable results as of now. Dery also emphasizes that these companies are directing their investments to AI because they do not want to fall behind competitors, with no proper timeline for AI monetization.\nStory Continues\nThat said, some companies are investing heavily in innovation and are at the forefront of a technological revolution.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we went over multiple similar rankings on the internet from credible financial websites. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NOW)'s AI Innovations Drive Revenue Growth and Strategic Partnerships\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software company that helps companies manage digital workflows and operations using its cloud computing platform.

(NYSE:NOW) generated $2.79 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from the same quarter in 2023. Of this, subscription revenue was worth $2.72 billion, representing a growth rate of 23%. The company attributes this momentum to customers doubling down on ServiceNow as a leading AI platform for operational efficacy and business transformation. The company itself is confident in its future performance as the demand for AI continues to grow.\nDuring the quarter, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) processed its largest AI release to date, the Now Platform Xanadu release. The release encompasses hundreds of new and improved AI capabilities and generative AI solutions for the telecom, media, technology, and financial services industries. In addition to that, the company also partnered with NVIDIA to co-develop AI agents using Nvidia\u2019s blueprints in the ServiceNow platform. To align with its expansion strategy, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) also forged separate partnerships with Siemens, Rimini Street, and Pearson to develop AI use cases for different industries and customer segments.\nOverall, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an investor favorite because of its quality deals with major players in the industry. Similarly, the company has high growth expectations for the full fiscal year and the fourth quarter of 2024, contributing to its ranking as one of the best innovative stocks according to hedge funds.\nIthaka Group\u2019\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFounded in 2004,\u00a0ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW) has become the leading provider of cloud-based software solutions that define, structure, manage and automate workflow services for global enterprises. ServiceNow pioneered the use of the cloud to deliver IT service management (\u201cITSM\u201d) applications. These applications allow users to manage incidents and to plan new IT projects, provision clouds, manage application performance and build applications themselves. The company has since expanded beyond the ITSM market to provide workflow solutions for IT operations management, customer support, human resources, security operations and other enterprise departments where a patchwork of semi-automated processes have been used with varying success in the past. ServiceNow\u2019s stock appreciated in the quarter on the back of strong earnings that beat Street estimates on the top and bottom line, with the company pointing to strength in subscription revenues, cRPO, operating margins, and continued demand for the company\u2019s AI products.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
