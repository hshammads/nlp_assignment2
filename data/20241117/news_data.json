Those are both good for businesses across the board.\u201d\nKrishna believes a lighter regulatory environment will prompt clients to make investment decisions more quickly and also lay the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n\u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna added.\nIBM CEO Arvind Krishna (left) with Yahoo Finance anchor Seana Smith (right) at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Nov. 12, 2024.\nA shift toward less regulation would be a dramatic change for the industry, which has faced intense scrutiny from the Biden administration. Under FTC Chair Lina Khan\u2019s leadership, regulators aggressively pursued cases against the industry\u2019s biggest companies, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\nTrump, on the other hand, has promised to cut excess red tape, including his promise to throw out Biden\u2019s executive order aimed at putting safety guardrails on AI \u2014 a move that would be viewed as controversial by those within the industry.\nWhile Trump\u2019s antitrust agendas remain uncertain, there seems to be growing optimism that he'll employ a more hands-off approach compared to Biden.\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to rally further into year-end as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump with Khan/FTC days in the rear view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCisco (CSCO) CFO Scott Herren is confident in the company\u2019s momentum heading into 2025. He told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts that he feels \u201creally good\u201d about Cisco\u2019s position, noting \u201cstrength across the board.\u201d\n\u201cIt's hard to predict what's going to happen from a political standpoint, but when you look at the things that are going to drive government efficiency, we've got the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that's about increasing productivity, and technology is always going to be critical to increasing productivity,\u201d Herren said.\nDespite optimism from tech leaders, investor sentiment seems a bit more cautious. Performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks, outside of Tesla (TSLA), has been lackluster since Election Day, hampered by risks associated with a stronger dollar and more tariffs.\nStory Continues\nCheck out what top decision-makers said at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference:\nBillionaire Tom Steyer: Trump presidency won\u2019t hold back the energy transition\nAnduril CEO sees opportunity for defense tech startups under Trump\nHow Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could affect the cost of jeans, appliances, and everyday items\nThat could change quickly, Defiance ETFs CEO Sylvia Jablonski told me. AI, which has \u201cessentially been all the rage\u201d on Wall Street, remains in its \u201cinfancy,\u201d with vast growth potential ahead, he said.\nAnd IBM\u2019s Krishna echoed this sentiment, citing AI as a key catalyst not only for IBM\u2019s stock but the US tech sector overall.\n\u201cAI spending from our clients is going to increase ... And automation spending is going to go up \u2026 I think that there is going to be more of an appetite for US technology globally,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot more appetite to go invest in US technology from all over the globe.\u201d\nSince the start of the year, IBM shares have climbed more than 25%, outpacing the Nasdaq 100's (^NDX) 20% jump.\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

This section of the AI Act, which became law earlier this year, specifically addresses general-purpose AI model providers, setting out standards and practices they must follow to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. Some of the AI models that will be impacted by regulations drafted as discussions on this draft progress include GPT models by OpenAI and Claude by Anthropic, among others.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nMeanwhile, London-based AI startup Tessl recently raised more than $125 million in a funding round led by prominent venture capital firms like Index Ventures, Accel, GV, and Boldstart. According to a report by TechCrunch, this has pushed the valuation of the startup to more than $500 million. The startup is building an AI native platform that developers and their teams can use to create and maintain software. The firm is still developing the product and plans to launch it in the open market by sometime next year.

A new report by management consulting firm Gartner sheds expert light on the matter, AI and GenAI are driving rapid increases in electricity consumption, with data center forecasts over the next two years reaching as high as 160% growth. Gartner claims that 40% of existing AI data centers will be operationally constrained by power availability by 2027. Research from the company indicates that the power required for data centers to run incremental AI-optimized servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year in 2027, which is 2.6 times the level in 2023.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nBob Johnson, VP Analyst at Gartner, has said that the explosive growth of new hyperscale data centers to implement GenAI is creating an insatiable demand for power that will exceed the ability of utility providers to expand their capacity fast enough. In turn, per Johnson, this threatens to disrupt energy availability and lead to shortages, which will limit the growth of new data centers for GenAI and other uses from 2026. He added that short-term power shortages are likely to continue for years as new power transmission, distribution and generation capacity could take years to come online and won\u2019t alleviate current problems.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nWhat is the Metaverse?\nAccording to McKinsey & Company, the metaverse is the emerging 3-D-enabled digital space that uses virtual reality, augmented reality, and other advanced internet and semiconductor technology to allow people to have lifelike experiences online.\nThe basic features of the metaverse include a sense of immersion, real-time interactivity, and user agency. Whereas, the full vision of the metaverse encompasses platforms and devices that work seamlessly with each other, the possibility for thousands of people to interact simultaneously, and use cases well beyond gaming. While the phenomenon gained attention in 2021 with internet searches for the term increasing by 7,200%, it seems here to stay. With lockdowns and work-from-home policies in place, the interest in shared virtual environments spiked. The opportunity remains vast with metaverse having the potential to generate up to $5 trillion in value by 2030.\nIs the Metaverse Still Alive?\nWhen the tech guru Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook\u2019s name to Meta in 2021, he clearly drove the metaverse narrative in the world. Although the vision of a digital future of work and recreation became a buzz for a while, other emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence decided to dominate the headlines later.\nQuestions regarding whether Zuckerberg should have transformed a successful social media company into a VR venture have also been asked. In September 2023, BBC reported that his company\u2019s virtual and augmented reality branch, Reality Labs, has lost $21 billion since the prior year. The firm later introduced its social virtual reality space Horizon Worlds. While some users have complained about not having enough people to make it fun, the platform\u2019s monthly users can simply not match the number of people who consume social media like Facebook and Instagram every day.\nAlthough the company\u2019s virtual reality headset and its Horizon Worlds have not gone mainstream after 3 years of the company\u2019s founding, experts argue that the metaverse is still as relevant as ever. On October 2, CNBC reported that Zuckerberg\u2019s metaverse is finally showing signs of life as his company might have found its footing in VR and AR through a different medium, smart glasses. After the firm witnessed early success in the market for smart glasses via a partnership with Ray-Ban, the CEO unveiled the first \u201cfully-functioning\u201d prototype AR glasses, Orion, in September.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe right way to look at Orion is as a time machine. These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\u201d\nAlthough there might be a lack of connection between the metaverse which was the next big thing two years ago and the prevailing tech landscape dominated by AI, some argue that the reports of the metaverse\u2019s death are \u2018exaggerated\u2019 and that it is a rather long-term concept to materialize as a digital future for masses.\nWith that being said, let\u2019s move to the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders:\u00a0108\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) serves as the high-performance and adaptive computing leader. The firm operates through multiple segments including Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded. For over 45 years, AMD has driven innovation in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies which serve as the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms, and the datacenter.\nThe chip maker made its way into the metaverse when it landed Meta as its customer and stated that Meta would use AMD\u2019s EPYC chips in its data centers. AMD further collaborated with Meta Platforms to make the metaverse a reality. Under this collaboration, AMD\u2019s radio chip Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC enabled the development of multiple Evenstar radio units to expand the 4G/5G global mobile network infrastructure. Additionally, AMD supplies chips to the leading gaming console makers such as Microsoft and Sony which engage in the virtual world. AMD chips power the PS5 and the Xbox Series X.\nAMD recorded Q3 revenue of $6.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by increased sales of EPYC and Instinct data center products and strong demand for Ryzen PC processors. While Record Data Center segment revenue of $3.5 billion was up 122% year-over-year, Client segment revenue was up 29% year-over-year. The firm is on track to deliver record annual revenue for 2024 based on significant growth in its Data Center and Client segments.\nWith the metaverse driving the demand for graphics cards and processors, AMD is in a good spot to reap the benefits. As of Q2, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0 is held by 108 hedge funds.\nOverall AMD ranks 5th on our list of the other Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\u201d\nAlthough there might be a lack of connection between the metaverse which was the next big thing two years ago and the prevailing tech landscape dominated by AI, some argue that the reports of the metaverse\u2019s death are \u2018exaggerated\u2019 and that it is a rather long-term concept to materialize as a digital future for masses.\nWith that being said, let\u2019s move to the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies.

An activist hedge fund usually follows an event-driven strategy and acquires sufficient equity to influence a company's policies, to increase company value. ValueAct has a long history of investing in technology companies and is generally considered to be more constructivist and collaborative than other activist funds.\nValueAct did not immediately respond to Benzinga\u2019s request for comment.\nIn 2022, Brad Gerstner\u2018s Altimeter Capital targeted Meta, urging the company to reduce its workforce. Gerstner articulated his concerns in a letter titled \u201cTime to Get Fit.\nValueAct fund's specific intentions remain unclear, but CEO Morfit is reportedly supportive of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s strategic focus on advancing artificial intelligence initiatives, according to CNBC.\nWhy It Matters: According to its Q3 13F filing, ValueAct has acquired a passive stake in the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, namely, Meta. It is one of the largest companies to be targeted by an activist investor, with a market cap of nearly $1.5 trillion. The hedge fund also increased its investment in The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) by adding 1.33 million shares taking its total value to $718.04 million in ValueAct\u2019s portfolio.\nCheck It Out: The Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "whole_article": "The post-election rally of Wall Street after Donald Trump became President for the second term, has evaporated. As the initial euphoria of market participants is over, investors are assessing the pros and cons of Trump\u2019s economic policies, such as the imposition of tariffs, reduction of corporate taxes, deregulation of corporate America and their impact on inflation.\nThe technology sector is also concerned about Trump\u2019s tariffs on high-end chipsets, the future of the $52.5 billion Chips and Science Act and the imposition of antitrust regulations on big techs. Nevertheless, I believe that the AI frenzy will continue as this technology has become the need of the hour.\nAt this stage, we recommend five generative artificial intelligence (AI) behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank that have double-digit upside potential in the short term. These are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nAI Frenzy Remains Intact\nThe astonishing rally of U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative AI technology across the world was the prime factor.\nBloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending will increase from $67 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. UBS estimated that four U.S. technology giants that are member of the so-called \u201cmagnificent 7\u201d will spend around $267 billion as capital expenditure on AI applications in 2025, a jump of 33.5% year over year.\n5 AI Bigwigs to Buy With Double-Digit Short-Term Appreciation\nEach of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI (Gen AI) solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products. GOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance search results continue to boost traffic on GOOGL\u2019s search engine.\nStory Continues\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 17.6% from the last closing price of $175.58. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $185-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 36.7% and no downside.\nMeta Platforms Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Meta Platforms is set to receive initial shipments of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s (NVDA) new flagship AI chip later this year. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META is set to get B200 Blackwell chips.\nMETA\u2019s AI-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms. Management said that the company will invest $38-$40 billion as capital expenditure in AI initiatives in 2024. Moreover, capital spending is likely to reach more than $50 billion in 2025.\nOn July 24, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA\u2019s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbents like Open AI.\nStrong Price Upside Potential for META Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $577.16. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $475-$811. This indicates a maximum upside of 40.5% and a maximum downside of 17.7%.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\nZacks Rank #1 Taiwan Semiconductor is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world\u2019s best AI chipset developers. It has a strong clientele. The company is the largest manufacturer of NVIDIA\u2019s chipsets. NVIDIA is globally the largest developer of generative AI-based chips.\nTSM provides a range of wafer fabrication processes, including processes to manufacture complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, embedded memory, bipolar CMOS mixed-signal, and others.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is experiencing solid demand for its advanced technologies, such as 3-nanometer (nm) and 5nm. The growing adoption of its multi-project wafer processing service, which allows customers to reduce mask costs, is driving its customer momentum.\nTSM\u2019s growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus. Also, strength across its 7nm, 16nm and 28nm technologies are contributing well to its top-line growth.\nExcellent Price Upside Potential for TSM Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19.2% from the last closing price of $188.50. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $200-$250. This indicates a maximum upside of 32.6% and no downside.\nAdobe Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Adobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster.\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects.

The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703. This indicates a maximum upside of 32.7% and a maximum downside of 17%.\nBroadcom Inc.\nBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers. AVGO\u2019s solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers.\nThe acquisition of VMware has benefited the infrastructure software solutions of Broadcom. VMware\u2019s expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy. AVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\nSolid Price Upside Potential for AVGO Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 12.5% from the last closing price of $170.38.

The recent rise in its shares pushed Nvidia to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.6tn (\u00a32.8tn).\nShares rose earlier this week after Nvidia said that Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) would be the first to receive its AI Blackwell chips.\nThis came as part of a series of collaborations with SoftBank that Nvidia announced on Tuesday.\nRead more: How Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote speech at the chipmaker's AI Summit in Japan, that SoftBank would be using its Blackwell platform to build Japan's most powerful AI supercomputer.\nIn addition, Nvidia also revealed that SoftBank, using the chipmaker's AI Aerial computing platform, had piloted the world's first combined AI and 5G telecom network.\nThe attention now turns to Nvidia's third-quarter results for its 2025 fiscal year, with the chipmaker having guided to revenue of $32.5bn, plus or minus 2%, for the period in its previous quarterly report.\nStory continues\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Markets forecasts expect that number to be a little higher. If NVIDIA continues its strong run of beating market expectations, things could be better still.\"\n\"There\u2019s likely to be more emphasis however on the outlook for the final three months of the year, where consensus is currently looking for revenue of $36.6bn.\"\nIn the second quarter, revenue came in at $30bn, which was 122% higher than the previous year. Nvidia posted earnings per diluted share of $0.67, which was up 168% on the previous year.\n\"Any steer as to how well the recently launched ultra-fast Blackwell chip is selling will also be closely scrutinised,\" Nathan said.\n\"There\u2019s no shortage of demand as the likes of Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) look to gain an edge in the AI race. But there remain some unanswered questions about Nvidia\u2019s supply chain\u2019s ability to keep pace.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nWalmart (WMT) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Tuesday 19 November\nWall Street will keeping an eye on retailer Walmart's latest results to see if it reports another solid quarter, as consumer price pressures persist.\nLatest data showed consumer prices grew by 2.6% in October, which was a slight uptick for the 2.4% rate of inflation recorded in September.\nThe figure was still above the US Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target but was in line with with expectations, sustaining investor hopes that the central bank will potentially cut interest rates again in December.\nHowever, there are concerns that potential policies around trade tariffs from president-elect Donald Trump, after he returns to the White House in January, could drive inflation higher.\nAs the world's largest retailer by sales, Walmart's results can provide an insight into US consumer sentiment.\nRead more: UK growth slows between July and September as services sector falters\nIn the second quarter, Walmart (WMT) logged revenue growth of 4.8% of $169.34bn, beating estimates of $168.46bn.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.67 also beat expectations of $0.65 and marked a 9.8% increase year-on-year.\nThis strong performance contributed to a 61% rise in Walmart shares year-to-date.\nCEO Doug McMillon said: \"Each part of our business is growing \u2013 store and club sales are up, e-commerce is compounding as we layer on pickup and even faster growth in delivery as our speed improves.\"\nFor the third quarter, Walmart guided to an increase of 3.25% to 4.25% in consolidated net sales, compared with the same period last year when it delivered $159.4bn in net sales.\nWalmart said it was expecting consolidated operating income to rise between 3% and 4.5% in the third quarter, up from $6.2bn last year.\nThe company expected adjusted earnings per share to come in at $0.51 to $0.52, compared with $0.51 for the third quarter last year.\n\u2022 USD\n(WMT)\nFollow\nView quote details\nImperial Brands (IMB.L) \u2014 Reports full-year results on Tuesday 19 November\nShares in tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMB.L) are currently trading at a five-year high, with the stock up 31% year-to-date.\nThat's despite the higher duties on cigarettes and vapes announced in the recent UK autumn budget.\n\"These moves add to a long list of regulatory and tax measures designed to deter consumers from smoking, after interventions on advertising and packaging design,\" said AJ Bell's Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth.\nEven so, the investment experts said that Imperial Brands continues to see strong profits and cash generation, much of which could be attributed to the five-year plan set out by CEO Stefan Bomhard, who took the reins in 2020.\nIn its full year results last year, Imperial Brands posted a 7.1% decline in tobacco volumes (excluding Russia), but the company raised its prices by an average of 11%. Sales in its next generation product segment rose 26%.\nRead more: Rachel Reeves hints at looser regulation in bid to improve UK's competitiveness\n\"Imperial will be looking to a similar recipe in the year to September 2024, for which chief executive Stefan Bomhard gave clear guidance alongside the full-year results for 2023 back in November,\" said Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth.\nIn its half-year results, Imperial Brands said it expected to deliver revenue growth in the low-single digits on a constant currency basis for its tobacco and next generation products segments.\nThe company forecast that adjusted operating profit would grow by close to the middle of its mid-single digit range.\nOn the back of this guidance, AJ Bell's investment experts said that analysts were expecting group adjusted operating profit of \u00a33.9bn, which would be flat on the previous year.\nAnalysts were also said to be expecting adjusted earnings per share of \u00a32.95, up from \u00a32.79 last year.\nIn terms of its dividend, Imperial Brands has produced three consecutive increases in the payout, with analysts said to be looking for another advance to \u00a31.53 per share in this set of results. The company also recently announced a further share buyback of \u00a31.25bn, which it is set to complete by the end of October 2025.\n\u2022 USD\n(IMB.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nJD Sports (JD.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter trading update on Thursday 21 November\nSportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) had a tougher start to its fiscal year but Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the situation has since picked up for the business.

        "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nNYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nIn Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThere\u2019s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump\u2019s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.\nBut there\u2019s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate \u2014 especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect \u2014 and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.\nThese cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk\u2019s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up less than 1%, while Facebook parent Meta is down 0.6%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 3.5%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 2%.\nAs the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they\u2019re thinking about. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying:\nTiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:\n\u201cTariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.\nWe have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.\u201d\nMark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we\u2019ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.\nI don\u2019t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.\u201d\nMark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.\n\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she\u2019s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.\u201d\nThreats against Alphabet and Meta are \u201cjust talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn\u2019t take kindly to that. However, I don\u2019t think anything like this will make it into policy.\u201d\nKevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management\n\u201cTrump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn\u2019t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn\u2019t put him the best light.\nThe thing that\u2019s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That\u2019s a counter perspective to that. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren\u2019t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.\nI don\u2019t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined. I have exposure to Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple. I don\u2019t know how tariffs will impact Nvidia, since the demand will remain there no matter what. Broadcom goes kind of hand in hand with that. I think that at Apple, Cook will take steps to keep the products from exploding in price.\u201d\nAdam Grossman, chief investment officer of global equity at Riverfront Investment Group:\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unclear a week after the election. I do think he could get tariffs through on China, but getting tariffs through on Europe, that\u2019s another ball of wax.\nFor someone like Donald Trump, I think he\u2019s going to have enough other issues that they\u2019re going to kind of fly off of his radar.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nChinese tech conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering an offering of bonds totaling the equivalent of about $5 billion as soon as this month, people familiar with the matter said.\nElon Musk\u2019s social media platform X sued to block a California law aimed at curbing AI-generated deceptive election content on social media, claiming the measure is an unconstitutional affront to free speech.\nMeta Platforms Inc. said it intends to appeal court rulings allowing dozens of states and hundreds of school districts across the US to proceed with lawsuits blaming \u201caddictive\u201d social media apps for contributing to a mental health crisis among youths.\nSamsung Electronics Co. plans to buy back about 10 trillion won ($7.2 billion) of its own stock over the next year, putting in motion one of the larger shareholder return programs in its history.\nLenovo Group Ltd. hiked its projection for global PC shipments in 2025 after posting better-than-expected earnings, saying AI features will help boost growth next year.\nEarnings Due Friday\nPremarket\nAlibaba\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nCEOs Brace for the Chaos of Another Four Years of Trump\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nBetting on Tesla Helped Ron Baron Beat the Index.

Under FTC Chair Lina Khan\u2019s leadership, regulators aggressively pursued cases against the industry\u2019s biggest companies, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\nTrump, on the other hand, has promised to cut excess red tape, including his promise to throw out Biden\u2019s executive order aimed at putting safety guardrails on AI \u2014 a move that would be viewed as controversial by those within the industry.\nWhile Trump\u2019s antitrust agendas remain uncertain, there seems to be growing optimism that he'll employ a more hands-off approach compared to Biden.\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to rally further into year-end as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump with Khan/FTC days in the rear view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCisco (CSCO) CFO Scott Herren is confident in the company\u2019s momentum heading into 2025.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks to watch on latest news and analyst ratings.\nAI discussion boards online are buzzing with a new development where tech experts are pointing to a possible plateauing of performance in artificial intelligence applications.\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa in a latest program quoted tech investor Ben Horowitz, who said in a recent podcast that he\u2019s not seeing performance improvement despite increasing GPUs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasing GPUs at the same rate, but we\u2019re not getting the intelligence improvements at all out of it.\u201d\nOpenAI is reportedly facing similar problems with its upcoming AI model.\n\u201cThe Information reports that the quality increase in OpenAI\u2019s upcoming advanced model, Orion, is smaller than the jump seen between the last two flagship models, GPT-3 and GPT-4. In other words, generational advancements may have peaked as the models are essentially running out of data to train on,\u201d Bosa said.\nWhile the next jump in AI performance is far away in the future, the possibilities this technology has unlocked based on the existing data and resources are keeping investors and Wall Street analysts busy.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks.\nIn this article we take a look at top AI stocks trending on the back of latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nUBS analyst David Vogt said in a recent note that Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0store\u2019s revenue growth in October was solid. However, he remains cautious amid challenging comps and expectations that iPhone sell-throughs won\u2019t improve as of December.\n\u201cHowever, we remain cautious as the rest of the December quarter faces similarly challenging comps in the ~13% range, while iPhone sell-through is unlikely to accelerate, typically a source of incremental App Store demand.\u201d\nStory Continues\nVogt, who has a Neutral rating and a $236 price target on Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), added that it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to attribute the strength to Apple Intelligence, given that iOS 18.1 was released on October 28, but noted the growth is a \u201cpositive data point\u201d compared to Apple\u2019s guidance for its Services segment.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\nThe largest relative detractors during the quarter were\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), Airbnb, and Tesla (not owned). We added a new position in Apple during the period, which we discuss further in the following section. While Apple is a roughly average-sized position in Focus Growth, it is the largest holding in the Russell 1000 Growth Index, at over 12%, and the stock\u2019s outperformance in the quarter weighed on relative results.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks to watch on latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

For India's Tata, the Chennai Pegatron plant will bolster its iPhone manufacturing plans.\nTata is one of the largest conglomerates in India and has been fast expanding into iPhone manufacturing, rivaling the only other iPhone contract manufacturer operating in India, Foxconn.\nThe announcement for the deal's closure was made internally at the iPhone plant on Friday, said the first source.\nThe second source said the two companies plan to file for an approval of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in the coming days.\nTata already operates an iPhone assembly plant in the southern state of Karnataka, which it took over from Taiwan's Wistron last year. It is also building another in Hosur in Tamil Nadu, where it also has an iPhone component plant which was involved in a fire incident in September.\nAnalysts estimate India will contribute 20-25% of total iPhone shipments this year, from 12-14% last year.\nThe Tata-Pegatron plant, which has around 10,000 employees and makes 5 million iPhones annually, will be Tata's third iPhone factory in India.\n(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed higher on Thursday despite an overall decline in the stock market.\nConsumer group Which? has filed a \u00a33 billion ($3.81 billion) legal claim against Apple, accusing the tech giant of breaching UK competition law through its iCloud service.\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) reduced stake in Apple from 400 million to 300 million shares. Thus, Berkshire has now cut its position in the Cupertino, California-based tech giant by over two-thirds since 2023's third quarter.\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.44%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\nTrending: Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,369,320 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $273,864 or around 1,200 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nSee Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nStory Continues\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nYou Can Profit From Real Estate Without Being A Landlord\nReal estate is a great way to diversify your portfolio and earn high returns, but it can also be a big hassle. Luckily, there are other ways to tap into the power of real estate without owning property. Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other best metaverse stocks.\nWhat is the Metaverse?\nAccording to McKinsey & Company, the metaverse is the emerging 3-D-enabled digital space that uses virtual reality, augmented reality, and other advanced internet and semiconductor technology to allow people to have lifelike experiences online.\nThe basic features of the metaverse include a sense of immersion, real-time interactivity, and user agency. Whereas, the full vision of the metaverse encompasses platforms and devices that work seamlessly with each other, the possibility for thousands of people to interact simultaneously, and use cases well beyond gaming. While the phenomenon gained attention in 2021 with internet searches for the term increasing by 7,200%, it seems here to stay. With lockdowns and work-from-home policies in place, the interest in shared virtual environments spiked. The opportunity remains vast with metaverse having the potential to generate up to $5 trillion in value by 2030.\nIs the Metaverse Still Alive?\nWhen the tech guru Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook\u2019s name to Meta in 2021, he clearly drove the metaverse narrative in the world. Although the vision of a digital future of work and recreation became a buzz for a while, other emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence decided to dominate the headlines later.\nQuestions regarding whether Zuckerberg should have transformed a successful social media company into a VR venture have also been asked. In September 2023, BBC reported that his company\u2019s virtual and augmented reality branch, Reality Labs, has lost $21 billion since the prior year. The firm later introduced its social virtual reality space Horizon Worlds. While some users have complained about not having enough people to make it fun, the platform\u2019s monthly users can simply not match the number of people who consume social media like Facebook and Instagram every day.\nAlthough the company\u2019s virtual reality headset and its Horizon Worlds have not gone mainstream after 3 years of the company\u2019s founding, experts argue that the metaverse is still as relevant as ever. On October 2, CNBC reported that Zuckerberg\u2019s metaverse is finally showing signs of life as his company might have found its footing in VR and AR through a different medium, smart glasses. After the firm witnessed early success in the market for smart glasses via a partnership with Ray-Ban, the CEO unveiled the first \u201cfully-functioning\u201d prototype AR glasses, Orion, in September.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe right way to look at Orion is as a time machine. These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\u201d\nAlthough there might be a lack of connection between the metaverse which was the next big thing two years ago and the prevailing tech landscape dominated by AI, some argue that the reports of the metaverse\u2019s death are \u2018exaggerated\u2019 and that it is a rather long-term concept to materialize as a digital future for masses.\nOur Methodology\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders:\u00a0184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is well known for its smartphones, also makes the hardware that blends the digital and the virtual world. While the Mac introduced Apple to personal computing, and the iPhone introduced it to mobile computing, the firm stepped into the metaverse as it debuted its virtual reality headset.\nThe iPhone maker launched its Vision Pro headset at its annual WWDC event in June 2023. As a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, the firm claimed the device as to be years ahead and unlike anything created before. It builds upon Apple\u2019s innovation and experience designing high-performance products such as the Mac, iPhone, and wearables like the Apple Watch.\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended September 28, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported revenue of $94.9 billion, a record September quarter revenue driven by iPhone. Additionally, Apple\u2019s active installed base of devices hit a new all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. During the quarter, the firm was excited to announce the new iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4.\nThus, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to benefit from its leading innovation, expertise, and a potential surge in demand for AR/VR devices with the growth in the metaverse. The stock is held by 184 hedge funds, as of Q2.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The recent rise in its shares pushed Nvidia to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.6tn (\u00a32.8tn).\nShares rose earlier this week after Nvidia said that Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) would be the first to receive its AI Blackwell chips.\nThis came as part of a series of collaborations with SoftBank that Nvidia announced on Tuesday.\nRead more: How Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote speech at the chipmaker's AI Summit in Japan, that SoftBank would be using its Blackwell platform to build Japan's most powerful AI supercomputer.\nIn addition, Nvidia also revealed that SoftBank, using the chipmaker's AI Aerial computing platform, had piloted the world's first combined AI and 5G telecom network.\nThe attention now turns to Nvidia's third-quarter results for its 2025 fiscal year, with the chipmaker having guided to revenue of $32.5bn, plus or minus 2%, for the period in its previous quarterly report.\nStory continues\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Markets forecasts expect that number to be a little higher.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), has wrapped up his recent sale of Amazon shares. Last week, Bezos sold off Amazon stock worth $1.3 billion, taking his total sales for November to a whopping $3.4 billion.\nWhat Happened:\u00a0Bezos has offloaded a total of $5.1 billion worth of Amazon stock since July. These sales were carried out under a prearranged trading plan known as 10b5-1, a common practice among large shareholders.\nBarron\u2019s\u00a0reports that this plan, which was announced in May, replaced a previous one and was designed for Bezos to sell 25 million Amazon shares by the end of 2025.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nOver the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% \u2014 Investors like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nBezos has completed his sales ahead of schedule. His last trade under the plan was conducted on Wednesday, where he sold 39,538 shares for approximately $8 million.\nThis transaction took his total share sales since July to the planned 25 million, marking the end of the current plan.\nWhile Amazon has chosen not to comment on the stock sales, investors are eagerly awaiting the announcement of a new plan, possibly in Amazon\u2019s next quarterly report.\nDespite the massive sales, Bezos still holds over a billion Amazon shares, valued at $213 billion.\nWhy It Matters:\u00a0Bezos\u2019 massive sell-off of Amazon shares, totaling $5.1 billion since July, has been a topic of interest among investors.\nThe sales were conducted under a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, which is commonly used by large shareholders to avoid accusations of insider trading.\nThe completion of this plan ahead of schedule has sparked anticipation for the announcement of a new plan, potentially to be revealed in Amazon\u2019s upcoming quarterly report.\nDespite the large-scale sales, Bezos remains a major shareholder in Amazon, with over a billion shares valued at $213 billion.\nRead Next:\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate.

        "whole_article": "Billionaire Tom Steyer cares about politics.\nHe ran for president in 2020 on a climate-friendly agenda, which was followed by his opponents in the Democratic primary solidifying their climate proposals. Since then, he\u2019s founded Galvanize Climate Solutions, an investment firm focused on climate impact, which former Secretary of State John Kerry recently joined as co-executive chair.\nGiven that context, you\u2019d think Steyer would be nervous about the next four years with the election of Donald Trump, who is likely to exit the Paris Climate Agreement again.\nBut in an interview at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference, Steyer stated, \u201cTo a very large extent, it doesn't matter\u201d who is in the White House. As he sees it, climate solutions will win in the free market.\nSteyer pointed to the energy transition that\u2019s already taking place in \u201cdeep red states\u201d across the country. Texas, for instance, is the biggest wind energy producer in the United States despite state legislation that excludes wind projects from tax breaks and favors fossil fuels.\n\"Why are they doing that? Because of the money,\" Steyer said. \"This is business. This is economics. Nobody gets to get away from the rules of markets and prices.\"\nSteyer's comments mirror Apollo (APO) CEO Marc Rowan\u2019s view that the US needs to get on board with the energy transition or it risks getting left behind, which is part of why Rowan is \u201cincredibly optimistic\u201d about four more years under Trump. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\n\"Those countries that build power, that support data, that support advanced data, advanced AI, advanced power are going to win,\" Rowan said. \"Those that don't are going to be left behind. This is going to be table stakes.\u201d\nInnovation fueling change in government is part of the thesis behind Steyer\u2019s latest book, \"Cheaper, Faster, Better.\" In the book, the billionaire argues that consumer demand for climate-related innovations, which are often cheaper as well, will drive adoption.\nOne example is electric vehicles. Kelley Blue Book reported that EVs now make up about 9% of the car market in the US, nearing a critical 10% adoption threshold. The falling cost of EV ownership has contributed to this trend.\nSince this data came out, however, the incoming Trump administration announced it plans to roll back EV tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, which could reverse this trend.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer speaks at \"Our Rights, Our Courts\" forum New Hampshire Technical Institute's Concord Community College, Saturday, Feb. 8, 2020, in Concord, N.H. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe next wave of climate investments\nFor investors who want high impact and high returns, Steyer said to stick with the fundamentals.\nStory Continues\n\u201cPeople think that the breakthroughs in the technologies are going be gadgets ... electric vehicles, batteries, things you can touch,\" Steyer said. \"I think there's going be a whole other part of this economy absolutely relevant to climate where returns are going to be really good.\"\nSome areas of investment Steyer is bullish on include real estate, credit, carbon sequestration, and agriculture. Steyer's firm has a real estate fund that focuses on optimizing properties for energy efficiency savings to increase the underlying property value, which fits Steyer\u2019s interest in investments that can solve problems in the next decade rather than over the long term.\nOne such solution that\u2019s getting a lot of attention and investment in the tech world is nuclear energy, with Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG) all pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the space.\nRead what top decision-makers are saying at Yahoo Finance's Invest event:\nBillionaire Tom Steyer: Trump presidency won\u2019t hold back the energy transition\nAnduril CEO sees opportunity for defense tech startups under Trump\nHow Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could affect the cost of jeans, appliances, and everyday items\nBut Steyer doesn\u2019t see a bull case there yet.\n\u201cJust being part of the energy transition doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good investment,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou\u2019d have to be awfully aggressive\u201d to see nuclear fusion energy scale in the next decade. Even nuclear fission, the form of nuclear energy deployed in power plants today, has risks that should be evaluated closely.\nThe success of longer-term bets like nuclear energy may depend on investments from Big Tech, which has been willing to take on riskier investments, since the future of its business depends on energy usage.\n\u201cMicrosoft is definitely really serious about their responsibilities in terms of emissions and climate,\" Steyer said. \"So they're willing to go and try something that's difficult to do and maybe controversial to do.\u201d\nRegardless of which climate solution wins or who sits in the Oval Office, Steyer believes the momentum toward solving the climate crisis is clear.\n\u201cIn my mind, from the standpoint as an American, I would like to see us continue to be a world leader, both from a business standpoint, an economic standpoint, and also a value standpoint,\u201d he said.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

Per Modern Retail, the accuracy of these images, in relation to the product being sold, is not the best.\nStory Continues\nOverall, AMZN ranks 4th on our list of AI news that broke the internet this week. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "whole_article": "Key Insights\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Amazon.com implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 47% ownership\nInsiders own 10% of Amazon.com\nA look at the shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 63% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amazon.com, beginning with the chart below.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\nNasdaqGS:AMZN Ownership Breakdown November 17th 2024\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amazon.com?\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nAmazon.com already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amazon.com's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nNasdaqGS:AMZN Earnings and Revenue Growth November 17th 2024\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Amazon.com is not owned by hedge funds. Our data suggests that Jeffrey Bezos, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 8.7%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.7% and 6.2% of the stock.\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\nStory Continues\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of Amazon.com\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Amazon.com, Inc.. Insiders own US$223b worth of shares in the US$2.1t company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\nMany find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

She recently sold another $8 billion worth of Amazon shares and is using the money to help charities nationwide.\nDon't Miss:\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Last chance to get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share before prices change next week!\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nScott, who was previously married to Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has decided to use her money to try to change the world. Since their 2019 divorce, she has received a large amount of Amazon shares, making her one of the wealthiest people on the planet. But unlike many other billionaires, she isn't keeping all that money for herself. Instead, she's giving it away quickly, recently selling 11% of her Amazon shares to support nonprofits, per filings.\nSince the divorce, Scott has sold or donated 255 million Amazon shares, worth about $37 billion. That's huge, especially since she has done it in less than six years. Instead of holding onto her wealth, Scott focuses on giving back by providing grants to organizations working on education, health, poverty and economic opportunities.\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date.\nAfter graduating from Princeton University, she moved to New York City to follow her dream of becoming a writer. She had to take different jobs, like waitressing, just to pay her bills and these hard times taught her what it feels like to struggle with money, which made her want to help others in need.\nSome groups that have received her donations include the Housing Trust Silicon Valley, which got $30 million to help make affordable housing and the Jewish Vocational Service in Boston, which received $7 million to help families become more financially stable. These donations are just a small part of her giving. Scott has already given more than $17 billion to over 2,300 nonprofits, making her one of the most generous people in the U.S.\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling Through UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

Forbes estimates that her wealth decreased from $59 billion in 2021 to about $30 billion in late September. She pledged to donate as much as she could over her lifetime when she joined The Giving Pledge in 2019.\nStory Continues\nScott's way of giving is different from that of most billionaires. She focuses on smaller, community-based organizations, often giving them unrestricted funds \u2013 money they can use however they need without any conditions. For many of these groups, getting a donation from Scott is more than just the money. It is also a sign of trust, which can help them get more donations from others.\nRead Next:\nWith over 7.8K investors including Meta, Google, And Amazon Execs \u2014 this AI Startup's valuation has skyrocketed from $5 million to $85 million in just three years.

The market is huge \u2014 a potential $150 billion a year by the end of the decade \u2014 and any financial miss, or negative data of any kind, will trigger outsized sell-offs.\nThis past week, for example, Amgen (AMGN) lost $12 billion in market value. Hims & Hers (HIMS) lost 10% in a single day in October when the FDA ended the shortage designation of Eli Lilly's (LLY) drugs. (Its worst day on record was Nov. 14, down 24% after Amazon (AMZN) launched a direct prescription service modeled after the company.)\nLast month was the most dramatic, when Lilly saw more than $127 billion in stock value wiped out at peak loss in a single day.

(Investors bought the Lilly dip and the loss was pared to $54 billion by market close).\nThe recovery in the stock came only after CEO David Ricks responded to an analyst question on an earnings call about the sales miss, saying that demand was up 25% quarter over quarter. The stock started to pick up right after that, according to Citi healthcare analyst Geoff Meacham.\nHow volatile is that? The move seen in Lilly's stock is typically reserved for Magnificent Seven stocks. For example, the day after the election, Tesla's (TSLA) market cap increased by $120 billion.\nThe day of Lilly's loss, another company on its way into the GLP-1 space was grappling with what the sell-off could mean for its future.\nAmgen CFO Peter Griffith told Yahoo Finance the company, whose GLP-1 candidate MariTide is still only in mid-stage clinical trials, was worried investors were going to change how they rewarded the company's stock \u2014 from weighing overall performance to focusing on a single product.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that MariTide \u2026 will eclipse the rest of our news here in the near future,\u201d Griffith said, unaware at the time he would face that exact fate two weeks later.\nThe company's stock was hammered Nov. 12 after older MariTide data published by an analyst briefly appeared to highlight a problematic side effect, which was quickly waved off by other analysts and Amgen itself.\n\u2022 USD\n(LLY)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMore volatility?\nThe potential for high returns has created an energy around the leading GLP-1 companies \u2014 and serves as a cautionary tale for those that will follow.\n\u201cThere are more eyeballs on Novo and Lilly than any other stock in healthcare, by a mile. That alone is going to read more volatility,\u201d said Mizuho's healthcare sector expert Jared Holz.\nStory Continues\nSome investors are looking for consistently large returns quarter over quarter and only care about the GLP-1 drugs.\n\u201cNo one even asks a question outside of obesity on the Lilly or Novo [earnings] conference calls.

        "whole_article": "Listen and subscribe to Yahoo Finance Sports Report on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\nJoey Logano lifted the trophy in Phoenix this past weekend, winning his third NASCAR Championship in the last six years after beating his teammate Ryan Blaney by just 0.330 seconds.\nAnd while many fans plead with NASCAR to change the playoff format that allowed a driver with just one win in the regular season to take home a championship, America\u2019s most popular and profitable racing series has its sights set on the future.\nNASCAR signed a historic media rights extension last year worth $7.7 billion over seven years. The deal provides inventory to four broadcasters \u2014 Fox (FOX), NBC (CMCSA), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 who will split 38 races across their channels each year starting with the 2025 season.\n\u201dWhen we were having discussions about the deal itself, we made a big deal about promotion, and [Amazon] told us that they were going to treat us at the level of the NFL,\u201d NASCAR president Steve Phelps said on Yahoo Finance Sports Report. \u201cAnd that\u2019s saying something. I think they\u2019ve had tremendous success, and the growth that they\u2019ve had with Thursday Night Football has been extraordinary.\u201d\nThe deal kicks in after a somewhat tumultuous year for the sport.\nThe 2024 NASCAR season was a slog, both on and off the track. Rain at the season-opening Daytona 500 pushed NASCAR\u2019s most popular race from Sunday to Monday, resulting in a 27% drop in viewership right out of the gate. Things got worse when a handful of NASCAR\u2019s other most popular races \u2014 Coca-Cola 600, Clash at the Coliseum, Chicago Street Race \u2014 saw double-digit viewership declines due to rain.\nAdd in a lawsuit from the sport\u2019s most popular owner, Michael Jordan of 23XI Racing, and it would be fair to assume that NASCAR\u2019s leadership lost some sleep this year.\nBut while there undoubtedly were some challenging moments, NASCAR fought back throughout its 36-race schedule to quietly put up a very good season.\nNASCAR races averaged 2.892 million viewers this year. That\u2019s a respectable 1% increase year over year, considering how things started in Daytona, and it means NASCAR is still roughly 2.5 times bigger than Formula 1 in the United States.\nNASCAR also continued to attract blue-chip sponsors, bringing in $362 million in sponsorship revenue this year through deals with a host of publicly traded companies, including Goodyear (GT), Xfinity (CMCSA), Chevrolet (GM), Toyota (TM), Coca-Cola (KO), Ford (F), and GEICO.\nNASCAR has only four sponsorship deals with companies based outside the US right now, but the company will look to change that as it hosts the first-ever Cup Series race in Mexico City next year.\nStory Continues\nAnd NASCAR\u2019s new TV deal will likely help \u2014 as long as more viewers can follow along.\nJoey Logano, driver of the #22 Shell Pennzoil Ford, celebrates in victory lane after winning the NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race at Phoenix Raceway on Nov. 10, 2024, in Avondale, Ariz. (James Gilbert/Getty Images) \u00b7 James Gilbert via Getty Images\nThere are some concerns that fans may struggle with discoverability, as NASCAR races will now be broadcast across five different platforms \u2014 including a mix of broadcast, cable, and streaming. Nevertheless, NASCAR felt comfortable with the deal because it secured the company a near-35% increase in media rights, and it also convinced the new media companies to cross-promote races that appear on other channels.\n\u201cWe believe that our fanbase will migrate to Amazon Prime,\u201d NASCAR\u2019s Phelps said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got well into the 70s the percentage of NASCAR fans who have Amazon Prime. So that, to me, bodes well, and I think we\u2019re going to prove that streaming will be an important element for NASCAR racing well into the future.\u201d\nThe $7.7 billion media rights deal is part of NASCAR\u2019s overall push to modernize the sport. NASCAR recently renewed its Netflix series, \"NASCAR: Full Speed,\" for a second season after data revealed it was bringing in a younger, more female audience, and the sport\u2019s leadership team invested $53 million to open a new production facility.\nThese investments have already paid dividends for NASCAR, both domestically and internationally. The sport held races in 12 countries on three different continents in 2024. NASCAR is now broadcast in 185 countries and territories worldwide, reaching over 500 million households, and a mix of more innovative formats (Chicago Street Race) and host cities (Mexico City) should continue to push the sport to new heights.\nYahoo Finance Sports Report with Joe Pompliano looks beyond the latest sports business headlines, breaking down the teams, trades, and billion-dollar deals.

        "whole_article": "Is it possible that a former YouTuber can take down the baddest man on the planet?\nJake Paul (10-1), whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes YouTube celebrity, marketer and prizefighter, will face former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson (50-6) in a sanctioned eight-round bout. It\u2019s a marketing event for the ages, as Paul is the young up-and-comer, who started fighting professionally in January 2020, building his record against former UFC fighters and fellow YouTubers.\nTyson\u2019s legacy is set, but he\u2019s also 58 years old, so a win is far from certain. Paul also has a longer reach and stands three inches taller than Tyson.\nThe fight will be a bit different than a typical heavyweight bout. Rounds will last just two minutes instead of the traditional three. And both fighters will wear 14-ounce gloves instead of the traditional 10-ounce ones.\nIt\u2019s expected to be the biggest live event in live streaming history for host network Netflix. Here\u2019s all you need to know about how to catch the action.\nWhen are Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fighting?\nPaul and Tyson will square off on Friday, Nov. 15.\nWhat time does the Tyson vs. Paul fight begin?\nThe card gets underway at 8:00 p.m. ET. There\u2019s an undercard with six additional fights, however (only three of which will air on Netflix), so there\u2019s no telling exactly when Paul and Tyson will take to the ring.\nWhy is this fight happening?\nPublicity and cash. Paul is an expert at snagging the media\u2019s attention, so challenging someone who has a reputation like Tyson is an easy way to steal the spotlight. Celebrity boxing has also become more popular in the past 20 years or so, guaranteeing an audience. Plus, there\u2019s a $40 million purse up for grabs\u2014and that\u2019s appealing to both boxers. \u201cI\u2019m here to make $40m and knock out a legend,\u201d Paul said at a news conference in August.\nFor Tyson, it\u2019s a chance to cement his legacy at an age where most boxers are long past their prime.\nCan I watch Tyson vs. Paul fight for free?\nNot unless you have a friend who subscribes to Netflix and they invite you over. The fight will not be broadcast on traditional TV or other streaming services.\nCan I stream the Paul vs. Tyson fight live online if I don't have a cable subscription?\nYes, but you only have one option.\nNetflix\nThe streaming king is the exclusive home of Paul vs. Tyson. There\u2019s no free trial, but you can cancel at any time. Plans start at $6.99 per month for the ad-supported option and $15.49 for ad-free.\nWhen is the last time Mike Tyson fought?\nTyson hasn\u2019t fought in an official bout since 2005, when he was downed in the sixth round by a TKO from Kevin McBride. He hasn\u2019t been in the ring since Nov. 28, 2020, when he met Roy Jones Jr. in an eight-round exhibition. That fight was declared a draw.\nStory Continues\nWasn\u2019t the Paul vs. Tyson fight supposed to happen months ago?\nIt was! Paul and Tyson were originally set to meet on July 20, but Tyson had to cancel after he became ill. His team later cited an \u201culcer problem\u201d that landed him in the hospital.\nWhat is the undercard for Paul vs. Tyson?\nKatie Taylor (23-1) vs. Amanda Serrano (47-2-1); WBC, WBA, WBO, IBF junior welterweight titles\nMario Barrios (29-2) vs. Abel Ramos (28-6-2); WBC welterweight title\nNeeraj Goyat (18-4-2) vs. Whindersson Nunes (debut)\nPreliminary fights (will stream on Most Valuable Promotions and Netflix Sports' YouTube channels)\nShadasia Green (14-1) vs. Melinda Watpool (7-0); WBO super middleweight title\nLucas Bahdi (17-0) vs. Armando Casamonica (14-0)\nBruce Carrington (13-0) vs. Dana Coolwell (13-2)\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

It's more as a novelty in my view. It doesn't change the industry,\" said Pilson, president of Pilson Communications.\n\"The industry is still going to be driven by the league deals (like) MLS, NFL, Major League Baseball.\"\nAmazon Prime picked up Thursday Night Football in 2021 and MLS signed a 10-year mega-deal with Apple TV in 2022 worth a reported $2.5 billion.\nStory Continues\nMajor League Baseball signed a deal with Apple for \"Friday Night Baseball,\" a weekly doubleheader, in 2022, as well.\nLeagues have been gravitating to streaming both because it reaches a global audience, including younger viewers, who are not watching traditional television.\nMLS Commissioner Don Garber said the Apple streaming platform allows MLS to better take advantage of the sport's global fanbase.\n\"We were seeing the difficulty of getting an audience and getting the economics right with local and regional television - we saw that in 2018,\" Garber said this week at the Paley International Council Summit.\n\"We wanted to go to the market with a global package... We have a subscription that's global, every one of our 600 games is treated like 'Monday Night Football'.\"\n(Reporting by Amy Tennery in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

And while that could raise prices on everything from jeans to children\u2019s toys for everyday Americans, Trump has also floated the idea of another tariff that could impact Wall Street\u2019s current favorite trade: AI.\nDuring an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election, Trump lambasted the idea of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation Biden signed in 2022 designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. He called it \u201cso bad.\u201d\nInstead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump\u2019s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax.\nBut there\u2019s no guarantee chip builders wouldn\u2019t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities.\nSuch a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry.\n\u201cIf the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,\u201d explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThey're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.\u201d\nChip tariffs are on the table, but not a certainty\nTrump has continuously pushed the idea of tariffs as a means of targeting the US trade deficit and bringing manufacturing jobs back to America. He\u2019s already said he wants to see a 10% to 20% tax on all imported products and a 60% tax on Chinese goods.\nTariff target? TSMC produces chips for some of the world's biggest AI companies. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDuring his interview with Rogan, Trump said that instead of moving forward with the CHIPS Act, he would have put tariffs on chips coming out of Taiwan, though he didn\u2019t say how much.\nThe US has made reshoring chip manufacturing a major national security objective after the pandemic exposed the fragility of the global chip supply chain\u2014and America\u2019s reliance on other countries for advanced semiconductors.\nAccording to a 2023 US International Trade Commission working paper, 44% of US imports of logic chips \u2014 central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), etc. \u2014 came from Taiwan as of 2021. In the event of a \u201cmajor manufacturing disruption,\u201d the working paper estimated that the price of logic chips would jump as much as 59%, and US capacity would only be able to fill a portion of the gap left by the lack of Taiwanese imports.\nStory Continues\nThe CHIPS Act is supposed to increase chip manufacturing in the US and some companies are already moving to construct new facilities in the country with the promise of funding coming down the pike.\nExperts, meanwhile, are torn on whether the president-elect will move forward on such an import tax.\nFuturum Group CEO Dan Newman said that Trump\u2019s threats were likely nothing more than political posturing for election season rather than a flat-out promise that he would definitely move ahead with tariffs.\n\u201cTrump is unlikely to move forward with anything that hurts the economy because that\u2019s what he wants to be known for,\u201d Newman told Yahoo Finance.\nBut others, like Columbia Business School associate professor Lori Yue, say there\u2019s a high probability that Trump will move forward with chip tariffs.\nIf Trump does hit Taiwan-built chips with tariffs, Yue said, it will mean higher prices for Nvidia and other chip companies that get their chips from the country. But, she added, the increase in chip sales that could come as a result of deregulation related to AI under a second Trump administration might help offset those price increases.\nNewman, for his part, said that tariffs on chips out of Taiwan could eventually force chip designers to lean on Intel\u2019s (INTC) facilities in the US at a time when that company is seeking third-party chip customers.\nFor now, the chip industry, and those companies that rely on it, will have to wait and see what Trump decides to do when he takes office in January. Until then, anything is on the table.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

According to a report by news agency Reuters, the launch is part of a larger plan by the Chinese tech giant to boost its ad business. A press release from the company indicates that some AI features included in the new platform are turning text inputs into videos, generating previews that can be edited to finalize the content, remixing, digital avatar creation, as well as translation and more.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nMeanwhile, Foxconn, the Taiwan-based company that is one of the largest contract manufacturers of electronics in the world, announced that it expects robust growth in its artificial intelligence server business next year and will increase investment in several countries amid mounting trade tensions between the US and China. Per a report by Reuters, Young Liu, the chairman of the firm, said after the quarterly earnings results that his firm would be watching to see what policies Donald Trump implements as US president. He added that Foxconn plants in Wisconsin and Texas have seen steady growth in sales on strong demand for AI servers, and the outlook for US operations was positive.\nREAD ALSO: 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "whole_article": "The feverish post-election stock market rally came to a screeching halt last week.\nFor the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell more than 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed more than 500 points or nearly 1.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank over 3%.\nTwo firm inflation readings and commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell weighed on markets last week, with growing uncertainty over the Fed's rate path outweighing previous investor excitement over Trump's potential policy agenda.\nIn the week ahead, a few economic data releases are expected to add to that narrative, with activity in the services and manufacturing sector and a consumer sentiment reading headlining the schedule.\nEarnings, however, will bring attention back to some of the biggest names in the corporate world after a few weeks of macro and political events dominating investor mindshare.\nKey among these reports will be earnings from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA), which is set to report results after the bell on Wednesday. Quarterly results from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), BJ's (BJ), and Deere & Company (DE) will also be in focus.\n\u2022 USD\n(^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA pause in the rally\nSince the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, bond yields have ripped higher. The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield rose by 80 basis points between that date and the days following the election to trade near 4.5%.\nThat move in rates hadn't been an issue for the stock market rally until last week.\nWhile strategists have pointed out that a move higher in rates supported by stronger-than-expected economic growth could be welcome news for stocks, recent inflation data has thrown a wrench in that thesis.\nOn Wednesday, the \"core\" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. On Thursday, the \"core\" Producer Price Index (PPI) revealed prices increased by 3.1% over last year in October, up from 2.8% the month prior and above economist expectations for a 3% increase.\nLater on Thursday, Powell said in a speech the Fed doesn't need to be \"in a hurry\" to lower interest rates given the strength of the US economy. Markets moved lower on the comments, and the selling continued on Friday, with the Nasdaq Composite sliding more than 2.2% for the session.\n\"Slower progress on inflation in recent months may prompt the Fed to reevaluate its pace of easing moving forward,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday.\nStory Continues\nAs of Friday afternoon, investors were pricing in a 58% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by 25 basis points at its December meeting, down from the nearly 86% chance seen a month ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\nSchwab Asset Management CEO and chief investment officer Omar Aguilar told Yahoo Finance Powell's comments and the Fed debate add uncertainty and \"additional volatility and, therefore, the opportunity for investors to take something off the table and take some profits.\"\nAll eyes on Nvidia\nAmid all the macro headlines influencing the stock market in November, S&P 500 companies have posted solid third quarter earnings.\nThe S&P 500 has grown earnings by 5.4% compared to the same quarter a year prior, marking the fifth straight quarter of earnings growth, per FactSet data. And one of the index's largest contributors to that expected growth is slated to report earnings this week.\nNvidia is expected to report earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.21 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Both metrics would represent more than 80% growth compared to the same period a year prior.\n\"We expect a similar story to the last several quarters with a beat and raise in the $2B range [for current quarter revenue guidance],\" Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a research note previewing the release.\nCEO Jensen Huang speaks during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nCurtis noted that expectations have continued to \"creep higher\" as Nvidia shares have rallied more than 7% in the past month and are up more than 180% this year. But Curtis believes the stock \"continues to work\" as Nvidia continues with the release of its latest AI chip, Blackwell.\nGiven Nvidia's large weighting in the S&P 500, its earnings for the past couple of quarters have been viewed as a key catalyst for the market's overall direction.\nAnd while investors will be listening for any clues about which Big Tech companies continue to spend with the AI chip leader, the actual price action of Nvidia's stock after earnings hasn't been a barometer for broader market performance in the near term.\nFor example, Nvidia's (NVDA) August earnings release did little to impress investors and the stock fell about 6% the day after its earnings release.\nBut that sour sentiment didn't permeate through the market as the S&P 500 closed flat on that same day. This marked the second straight quarter that the broader S&P 500 didn't move with Nvidia following its earnings release.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe other side of the Trump trade\nSome of the biggest winners in the market since Donald Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 5 have reversed course.\nThe Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) has given back nearly all of its gains. The S&P 500 closed Friday below where it opened the day after the election. And the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index, which soared more than 9% following Trump's victory, has now given back about half of those gains.\nFor small caps, the story isn't much different than a week ago, when we noted Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz's concern about earnings momentum for companies in the index.\n\"In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower,\" Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery.\n\"[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet,\" Kantrowitz said. \"So something we'll be monitoring.\"\nThe move in small caps is emblematic of the uneven trading action in the two weeks following the election, as any impact from the Trump administration's policies largely remains to be seen.\n\"Key economic positions have not been announced, and we remain in a policy uncertainty backdrop,\" Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients when explaining the recent drawdown in the market rally.\n\"We are working from euphoric sentiment levels and implicit growth expectations at post-2008 highs,\" he added. \"Overall, there is a lot of pressure on macros and fundamentals to deliver, which may explain some recent profit taking after a rapid post-election run.\"\nWeekly calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: NAHB housing market index, November (42 expected, 43 previously)\nEarnings: Trip.com (TCOM)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: Housing starts month-over-month, October (-1.4% expected, -0.5% previously); Building permits, month-over-month, October (1.2% expected, -3.1% previously)\nEarnings: Lowe's (LOW), Walmart (WMT), XPeng (XPEV)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA mortgage applications, Nov. 15 (0.5% prior)\nEarnings: Nvidia (NVDA), Jack In The Box (JACK), NIO (NIO), Palo Alto Network (PANW), Snowflake (SNOW), Target (TGT), TJX (TJX), Williams-Sonoma (WSM)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending Nov. 16 (217,000 previously); Leading index, October (-0.3% expected, -0.5% previously); Existing home sales month-over-month, October (+2.3% expected, -1% previously); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity, November (-4 previously)\nEarnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG)\nFriday\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, November preliminary (48 expected, 48.5 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, November preliminary (55 expected, 55 previously); S&P Global US Composite PMI, November preliminary (54.1 previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, November final (73 expected, 73 previously)\nEarnings: No notable earnings releases.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "whole_article": "Billionaire Tom Steyer cares about politics.\nHe ran for president in 2020 on a climate-friendly agenda, which was followed by his opponents in the Democratic primary solidifying their climate proposals. Since then, he\u2019s founded Galvanize Climate Solutions, an investment firm focused on climate impact, which former Secretary of State John Kerry recently joined as co-executive chair.\nGiven that context, you\u2019d think Steyer would be nervous about the next four years with the election of Donald Trump, who is likely to exit the Paris Climate Agreement again.\nBut in an interview at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference, Steyer stated, \u201cTo a very large extent, it doesn't matter\u201d who is in the White House. As he sees it, climate solutions will win in the free market.\nSteyer pointed to the energy transition that\u2019s already taking place in \u201cdeep red states\u201d across the country. Texas, for instance, is the biggest wind energy producer in the United States despite state legislation that excludes wind projects from tax breaks and favors fossil fuels.\n\"Why are they doing that? Because of the money,\" Steyer said. \"This is business. This is economics. Nobody gets to get away from the rules of markets and prices.\"\nSteyer's comments mirror Apollo (APO) CEO Marc Rowan\u2019s view that the US needs to get on board with the energy transition or it risks getting left behind, which is part of why Rowan is \u201cincredibly optimistic\u201d about four more years under Trump. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\n\"Those countries that build power, that support data, that support advanced data, advanced AI, advanced power are going to win,\" Rowan said. \"Those that don't are going to be left behind. This is going to be table stakes.\u201d\nInnovation fueling change in government is part of the thesis behind Steyer\u2019s latest book, \"Cheaper, Faster, Better.\" In the book, the billionaire argues that consumer demand for climate-related innovations, which are often cheaper as well, will drive adoption.\nOne example is electric vehicles. Kelley Blue Book reported that EVs now make up about 9% of the car market in the US, nearing a critical 10% adoption threshold. The falling cost of EV ownership has contributed to this trend.\nSince this data came out, however, the incoming Trump administration announced it plans to roll back EV tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, which could reverse this trend.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer speaks at \"Our Rights, Our Courts\" forum New Hampshire Technical Institute's Concord Community College, Saturday, Feb. 8, 2020, in Concord, N.H. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe next wave of climate investments\nFor investors who want high impact and high returns, Steyer said to stick with the fundamentals.\nStory Continues\n\u201cPeople think that the breakthroughs in the technologies are going be gadgets ... electric vehicles, batteries, things you can touch,\" Steyer said. \"I think there's going be a whole other part of this economy absolutely relevant to climate where returns are going to be really good.\"\nSome areas of investment Steyer is bullish on include real estate, credit, carbon sequestration, and agriculture. Steyer's firm has a real estate fund that focuses on optimizing properties for energy efficiency savings to increase the underlying property value, which fits Steyer\u2019s interest in investments that can solve problems in the next decade rather than over the long term.\nOne such solution that\u2019s getting a lot of attention and investment in the tech world is nuclear energy, with Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG) all pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the space.\nRead what top decision-makers are saying at Yahoo Finance's Invest event:\nBillionaire Tom Steyer: Trump presidency won\u2019t hold back the energy transition\nAnduril CEO sees opportunity for defense tech startups under Trump\nHow Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could affect the cost of jeans, appliances, and everyday items\nBut Steyer doesn\u2019t see a bull case there yet.\n\u201cJust being part of the energy transition doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good investment,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou\u2019d have to be awfully aggressive\u201d to see nuclear fusion energy scale in the next decade. Even nuclear fission, the form of nuclear energy deployed in power plants today, has risks that should be evaluated closely.\nThe success of longer-term bets like nuclear energy may depend on investments from Big Tech, which has been willing to take on riskier investments, since the future of its business depends on energy usage.\n\u201cMicrosoft is definitely really serious about their responsibilities in terms of emissions and climate,\" Steyer said. \"So they're willing to go and try something that's difficult to do and maybe controversial to do.\u201d\nRegardless of which climate solution wins or who sits in the Oval Office, Steyer believes the momentum toward solving the climate crisis is clear.\n\u201cIn my mind, from the standpoint as an American, I would like to see us continue to be a world leader, both from a business standpoint, an economic standpoint, and also a value standpoint,\u201d he said.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

Under FTC Chair Lina Khan\u2019s leadership, regulators aggressively pursued cases against the industry\u2019s biggest companies, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\nTrump, on the other hand, has promised to cut excess red tape, including his promise to throw out Biden\u2019s executive order aimed at putting safety guardrails on AI \u2014 a move that would be viewed as controversial by those within the industry.\nWhile Trump\u2019s antitrust agendas remain uncertain, there seems to be growing optimism that he'll employ a more hands-off approach compared to Biden.\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to rally further into year-end as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump with Khan/FTC days in the rear view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCisco (CSCO) CFO Scott Herren is confident in the company\u2019s momentum heading into 2025.

Performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks, outside of Tesla (TSLA), has been lackluster since Election Day, hampered by risks associated with a stronger dollar and more tariffs.\nStory Continues\nCheck out what top decision-makers said at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference:\nBillionaire Tom Steyer: Trump presidency won\u2019t hold back the energy transition\nAnduril CEO sees opportunity for defense tech startups under Trump\nHow Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could affect the cost of jeans, appliances, and everyday items\nThat could change quickly, Defiance ETFs CEO Sylvia Jablonski told me.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\nAlphabet's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Alphabet managed to grow EPS by 14% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Alphabet shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 27% to 32%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nNasdaqGS:GOOGL Earnings and Revenue History November 17th 2024\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Alphabet's future profits.\nAre Alphabet Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nSince Alphabet has a market capitalisation of US$2.1t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$221b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\nIt means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Alphabet, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.\nStory Continues\nAlphabet offered total compensation worth US$8.8m to its CEO in the year to December 2023. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\nIs Alphabet Worth Keeping An Eye On?\nOne positive for Alphabet is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Alphabet, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Alphabet is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "whole_article": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 The U.S. antitrust watchdogs that pounced on Big Tech and deterred corporate deal making throughout President Joe Biden's administration may be kept on a shorter leash by Donald Trump after he returns to the White House next year.\nAlthough regulators began cracking down on tech powerhouses such as Google and Facebook during Trump's first term as president, most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to mergers and deal-making after years of hypervigilance under Biden's watch.\nOne of the biggest reasons underlying the anticipated pivot stems from the widespread belief that the chief architects of the Biden administration's get-tougher stance \u2014 Lina Khan of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's Jonathan Kanter \u2014 won't be part of the Trump regime.\nBoth the Justice Department and FTC didn't respond to request for comment.\nTrump's announcement of billionaire Elon Musk, who once anointed himself as \u201cTechnoking,\u201d to oversee an advisory effort focused on slashing government spending could end up reducing the staffs and regulators trying to rein in deep-pocketed companies.\nAnd Trump's nomination of combative supporter Matt Gaetz to be U.S. Attorney General has thrown even more uncertainty into the game. Gaetz has previously lashed out at social media platforms' policies he claims suppress conservative views, and has, at times, joined in on calls to break up Big Tech. He also has a track record of supporting causes trumpeted by Trump.\n\u201cThere are going to be some profound changes\" in antitrust policies, predicts John Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University that has periodically worked on antitrust issues with the FTC and Justice Department. \u201cElon Musk could end up having a larger-than-life influence on policy, and that isn't something we have seen before, where a single person whispers in the ear of the President.\"\nOther experts interviewed by The Associated Press mostly agree with Kwoka's sentiments. But they also believe it's highly unlikely the anticipated shift will result in regulators abandoning existing antitrust cases against Big Tech firms, partly because those legal showdowns coalesce with populist worries about the industry's increasing power and influence on people's lives.\n\u201cWe are in uncharted territory, but the idea of going up against Big Tech still has legs to it,\u201d said Rebecca Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who tracks antitrust issues.\nStory Continues\nBut the changing of the guard may open a door for Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook to avert prolonged court battles and negotiate settlements under a president that relishes in deal making.\n\u201cMaybe Big Tech should buy a copy of \u2018The Art of The Deal\u2019 to figure out how to best negotiate with this administration,\u201d suggested Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if they find ways to reach some accommodations and we end up seeing more negotiated resolutions and consent decrees.\u201d\nWhile the fate of existing antitrust cases remains in a realm of pure speculation, almost everyone is betting the Trump administration will be more receptive to mergers that typically come with a promise of lower costs and other benefits for consumers.\nThe stage is set for \u201ca golden era for deal flow among public and private tech players over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note after Trump's reelection.\nIt's a belief widely shared by most investors, which helped fuel a run up in the overall stock market since Election Day and boosted shares in companies trying to close deals announced during the Biden administration. One such example involves Capital One Financial and Discover, who aim to consummate their merger in a stock swap next year. Capital One's market value has increased by 11% while Discover's market value has climbed 16%.\nThe change in administration could also sway a proposed merger between the country's two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. But the FTC filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. But the two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.\nGiven grocery prices remain a hot-button issue among consumers still feeling shell shocked from post-pandemic inflationary spikes, Allensworth believes the Trump administration is less likely to \u201cabandon or soft pedal\" the FTC's challenge to the Kroger-Albertsons merger.\nIn another case that has been cheered by hordes of consumers, the Justice Department is seeking to break up Ticketmaster and its corporate parent Live Nation in a lawsuit claiming their practices are driving up the cost of concerts and other entertainment.\nDespite the grassroots support for that case, Live Nation executives are signaling they think they can preserve the current system under a Trump presidency.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that we\u2019ll see a return to the more traditional antitrust approach, where the agencies have generally tried to find ways to solve problems they see with targeted remedies that minimize government intervention in the marketplace,\u201d Live Nation President Joe Berchtold said during a conference call with investors shortly after the election.\nDeals that got torpedoed by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command. American and JetBlue are already considering resurrecting a partnership after an earlier proposal got torpedoed by a legal challenge by Biden's antitrust team \u2014 a decision that was recently upheld by a Boston appeals court.\n\u201cWe are still taking a look at it,\u201d American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said shortly after the election. \u201cWe will take everything that the court has fed back, and we\u2019ll put that into consideration.\"\nSimilar conversations are likely taking place among other executives re-examining deals that seemed off-limits during the Biden administration, said Colin Kass, an antitrust attorney at the law firm Proskauer Rose,\n\u201cIt's almost certain there were deals that people put the brakes on because of antitrust concerns and those will be revisited to decide whether they still make economic sense,\u201d Kass said. \u201cIf so, they will present it to the DOJ. And if there needs to be a fix, it\u2019s more likely to get fixed than blocked outright. So it\u2019s worth taking a chance at getting these deals done.\u201d\nAs for the efforts to dismantle Big Tech monopolies, the first case brought by the Trump administration against Google is now in the hands of a federal judge who ruled in August that the company's dominant search engine is an illegal monopoly. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C. is now weighing what kind of punishment to impose on Google. A decision is expected by August next year.\nIn a preliminary proposal filed last month, the Justice Department indicated it might try to persuade Mehta to order that key parts of Google be broken up to restore competition.\nThe Justice Department's final draft of recommended penalties is due this Wednesday. The filing isn't likely to be influenced by the specter of the Trump administration taking over next January as Kanter and the rest of the team he assembled at Justice get one final chance to state their case against Google, said David Olson, an associate law professor for Boston College.\nA reshuffled team of antitrust regulators appointed by Trump could still backtrack from whatever position is staked out in the Nov. 20 filing and take a different stance when Mehta presides over the hearings about the proposed punishments next spring.\n\u201cIt is disheartening to see,\u201d Kwoka said. \u201cA tougher policy was in order because the tech companies in particular had been allowed to behave without any significant restraint for 20 years. And then we all recognized it was going to take more than four years to establish a tougher policy and show its merits. Now, that may not happen.\u201d\n___\nAP Business Writer Dee-Ann Durbin and AP Business Writer Dave Koenig contributed to this story.\nView Comments"

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Predictive Analytics Stock to Invest in Now?\nA team of actuaries and engineers at a computer looking at the data and finding the best reinsurance solution for a client.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nAnalyst upside as of November 11, 2024: 16%\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that ranks fifth on our list of the best predictive analytics stocks to invest in. It owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo.\nThe company is a pioneer in data analytics and has been making use of predictive metrics in Google Analytics for years now. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers a range of solutions where predictive analytics comes into play. For example, its data science solution consists of a complete suite of data management, analytics, and machine learning tools that help entities garner insights from data and generate value. In addition to that, its marketing analytics solution helps companies significantly improve the overall customer journey and experience using crucial insights from existing data.\nBusinesses can use the myriad of tools available at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to simply develop machine-learning models that are able to recognize and identify patterns in datasets and provide crucial insights to entities.

Analysts also favor the stock and their median price target implies an upside of 16% from current levels, as of November 11.\nPolen Capital\u00a0Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon were also top absolute detractors. Alphabet\u2019s better-than-expected results were overshadowed by an adverse ruling related to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (\u201cDoJ\u201d) anti-trust case against the company. We expected an adverse ruling and are monitoring potential remedies recommended by the DoJ and subsequently ruled on by the judge. This will likely take a few years to play out; in the meantime, we see many mitigating factors that the company can pursue to protect its competitive position and growth. We trimmed our positions in Alphabet and Microsoft by 1.5% each to fund the purchase of Oracle. They both remain top five holdings at the new weights.\u201d\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 5th on our list of best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks on latest ratings and news.\nAI data centers and the power needed to keep them running are some of the hottest topics in the technology space. A new report by management consulting firm Gartner sheds expert light on the matter, AI and GenAI are driving rapid increases in electricity consumption, with data center forecasts over the next two years reaching as high as 160% growth. Gartner claims that 40% of existing AI data centers will be operationally constrained by power availability by 2027. Research from the company indicates that the power required for data centers to run incremental AI-optimized servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year in 2027, which is 2.6 times the level in 2023.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nBob Johnson, VP Analyst at Gartner, has said that the explosive growth of new hyperscale data centers to implement GenAI is creating an insatiable demand for power that will exceed the ability of utility providers to expand their capacity fast enough. In turn, per Johnson, this threatens to disrupt energy availability and lead to shortages, which will limit the growth of new data centers for GenAI and other uses from 2026. He added that short-term power shortages are likely to continue for years as new power transmission, distribution and generation capacity could take years to come online and won\u2019t alleviate current problems.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "whole_article": "The re-election of Donald Trump infused record highs in technology and cryptocurrency markets, with the artificial intelligence chip giant NVIDIA NVDA and Bitcoin cryptocurrency seeing remarkable surges. Similarly, the Tesla TSLA stock soared due to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s all-in support for Trump.\nOverall, the technology industry is preparing for potential shifts in policy as Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. His administration is expected to address issues like antitrust, AI regulation, and the CHIPS Act, with major implications for Big Tech.\nAntitrust Regulation: Shift Away From Biden's Approach?\nUnder the Biden administration, antitrust measures targeted big players like Google, Amazon, and Apple, with the FTC attempting to curb their market dominance. Trump, however, has indicated a more lenient stance on breaking up Big Tech. This could affect ongoing cases against Big Tech, including efforts to break up Alphabet\u2019s Google GOOGL due to its dominance in online search.\nWhile Trump is likely to continue several antitrust cases against major tech companies \u2014 many of which began during his first term \u2014 he recently expressed skepticism about a potential Google breakup. In October, Trump questioned whether dismantling Google would harm the company too severely.\nA Boon for Artificial Intelligence?\nGenerative AI has surged in relevance since Trump\u2019s first term. The Trump administration had previously made concerted efforts in promoting artificial intelligence (AI). He signed the American AI Initiative executive order on Feb. 11, 2019. The order pledged to double AI research investment and established the first set of national AI research institutes.\nThe order also included a plan for AI technical standards and established guidance for the federal government\u2019s use of AI. Trump also signed an executive order on Dec. 3, 2020, promoting the use of trustworthy AI in the federal government. It shows that AI stocks and ETFs should have great days during Trump\u2019s ruling (read: 4 Sector ETFs to Gain on Trump's Triumph).\nTech companies are increasingly calling for standardized regulation to avoid a confusing patchwork of state rules. The Biden administration\u2019s recent executive order sought to balance AI growth with safety measures. In contrast, Trump\u2019s deregulation tendencies could mean fewer restrictions on AI development. However, Elon Musk, who expressed concerns about unchecked AI growth, may encourage Trump to consider some form of flexible regulation.\nThe CHIPS Act and Potential Tariffs\nBiden\u2019s CHIPS Act, which provides $52.7 billion for domestic semiconductor production, may face scrutiny. Though Trump is unlikely to repeal it, he might streamline funding and reduce regulatory hurdles. However, he\u2019s also suggested imposing tariffs on imported chips to spur domestic production, a move that could increase the cost of goods with imported chips and impact various tech products, from consumer electronics to enterprise AI hardware.\nStory Continues\nAny Threats for Big Techs?\nConsistent Antitrust Enforcement Expected\nWhile Trump may revise some policies, a full-blown reduction in antitrust enforcement is not likely. Note that the Trump administration brought a comparable number of merger cases to the Biden administration during his first term, according to an analysis by the Sheppard Mullin law firm, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nChina Plays a Crucial Role in Big Tech\u2019s Fortune\nTrump\u2019s first term is famous for slapping tariffs on China. He\u2019s threatened to slap China with 60-100% tariffs on goods, so the risk of a global trade war looms. Any trade war with China is a negative for big techs. Apple and Tesla, especially, depend a lot on the Chinese market and supply chains. Apple\u2019s manufacturing relies heavily on Chinese facilities, while Tesla considers China as one of its fastest-growing markets.\nTech ETFs in Focus\nIn a nutshell, the scenario is mixed-to-bullish for big tech stocks. Investors may continue to play top-ranked technology-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH, First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY, iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF IGM and First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF FDN. All these tech ETFs hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (see all technology ETFs here).\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As the initial euphoria of market participants is over, investors are assessing the pros and cons of Trump\u2019s economic policies, such as the imposition of tariffs, reduction of corporate taxes, deregulation of corporate America and their impact on inflation.\nThe technology sector is also concerned about Trump\u2019s tariffs on high-end chipsets, the future of the $52.5 billion Chips and Science Act and the imposition of antitrust regulations on big techs. Nevertheless, I believe that the AI frenzy will continue as this technology has become the need of the hour.\nAt this stage, we recommend five generative artificial intelligence (AI) behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank that have double-digit upside potential in the short term. These are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc.

Sales in its next generation product segment rose 26%.\nRead more: Rachel Reeves hints at looser regulation in bid to improve UK's competitiveness\n\"Imperial will be looking to a similar recipe in the year to September 2024, for which chief executive Stefan Bomhard gave clear guidance alongside the full-year results for 2023 back in November,\" said Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth.\nIn its half-year results, Imperial Brands said it expected to deliver revenue growth in the low-single digits on a constant currency basis for its tobacco and next generation products segments.\nThe company forecast that adjusted operating profit would grow by close to the middle of its mid-single digit range.\nOn the back of this guidance, AJ Bell's investment experts said that analysts were expecting group adjusted operating profit of \u00a33.9bn, which would be flat on the previous year.\nAnalysts were also said to be expecting adjusted earnings per share of \u00a32.95, up from \u00a32.79 last year.\nIn terms of its dividend, Imperial Brands has produced three consecutive increases in the payout, with analysts said to be looking for another advance to \u00a31.53 per share in this set of results. The company also recently announced a further share buyback of \u00a31.25bn, which it is set to complete by the end of October 2025.\n\u2022 USD\n(IMB.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nJD Sports (JD.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter trading update on Thursday 21 November\nSportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) had a tougher start to its fiscal year but Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the situation has since picked up for the business. However, shares in the company are still down nearly 29% year-to-date.\nIn its interim results, JD Sports logged 5% growth in revenue to \u00a35.03bn, while profit before tax and adjusting items was up 2% to \u00a3405.6m.\n\"It was pleasing to see Europe, North America and Asia Pacific markets all posting double-digit sales growth,\" said Chiekrie. \"But the UK market remains challenging and volatile, and full-year profit guidance got a small downgrade as a result.\"\nHe said that JD Sports was trying to offset these challenges by \"tightening its belt and streamlining operations\".\nRead more: December UK interest rate cut unlikely despite GDP slowdown\n\"Investors will be hoping that means there won\u2019t be further downgrades to the full-year outlook in next week's results,\" he said.\nChiekrie said that investors would also be wanting to see how its takeover of US sporting goods supplier Hibbett is progressing, having completed the acquisition in July.\n\"The deal has substantially increased the group\u2019s footprint in the US, but there\u2019s a lot of work to do to make sure a deal of this size pulls in the expected benefits,\" he said.\nIn terms of its UK business, Andy Higginson, who is both chair of JD Sports and the British Retail Consortium, recently warned that tax rises on businesses announced in the autumn budget would result in prices to rise for shoppers.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the budget that employers would have to pay 15% in national insurance on salaries over \u00a35,000, rising from the current rate of 13.8% on salaries over \u00a39,100.\n\"I'm guaranteeing you today, if these go through as they are without any sort of feathering, we\u2019re going to see significant inflation in prices,\" Higginson said on the BBC's Today programme.\n\u2022 USD\n(JD.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nInternational Distribution Services (IDS.L) \u2014 Reports interim results on Thursday 21 November\nThe focus for investors in Royal Mail-owner International Distribution Services will be on the takeover of the company led by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.\nIDS agreed to the \u00a33.57bn takeover offer back in May, with the offer made through a special purpose vehicle, EP UK Bidco Limited, owned by J&T Capital Partners and EP Corporate Group.

        "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnder Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities\nNYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January\nZimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End\nIn Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift\nSaudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace\nThere\u2019s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump\u2019s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.\nBut there\u2019s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate \u2014 especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect \u2014 and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.\nThese cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk\u2019s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up less than 1%, while Facebook parent Meta is down 0.6%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 3.5%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 2%.\nAs the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they\u2019re thinking about. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying:\nTiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:\n\u201cTariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.\nWe have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.\u201d\nMark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we\u2019ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.\nI don\u2019t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.\u201d\nMark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.\n\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she\u2019s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.\u201d\nThreats against Alphabet and Meta are \u201cjust talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn\u2019t take kindly to that. However, I don\u2019t think anything like this will make it into policy.\u201d\nKevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management\n\u201cTrump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn\u2019t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn\u2019t put him the best light.\nThe thing that\u2019s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That\u2019s a counter perspective to that. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren\u2019t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.\nI don\u2019t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined. I have exposure to Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple. I don\u2019t know how tariffs will impact Nvidia, since the demand will remain there no matter what. Broadcom goes kind of hand in hand with that. I think that at Apple, Cook will take steps to keep the products from exploding in price.\u201d\nAdam Grossman, chief investment officer of global equity at Riverfront Investment Group:\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unclear a week after the election. I do think he could get tariffs through on China, but getting tariffs through on Europe, that\u2019s another ball of wax.\nFor someone like Donald Trump, I think he\u2019s going to have enough other issues that they\u2019re going to kind of fly off of his radar.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nChinese tech conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering an offering of bonds totaling the equivalent of about $5 billion as soon as this month, people familiar with the matter said.\nElon Musk\u2019s social media platform X sued to block a California law aimed at curbing AI-generated deceptive election content on social media, claiming the measure is an unconstitutional affront to free speech.\nMeta Platforms Inc. said it intends to appeal court rulings allowing dozens of states and hundreds of school districts across the US to proceed with lawsuits blaming \u201caddictive\u201d social media apps for contributing to a mental health crisis among youths.\nSamsung Electronics Co. plans to buy back about 10 trillion won ($7.2 billion) of its own stock over the next year, putting in motion one of the larger shareholder return programs in its history.\nLenovo Group Ltd. hiked its projection for global PC shipments in 2025 after posting better-than-expected earnings, saying AI features will help boost growth next year.\nEarnings Due Friday\nPremarket\nAlibaba\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nCEOs Brace for the Chaos of Another Four Years of Trump\nElon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\u2019s Government\nBetting on Tesla Helped Ron Baron Beat the Index.

        "whole_article": "Billionaire Tom Steyer cares about politics.\nHe ran for president in 2020 on a climate-friendly agenda, which was followed by his opponents in the Democratic primary solidifying their climate proposals. Since then, he\u2019s founded Galvanize Climate Solutions, an investment firm focused on climate impact, which former Secretary of State John Kerry recently joined as co-executive chair.\nGiven that context, you\u2019d think Steyer would be nervous about the next four years with the election of Donald Trump, who is likely to exit the Paris Climate Agreement again.\nBut in an interview at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference, Steyer stated, \u201cTo a very large extent, it doesn't matter\u201d who is in the White House. As he sees it, climate solutions will win in the free market.\nSteyer pointed to the energy transition that\u2019s already taking place in \u201cdeep red states\u201d across the country. Texas, for instance, is the biggest wind energy producer in the United States despite state legislation that excludes wind projects from tax breaks and favors fossil fuels.\n\"Why are they doing that? Because of the money,\" Steyer said. \"This is business. This is economics. Nobody gets to get away from the rules of markets and prices.\"\nSteyer's comments mirror Apollo (APO) CEO Marc Rowan\u2019s view that the US needs to get on board with the energy transition or it risks getting left behind, which is part of why Rowan is \u201cincredibly optimistic\u201d about four more years under Trump. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\n\"Those countries that build power, that support data, that support advanced data, advanced AI, advanced power are going to win,\" Rowan said. \"Those that don't are going to be left behind. This is going to be table stakes.\u201d\nInnovation fueling change in government is part of the thesis behind Steyer\u2019s latest book, \"Cheaper, Faster, Better.\" In the book, the billionaire argues that consumer demand for climate-related innovations, which are often cheaper as well, will drive adoption.\nOne example is electric vehicles. Kelley Blue Book reported that EVs now make up about 9% of the car market in the US, nearing a critical 10% adoption threshold. The falling cost of EV ownership has contributed to this trend.\nSince this data came out, however, the incoming Trump administration announced it plans to roll back EV tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, which could reverse this trend.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer speaks at \"Our Rights, Our Courts\" forum New Hampshire Technical Institute's Concord Community College, Saturday, Feb. 8, 2020, in Concord, N.H. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe next wave of climate investments\nFor investors who want high impact and high returns, Steyer said to stick with the fundamentals.\nStory Continues\n\u201cPeople think that the breakthroughs in the technologies are going be gadgets ... electric vehicles, batteries, things you can touch,\" Steyer said. \"I think there's going be a whole other part of this economy absolutely relevant to climate where returns are going to be really good.\"\nSome areas of investment Steyer is bullish on include real estate, credit, carbon sequestration, and agriculture. Steyer's firm has a real estate fund that focuses on optimizing properties for energy efficiency savings to increase the underlying property value, which fits Steyer\u2019s interest in investments that can solve problems in the next decade rather than over the long term.\nOne such solution that\u2019s getting a lot of attention and investment in the tech world is nuclear energy, with Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG) all pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the space.\nRead what top decision-makers are saying at Yahoo Finance's Invest event:\nBillionaire Tom Steyer: Trump presidency won\u2019t hold back the energy transition\nAnduril CEO sees opportunity for defense tech startups under Trump\nHow Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could affect the cost of jeans, appliances, and everyday items\nBut Steyer doesn\u2019t see a bull case there yet.\n\u201cJust being part of the energy transition doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good investment,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou\u2019d have to be awfully aggressive\u201d to see nuclear fusion energy scale in the next decade. Even nuclear fission, the form of nuclear energy deployed in power plants today, has risks that should be evaluated closely.\nThe success of longer-term bets like nuclear energy may depend on investments from Big Tech, which has been willing to take on riskier investments, since the future of its business depends on energy usage.\n\u201cMicrosoft is definitely really serious about their responsibilities in terms of emissions and climate,\" Steyer said. \"So they're willing to go and try something that's difficult to do and maybe controversial to do.\u201d\nRegardless of which climate solution wins or who sits in the Oval Office, Steyer believes the momentum toward solving the climate crisis is clear.\n\u201cIn my mind, from the standpoint as an American, I would like to see us continue to be a world leader, both from a business standpoint, an economic standpoint, and also a value standpoint,\u201d he said.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Microsoft is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.28 = US$113b \u00f7 (US$523b - US$115b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThus, Microsoft has an ROCE of 28%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.8% earned by companies in a similar industry.\nSee our latest analysis for Microsoft\nNasdaqGS:MSFT Return on Capital Employed November 17th 2024\nIn the above chart we have measured Microsoft's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Microsoft .\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\nMicrosoft is displaying some positive trends. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 28%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 85%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\nThe Key Takeaway\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that Microsoft is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 189% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\nIf you want to continue researching Microsoft, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.\nMicrosoft is not the only stock earning high returns.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nData is at the forefront of many inventions today and is the primary ingredient of innovation. Of the many branches of data usage, predictive analytics is garnering immense traction, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistics, modeling, and machine learning to forecast, predict, and plan future events. There are different types of predictive analytics including regression analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics market was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023. The global predictive analytics market is expected to grow to $95.3 billion by 2032 from $18.02 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%. The report attributes the growth in the industry to the growing investments in data by the government and large corporations followed by IoT and AI integrations. The use of predictive analytics is bifurcated into multiple segments including life sciences, automotive, retail, energy, telecom, and healthcare, to name a few.\nStartups Disrupting the Predictive Analytics Space\nThere are a range of startups in the predictive analytics space that are revolutionizing the industry. One such name is Pecan AI. The automated predictive analytics platform is developed and designed intricately to meet the needs of data scientists. Data scientists can use the platform to build powerful predictive AI capabilities and machine learning models that drive business impact. Data scientists do not need coding or data science skills to make use of the platform. The platform is used by a range of companies including Johnson & Johnson, SciPlay, Hydrant, Kenvue, Proper Cloth, and DME Acquire. Earlier in January, the company introduced predictive generative AI to transform enterprises. Pecan AI also has partnerships with some of the largest tech corporations and platforms including Azure and AWS.\nDataRobot is another leader in the predictive analytics industry that delivers revolutionary AI use cases for businesses. Its AI platform consists of core AI features such as generative AI, predictive AI, AI governance, AI observability, and AI foundation. The platform promises 83% faster deployment and secures nearly 1.4 billion predictions every day. Users can run models in minutes by skipping manual data preparation and cleaning.

Users can connect data from warehouses such as AWS and Azure into a singular workspace. Some of the predictive use cases facilitated by DataRobot include time series modeling, clustering and seasonality, cold start forecasting, nowcasting, and anomaly detection.\nStory Continues\nNow that we have studied the predictive analytics industry and some revolutionary startups, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now we went through multiple reports on the internet, ETFs, and stock screeners. We then examined the analyst upside of each stock and ranked the ones with the highest percentage. Our list is in ascending order of the analyst upside as of November 11, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

As the company ventures into new technologies and AI, it does represent a breakthrough stock that can influence the future.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pioneering predictive analytics and we say that because of its strong data and machine learning capabilities. Azure Synapse Analytics is an analytics service that provides enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics. The platform can be run either serverless or with dedicated resources, giving users extended autonomy over their data use cases. Users can generate insights across data warehouses and big data systems. In addition to that, the platform also offers technologies for big data, log and time series analytics, data integration, and deep integration with other Azure services namely Power BI and AzureML.\nThe company is increasingly making use of artificial intelligence to unlock real-time insights. On May 21, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that users can now access real-time insights with AI-powered analytics in Microsoft Fabric, the company\u2019s new unified data analytics platform.

A new report by management consulting firm Gartner sheds expert light on the matter, AI and GenAI are driving rapid increases in electricity consumption, with data center forecasts over the next two years reaching as high as 160% growth. Gartner claims that 40% of existing AI data centers will be operationally constrained by power availability by 2027. Research from the company indicates that the power required for data centers to run incremental AI-optimized servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year in 2027, which is 2.6 times the level in 2023.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nBob Johnson, VP Analyst at Gartner, has said that the explosive growth of new hyperscale data centers to implement GenAI is creating an insatiable demand for power that will exceed the ability of utility providers to expand their capacity fast enough. In turn, per Johnson, this threatens to disrupt energy availability and lead to shortages, which will limit the growth of new data centers for GenAI and other uses from 2026. He added that short-term power shortages are likely to continue for years as new power transmission, distribution and generation capacity could take years to come online and won\u2019t alleviate current problems.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Whereas, the full vision of the metaverse encompasses platforms and devices that work seamlessly with each other, the possibility for thousands of people to interact simultaneously, and use cases well beyond gaming. While the phenomenon gained attention in 2021 with internet searches for the term increasing by 7,200%, it seems here to stay. With lockdowns and work-from-home policies in place, the interest in shared virtual environments spiked. The opportunity remains vast with metaverse having the potential to generate up to $5 trillion in value by 2030.\nIs the Metaverse Still Alive?\nWhen the tech guru Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook\u2019s name to Meta in 2021, he clearly drove the metaverse narrative in the world. Although the vision of a digital future of work and recreation became a buzz for a while, other emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence decided to dominate the headlines later.\nQuestions regarding whether Zuckerberg should have transformed a successful social media company into a VR venture have also been asked. In September 2023, BBC reported that his company\u2019s virtual and augmented reality branch, Reality Labs, has lost $21 billion since the prior year. The firm later introduced its social virtual reality space Horizon Worlds. While some users have complained about not having enough people to make it fun, the platform\u2019s monthly users can simply not match the number of people who consume social media like Facebook and Instagram every day.\nAlthough the company\u2019s virtual reality headset and its Horizon Worlds have not gone mainstream after 3 years of the company\u2019s founding, experts argue that the metaverse is still as relevant as ever. On October 2, CNBC reported that Zuckerberg\u2019s metaverse is finally showing signs of life as his company might have found its footing in VR and AR through a different medium, smart glasses. After the firm witnessed early success in the market for smart glasses via a partnership with Ray-Ban, the CEO unveiled the first \u201cfully-functioning\u201d prototype AR glasses, Orion, in September.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe right way to look at Orion is as a time machine. These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\u201d\nAlthough there might be a lack of connection between the metaverse which was the next big thing two years ago and the prevailing tech landscape dominated by AI, some argue that the reports of the metaverse\u2019s death are \u2018exaggerated\u2019 and that it is a rather long-term concept to materialize as a digital future for masses.\nWith that being said, let\u2019s move to the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders:\u00a0279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) empowers people and organizations to achieve more with technology. It has segments namely Productivity and Business Processes, \u00a0Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The company is best known for its software products but it has a solid presence in other emerging domains.\nMicrosoft was one of the first in the metaverse race with its HoloLens mixed reality headset. While the firm is no longer producing its HoloLens 2 headset, it still remains in the race. Microsoft decided to make a metaverse inside Teams through Microsoft Mesh which powers 3D immersive experiences using next-generation technology that makes virtual connections seem like face-to-face interactions.\nWhile Mesh was available on PC and Meta Quest VR devices, it was announced to be generally available in Microsoft Teams in January 2024. Previously, the Mesh avatars opened the doors of workplace metaverse in Teams. Customers including Accenture, BP, and Mercy Ships are reaping the benefits of Mesh already. Additionally, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, a leader in game development and interactive entertainment content publisher. This move was seen by the company as a step towards growth in its gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud while providing building blocks for the metaverse.\nFor the FY25 Q1, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recorded revenue of $65.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year. The firm witnessed a solid start to its fiscal year, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue. Revenue in Productivity and Business Processes was up 12%, revenue in Intelligent Cloud increased 20%, and revenue in More Personal Computing rose 17%, year-over-year. Simultaneously, the firm\u2019s AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter.\nWhile the hardware aspect of Microsoft\u2019s presence in the metaverse might fade with the discontinuation of HoloLens 2, its expertise in gaming and the cloud is proven and is expected to foster the firm\u2019s foothold in the metaverse. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the 10 best metaverse stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The stock is held by 279 hedge funds, as of 2024\u2019s second quarter.\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the other Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

However, when asked about his relationship with Gates in a rare joint interview, Jobs didn\u2019t respond with competitiveness or rivalry \u2013 instead, he quoted a line from a Beatles song.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date.\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nDuring the 2007 interview, Jobs and Gates reminisced about their long history in the industry. They laughed, remembering their early years when they were frequently the youngest in the room. Gates noted how it was always wonderful to see someone like Jobs persevere through the many challenges and trends offered by the rapidly changing computer sector.\nJobs, known for his passion for music, quoted The Beatles' reflective line: \"You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead,\u201d before adding, \u201cAnd that\u2019s clearly true here.\u201d\n\n\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nThe lyric from The Beatles' \"Two of Us\" song perfectly captured the sentiment. For all their competition, Jobs and Gates shared a deep mutual respect. The song is about friendship, shared memories and a sense of journey \u2013 and that's exactly how Jobs saw his connection with Gates. After all, they'd both been through the ups and downs of building billion-dollar companies, watching trends come and go and surviving the intense pressures of leading groundbreaking tech firms.\nStory Continues\nIt was a moment that showed the softer side of their relationship and that despite being rivals, Jobs and Gates weren't just competing tech CEOs \u2013 they were two individuals who'd shared a unique journey in an industry they helped to shape. Their antagonism had subsided into camaraderie based on mutual knowledge of what it required to get to where they were, shared experiences and the rare act of cooperation.\nSee Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\nBack in the late '70s and early '80s, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was working hard to get its personal computers into homes, schools and offices, aiming to make computers friendly, accessible and even stylish. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), on the other hand, was all about software under Gates\u2019 direction. Gates aimed to install Microsoft\u2019s operating system on as many machines as possible, including IBM, Apple\u2019s main rival. And a long-standing rivalry was sparked by this action.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system, introduced in 1983, was strikingly similar to Apple's Mac OS and Jobs was not happy about it. He famously accused Gates of copying Apple\u2019s interface, saying that Microsoft had no shame in borrowing ideas.\nUltimately, this brief Beatles reference from Jobs was a reminder of the humanity behind the industry giants. For those who grew up with either an Apple device or Microsoft software \u2013 most of us have used both \u2013 their partnership and rivalry have always felt like a part of our own experience with technology.\nRead Next:\nWith over 7.8K investors including Meta, Google, And Amazon Execs \u2014 this AI Startup's valuation has skyrocketed from $5 million to $85 million in just three years.

The recent rise in its shares pushed Nvidia to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.6tn (\u00a32.8tn).\nShares rose earlier this week after Nvidia said that Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) would be the first to receive its AI Blackwell chips.\nThis came as part of a series of collaborations with SoftBank that Nvidia announced on Tuesday.\nRead more: How Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote speech at the chipmaker's AI Summit in Japan, that SoftBank would be using its Blackwell platform to build Japan's most powerful AI supercomputer.\nIn addition, Nvidia also revealed that SoftBank, using the chipmaker's AI Aerial computing platform, had piloted the world's first combined AI and 5G telecom network.\nThe attention now turns to Nvidia's third-quarter results for its 2025 fiscal year, with the chipmaker having guided to revenue of $32.5bn, plus or minus 2%, for the period in its previous quarterly report.\nStory continues\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Markets forecasts expect that number to be a little higher. If NVIDIA continues its strong run of beating market expectations, things could be better still.\"\n\"There\u2019s likely to be more emphasis however on the outlook for the final three months of the year, where consensus is currently looking for revenue of $36.6bn.\"\nIn the second quarter, revenue came in at $30bn, which was 122% higher than the previous year. Nvidia posted earnings per diluted share of $0.67, which was up 168% on the previous year.\n\"Any steer as to how well the recently launched ultra-fast Blackwell chip is selling will also be closely scrutinised,\" Nathan said.\n\"There\u2019s no shortage of demand as the likes of Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) look to gain an edge in the AI race. But there remain some unanswered questions about Nvidia\u2019s supply chain\u2019s ability to keep pace.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView quote details\nWalmart (WMT) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Tuesday 19 November\nWall Street will keeping an eye on retailer Walmart's latest results to see if it reports another solid quarter, as consumer price pressures persist.\nLatest data showed consumer prices grew by 2.6% in October, which was a slight uptick for the 2.4% rate of inflation recorded in September.\nThe figure was still above the US Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target but was in line with with expectations, sustaining investor hopes that the central bank will potentially cut interest rates again in December.\nHowever, there are concerns that potential policies around trade tariffs from president-elect Donald Trump, after he returns to the White House in January, could drive inflation higher.\nAs the world's largest retailer by sales, Walmart's results can provide an insight into US consumer sentiment.\nRead more: UK growth slows between July and September as services sector falters\nIn the second quarter, Walmart (WMT) logged revenue growth of 4.8% of $169.34bn, beating estimates of $168.46bn.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.67 also beat expectations of $0.65 and marked a 9.8% increase year-on-year.\nThis strong performance contributed to a 61% rise in Walmart shares year-to-date.\nCEO Doug McMillon said: \"Each part of our business is growing \u2013 store and club sales are up, e-commerce is compounding as we layer on pickup and even faster growth in delivery as our speed improves.\"\nFor the third quarter, Walmart guided to an increase of 3.25% to 4.25% in consolidated net sales, compared with the same period last year when it delivered $159.4bn in net sales.\nWalmart said it was expecting consolidated operating income to rise between 3% and 4.5% in the third quarter, up from $6.2bn last year.\nThe company expected adjusted earnings per share to come in at $0.51 to $0.52, compared with $0.51 for the third quarter last year.\n\u2022 USD\n(WMT)\nFollow\nView quote details\nImperial Brands (IMB.L) \u2014 Reports full-year results on Tuesday 19 November\nShares in tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMB.L) are currently trading at a five-year high, with the stock up 31% year-to-date.\nThat's despite the higher duties on cigarettes and vapes announced in the recent UK autumn budget.\n\"These moves add to a long list of regulatory and tax measures designed to deter consumers from smoking, after interventions on advertising and packaging design,\" said AJ Bell's Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth.\nEven so, the investment experts said that Imperial Brands continues to see strong profits and cash generation, much of which could be attributed to the five-year plan set out by CEO Stefan Bomhard, who took the reins in 2020.\nIn its full year results last year, Imperial Brands posted a 7.1% decline in tobacco volumes (excluding Russia), but the company raised its prices by an average of 11%. Sales in its next generation product segment rose 26%.\nRead more: Rachel Reeves hints at looser regulation in bid to improve UK's competitiveness\n\"Imperial will be looking to a similar recipe in the year to September 2024, for which chief executive Stefan Bomhard gave clear guidance alongside the full-year results for 2023 back in November,\" said Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth.\nIn its half-year results, Imperial Brands said it expected to deliver revenue growth in the low-single digits on a constant currency basis for its tobacco and next generation products segments.\nThe company forecast that adjusted operating profit would grow by close to the middle of its mid-single digit range.\nOn the back of this guidance, AJ Bell's investment experts said that analysts were expecting group adjusted operating profit of \u00a33.9bn, which would be flat on the previous year.\nAnalysts were also said to be expecting adjusted earnings per share of \u00a32.95, up from \u00a32.79 last year.\nIn terms of its dividend, Imperial Brands has produced three consecutive increases in the payout, with analysts said to be looking for another advance to \u00a31.53 per share in this set of results. The company also recently announced a further share buyback of \u00a31.25bn, which it is set to complete by the end of October 2025.\n\u2022 USD\n(IMB.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nJD Sports (JD.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter trading update on Thursday 21 November\nSportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) had a tougher start to its fiscal year but Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the situation has since picked up for the business. However, shares in the company are still down nearly 29% year-to-date.\nIn its interim results, JD Sports logged 5% growth in revenue to \u00a35.03bn, while profit before tax and adjusting items was up 2% to \u00a3405.6m.\n\"It was pleasing to see Europe, North America and Asia Pacific markets all posting double-digit sales growth,\" said Chiekrie. \"But the UK market remains challenging and volatile, and full-year profit guidance got a small downgrade as a result.\"\nHe said that JD Sports was trying to offset these challenges by \"tightening its belt and streamlining operations\".\nRead more: December UK interest rate cut unlikely despite GDP slowdown\n\"Investors will be hoping that means there won\u2019t be further downgrades to the full-year outlook in next week's results,\" he said.\nChiekrie said that investors would also be wanting to see how its takeover of US sporting goods supplier Hibbett is progressing, having completed the acquisition in July.\n\"The deal has substantially increased the group\u2019s footprint in the US, but there\u2019s a lot of work to do to make sure a deal of this size pulls in the expected benefits,\" he said.\nIn terms of its UK business, Andy Higginson, who is both chair of JD Sports and the British Retail Consortium, recently warned that tax rises on businesses announced in the autumn budget would result in prices to rise for shoppers.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the budget that employers would have to pay 15% in national insurance on salaries over \u00a35,000, rising from the current rate of 13.8% on salaries over \u00a39,100.\n\"I'm guaranteeing you today, if these go through as they are without any sort of feathering, we\u2019re going to see significant inflation in prices,\" Higginson said on the BBC's Today programme.\n\u2022 USD\n(JD.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nInternational Distribution Services (IDS.L) \u2014 Reports interim results on Thursday 21 November\nThe focus for investors in Royal Mail-owner International Distribution Services will be on the takeover of the company led by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.\nIDS agreed to the \u00a33.57bn takeover offer back in May, with the offer made through a special purpose vehicle, EP UK Bidco Limited, owned by J&T Capital Partners and EP Corporate Group. Kretinsky is the majority owner of EP Corporate Group.\nKeith Williams, the chair of IDS, said that the company's board had negotiated a \"far reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments which provide our customers, employees and broader stakeholders with important safeguards.\"\nRead more: What does the launch of pension megafunds mean for investors?\nMeanwhile, Kretinsky said: \"The EP Group has the utmost respect for Royal Mail's history and tradition, and I know that owning this business will come with enormous responsibility \u2013 not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day.\"\nIn terms of its company performance, IDS said that total parcels volumes were up 11% in its first quarter. Meanwhile, revenue across the IDS group had risen 8% to \u00a33.2bn.\nIn September, regulator Ofcom said it was considering changes to the UK postal service for Royal Mail. This included the potential scrapping of second class letter deliveries on Saturdays.\nHowever, a decision had not yet been made, with Ofcom saying it expected to consult on proposals for reform in early 2025, with a view to announcing a decision in summer 2025.\nIDS reportedly said that the \u201cchange cannot come soon enough\u201d to the UK postal service.\n\u2022 USD\n(IDS.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nOther companies reporting next week include:\nMonday 18 November\nBig Yellow (BYG.L)\nSirius Real Estate (SRE.L)\nTuesday 19 November\nDiploma (DPLM.L)\nAvon Protection (AVNBF)\nCML Microsystems (CML.L)\nRevolution Beauty (REVB.L)\nGB Group (GBG.L)\nGear4Music (G4M.L)\nXiaomi (1810.HK)\nSonova (SONVY)\nThyssenKrupp (TKA.DE)\nLowe\u2019s (LOW)\nMedtronic (MDT)\nDollar Tree (DLTR)\nAmer Sports (AS)\nDolby Laboratories (DLB)\nWednesday 20 November\nSage (SGE.L)\nMitchells & Butlers (MAB.L)\nTracsis (TRCS.L)\nRotork (ROR.L)\nSoftcat (SCT.L)\nBaloise (BALN.SW)\nSoitec (SLOIF)\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW)\nTarget (TGT)\nSnowflake (SNOW)\nNio (NIO)\nThursday 21 November\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\nGrainger (GRI.L)\nJet2 (JET2.L)\nMitie (MTO.L)\nSpeedy Hire (SDY.L)\nNorcros (NXR.L)\nWarehouse REIT (WHR.L)\nCrest Nicholson (CRST.L)\nBreedon (BREE.L)\nBaidu (BIDU)\nIntuit (INTU)\nPDD (PDD)\nWarner Music (WMG)\nGap (GAP)\nFriday 22 November\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\nMeituan (3690.HK)\nCathay Pacific Airways (CPCAF)\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\nRead more on stocks:\nTrending tickers: Tesla, Alibaba, Pfizer, Domino's and Disney\nFTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win\nHow Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for CrowdStrike Holdings, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.012 = US$53m \u00f7 (US$7.2b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).\nThus, CrowdStrike Holdings has an ROCE of 1.2%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 9.0%.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024\nIn the above chart we have measured CrowdStrike Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CrowdStrike Holdings for free.\nWhat Can We Tell From CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE Trend?\nThe fact that CrowdStrike Holdings is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 1.2% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 439% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.\nOur Take On CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE\nIn summary, it's great to see that CrowdStrike Holdings has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CrowdStrike Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\nOne more thing, we've spotted 2 warning signs facing CrowdStrike Holdings that you might find interesting.\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD has staged an impressive comeback, with shares rallying 34% over the past three months. This surge follows the significant dip in its share price triggered by the global IT outage on July 19, 2024.\nCRWD stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry and the S&P 500 index\u2019s rise of 16.2% and 10%, respectively, in the past three months. It has also fared better than other cybersecurity players, including Palo Alto Networks PANW, CyberArk Software CYBR and Check Point Software CHKP. Shares of Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk Software have soared 17.1% and 9.1%, respectively, while Check Point Software stock has declined 3.4% during the same time frame.\n3-Month Price Return Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis outperformance has made investors wonder if this is the right time to buy or hold CRWD stock and wait for more stability. Here\u2019s why maintaining a hold strategy could be the most prudent move.\nResilience in CRWD\u2019s Financial Performance Post Outage\nCrowdStrike\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company\u2019s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.\nThe company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm\u2019s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.\nThis robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike\u2019s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company\u2019s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation\nCrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.\nThe Falcon platform\u2019s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike\u2019s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Market Position and Customer Loyalty\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm\u2019s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.\nMoreover, the company's \u201cFalcon Flex\u201d subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.\nNavigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike\nDespite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company\u2019s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management\u2019s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.\nAnalysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPotential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike\u2019s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern\nCrowdStrike\u2019s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry\u2019s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now\nWhile CrowdStrike\u2019s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company is scheduled to release its earnings on November 26, 2024. On that day, CrowdStrike Holdings is projected to report earnings of $0.82 per share, which would represent no growth from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $982.26 million, indicating a 24.97% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion. These totals would mark changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.13% lower. Currently, CrowdStrike Holdings is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note CrowdStrike Holdings's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 93.93. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 32.89.\nWe can additionally observe that CRWD currently boasts a PEG ratio of 3.33. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.52.\nStory Continues\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 52, putting it in the top 21% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nEarlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike\u2019s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn\u2019t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon\u2019s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.\nClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 6th on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.\nIs Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?\nOn November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.\nNow that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined\u00a0Catalysts\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.\nMcLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.\nMcLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to \u201cswitch course.\u201d\nOn the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined\u00a0Wealth!\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.\nDatta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.\nHe suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to \u201cpivot away\u201d from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.\nStory Continues\nAs the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company provides a range of security products including identity management, threat intelligence, and threat detection.\nThe company has 29,000 clients in multiple sectors, including healthcare, retail, technology, and the government. Its AI-native cybersecurity platform, Falcon, is its primary product that grew at 80% year-over-year in FQ2 2025. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has recently closed crucial partnerships, added innovations to its Falcon Platform, and expanded its CrowdStrike Marketplace to meet the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions.\nThe July 19 incident has left a bearing on the company. Despite that, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been resilient and showcased transparency and accountability to its customers. On August 29, Joseph Gallo from Jefferies appeared in an interview on Schwab Network to share his thesis on CRWD. He shares that CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth.

As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.\nIn the last 5 years CrowdStrike Holdings saw its revenue grow at 39% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Fortunately, the market has not missed this, and has pushed the share price up by 41% per year in that time. Despite the strong run, top performers like CrowdStrike Holdings have been known to go on winning for decades.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's current watchlist.\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on stocks that could perform well regardless of who ends up running the White House. On Tuesday, Cramer observed that the day\u2019s market performance gave the impression that every stock could go higher no matter who secures the presidency.\nHe pointed to significant gains across various sectors, including aerospace, housing, retail, and healthcare. Cramer noted that this broad-based rally resulted in strong performances on Tuesday, with the Dow climbing 427 points, the S&P rising by 1.23%, and the NASDAQ soaring by 1.43%. However, he tempered his optimism by adding that days like Tuesday might prove to be outliers in the coming weeks.\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks\nCramer took the opportunity to highlight ten stocks he believes will thrive and said:\n\u201cI want to highlight ten stocks that I believe will do well under either candidate, a who\u2019s who of acclamation, companies that almost have to do well because of seismic trends and savvy managements. Companies that no White House would get hung up on, either because they\u2019re beneath notice or they\u2019re perceived as good corporate citizens by both sides. Stocks in industries that neither Trump nor Harris have ever targeted in the past.\u201d\nHe also raised an important question for the viewers: \u201cIf you had the results of the election in hand, would you really know what to buy or sell?\u201d According to Cramer, answering that question is far more complicated than it seems. He emphasized his list of stocks that can thrive regardless of the election outcome. These are companies that have no clear political adversaries in Washington, making them relatively safe bets. Cramer acknowledged, however, that many stocks that seem like obvious picks for one candidate or another often have hidden dynamics that don\u2019t get enough attention.\n\u201cIn the end, this presidential prognostication game is meaningless until we start hearing about cabinet appointments, those will tell us a lot. Then, we can figure out really who the winners and losers are. Right now, though, there are just too many political angles to every single stock story.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 5.

They know how to stop cybercrime better than anyone. I know it hurts our diversification efforts, but the Charitable Trust owns both these stocks because I'm a huge believer in cybersecurity and I'm not gonna be left behind by a great stock here.

It is known for its Falcon platform, a comprehensive suite of endpoint security solutions. Despite facing challenges earlier this year due to an outage that temporarily impacted its reputation, the company continues to be regarded as a top player in its field. During the fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings call, which ended on July 31, CEO George Kurtz acknowledged that the outage caused some prospective customers to delay signing contracts.\nHowever, he emphasized that most of these deals remain active in the sales pipeline, indicating that the company\u2019s position in the market is still strong. Its Falcon platform offers a wide range of security tools, with 28 modules available to customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, 65% of its customers were using at least five of these modules.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news.\nCNBC\u2019s Deidre Bosa joined \u2018Money Movers\u2019 to discuss the potential impact of a second Trump administration on the artificial intelligence trade. Bosa notes that artificial intelligence could be \u201cless regulated\u201d and \u201cmore volatile\u201d under Trump's leadership. However, the president-elect\u2019s AI policy could be a boon to the industry itself, albeit at the expense of necessary guardrails for AI. Back in June, Republicans adopted a new party platform containing a provision related to scrapping Biden\u2019s executive orders on AI.\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss and\u00a015 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nBiden\u2019s executive orders sought to tackle new technology threats by requiring developers of powerful AI systems to share their safety test results with the US government and also called on federal agencies to develop guidelines for the responsible use of AI domains. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s allies have been proposing a different executive order that would launch a series of \u201cManhattan Projects\u201d for developing military technology and immediately review \u201cunnecessary and burdensome regulations\u201d to \u201cMake America Great in AI\u201d.\nTrump, however, seems to be only one of the few who thinks imposing guardrails on artificial intelligence could prove detrimental to the US. A poll shared with Time reveals that Americans across the political spectrum are skeptical about the idea that the U.S. should avoid regulating AI to outcompete China. According to a poll by the AI Policy Institute (AIPI), 75% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans believe that \u201ctaking a careful controlled approach\u201d to AI is preferable as opposed to \u201cmoving forward on AI as fast as possible to be the first country to get extremely powerful AI.\u201d\nThe Latest Developments in AI\nAmid the ongoing debate, recent developments in AI are rapidly shaping the landscape in the backdrop. For instance, Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine, is said to be raising new investment that would value the search startup to a staggering $9 billion. The new funding round is set to raise $500 million led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which also holds a board seat in the startup.\nIn other news, OpenAI, an AI research lab and company, has acquired Chat.com, further adding to its collection of high-profile domain names. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the acquisition via email. While such AI-related news is often striking, AI capabilities continue to surprise even the most seasoned experts. In fact, AI can now even help you become a better parent. On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz's partner Justine Moore took to X to share an investment idea, advocating for \"a new wave of 'parenting co-pilots' powered by LLMs and agents.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nData is at the forefront of many inventions today and is the primary ingredient of innovation. Of the many branches of data usage, predictive analytics is garnering immense traction, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistics, modeling, and machine learning to forecast, predict, and plan future events. There are different types of predictive analytics including regression analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics market was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023. The global predictive analytics market is expected to grow to $95.3 billion by 2032 from $18.02 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%. The report attributes the growth in the industry to the growing investments in data by the government and large corporations followed by IoT and AI integrations. The use of predictive analytics is bifurcated into multiple segments including life sciences, automotive, retail, energy, telecom, and healthcare, to name a few.\nStartups Disrupting the Predictive Analytics Space\nThere are a range of startups in the predictive analytics space that are revolutionizing the industry. One such name is Pecan AI. The automated predictive analytics platform is developed and designed intricately to meet the needs of data scientists. Data scientists can use the platform to build powerful predictive AI capabilities and machine learning models that drive business impact. Data scientists do not need coding or data science skills to make use of the platform. The platform is used by a range of companies including Johnson & Johnson, SciPlay, Hydrant, Kenvue, Proper Cloth, and DME Acquire. Earlier in January, the company introduced predictive generative AI to transform enterprises. Pecan AI also has partnerships with some of the largest tech corporations and platforms including Azure and AWS.\nDataRobot is another leader in the predictive analytics industry that delivers revolutionary AI use cases for businesses. Its AI platform consists of core AI features such as generative AI, predictive AI, AI governance, AI observability, and AI foundation. The platform promises 83% faster deployment and secures nearly 1.4 billion predictions every day. Users can run models in minutes by skipping manual data preparation and cleaning. Additionally, the platform eliminates the need for repetitive coding, by streamlining feature discovery and defining elements of datasets automatically. Users can connect data from warehouses such as AWS and Azure into a singular workspace. Some of the predictive use cases facilitated by DataRobot include time series modeling, clustering and seasonality, cold start forecasting, nowcasting, and anomaly detection.\nStory Continues\nNow that we have studied the predictive analytics industry and some revolutionary startups, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now we went through multiple reports on the internet, ETFs, and stock screeners. We then examined the analyst upside of each stock and ranked the ones with the highest percentage. Our list is in ascending order of the analyst upside as of November 11, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Predictive Analytics Stock to Invest in Now?\nA data analyst working at a computer, crunching numbers for the company's 80% total assets.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nAnalyst upside as of November 11, 2024: 12%\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) offers predictive analytics through its Automation Analytics and Intelligence platform. The platform offers workload automation solutions supported by a predictive analytics workload platform allowing entities to visualize data and manage complex workloads that facilitate the development of crucial business insights.\nSome key features of the platform by Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) include cross-platform visibility, dynamic service level management, enhanced workload analytics, business monitoring, enhanced change control, and dynamic critical path discovery. All these features combined put AVGO ahead of its competitors.\nOverall, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a rapidly growing company with expertise in ASICs, infrastructure software, and data analytics, contributing to its ranking on our list. Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their median price target of $200 implies an upside of 12%, as of November 11.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cWe continued to build our position in\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 8th on our list of best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain.\nWhile the stock has fallen 10% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.5% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 39% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 140.31.\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Earnings Per Share Growth November 16th 2024\nDive deeper into Broadcom's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Broadcom's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWhat About Dividends?\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Broadcom's TSR for the last 5 years was 507%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nA Different Perspective\nWe're pleased to report that Broadcom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 71% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 43%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.\nStory Continues\nOf course Broadcom may not be the best stock to buy.

UBS estimated that four U.S. technology giants that are member of the so-called \u201cmagnificent 7\u201d will spend around $267 billion as capital expenditure on AI applications in 2025, a jump of 33.5% year over year.\n5 AI Bigwigs to Buy With Double-Digit Short-Term Appreciation\nEach of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves.\nAccording to the \"Hyperscale Data Centers - Global Strategic Business Report\", the global market for hyperscale data centers is estimated to reach US$730.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 23.1% from 2023 to 2030. From the increasing adoption of cloud services to the rise of big data and artificial intelligence, several factors are at play when it comes to its rapid growth. As per the report, the biggest driver is cloud computing, with more and more companies migrating their workloads to the cloud to reduce costs, improve scalability, and enhance flexibility.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\u00a0and\u00a08 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now\nThese hyperscalers need a lot of energy to run their data centers around the clock. According to McKinsey & Company, data center power needs are expected to grow three times higher than the current capacity by the end of the decade, from between 3 and 4 percent of total US power demand today to between 11 and 12 percent in 2030. Naturally, the power sector has become a significant AI player. Several technology companies are looking at nuclear power, including the use of small modular reactors (SMR), to meet their electricity needs.\n\u201cDriven by recent trends in AI development, projected power consumption by data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase in the range from 8% to 17% by 2030\u2014or potentially even higher, as progress in AI technologies is not linear but exponential, as seen in Silicon Valley today\u201d.\nRecent AI News\nAs the demand for advanced computing power grows, the latest AI breakthroughs are reshaping industries and driving innovation at an unprecedented pace. Then again, nothing is perfect. A few days back, OpenAI\u2019s premier chatbot, ChatGPT, went down for a total of 30 minutes. According to an outage tracking website Downdetector, over 19,000 people were impacted due to the chatbot\u2019s unavailability. Sam Altman, the CEO, admitted to the outage on X and apologized.\nThe same company is said to be hitting stumbling blocks recently. That\u2019s because, according to Bloomberg, its latest model Orion hasn\u2019t been performing as well as the developers had hoped for. OpenAI, however, isn\u2019t the only company seemingly facing a plateau. Three leading AI companies are now seeing diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build newer models.\nStory Continues\nIn other news, search habits are changing across the globe now that artificial intelligence is here. According to research from Yext, a digital presence platform for multi-location brands, 45% of customers are likely to use and trust an AI tool for finding more information about a brand, while 51% now use social media, and 28% turn to voice assistants.\n\u201cGoogle impressions have dropped 8-20% in the past two years, pushing marketers to adapt as search behaviour shifts with AI-driven overviews, chatbots and social media searches. Instagram and TikTok have become favoured alternative search engines, particularly for younger consumers\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nMarket Capitalization: $823.05 billion\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. It designs chips for companies that are building AI data centers.\nOn November 12, Citi analyst Christopher Danely noted that recent earnings saw semiconductor consensus estimates dropping by 11% while the SOX index, which measures semiconductor stocks, fell by 9%. The declines largely come from Microchip, NXP Semiconductors, and Intel; but the firm believes that the selloff is \u201calmost over and attention will shift to 2025\u201d. Citi further states that industrial market struggles will end sometime in the first half of 2025. Since 75% of semiconductor demand looks solid, investors should start investing more in them going into Q1. One of its Buy-rated names is Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). Broadcom has also been deemed an important stock by Jefferies analysts, who expect outperformance from it later in 2025.\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that should not be ignored.\nArtificial Intelligence is driving an unprecedented expansion in the potential market size for hardware and software products. According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the \u201cCNBC Connect\u201d event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI\u2019s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology.\n\u201cThree years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you\u201d.\nREAD ALSO: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 8 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now\nLatest Developments in AI\nLet\u2019s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported.\nIn other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation\u2019s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC\u2019s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation.\nStory Continues\nSpeaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training\u2014the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures\u2014have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring \u201ctest-time compute,\u201d a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called \u201cinference\u201d phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia\u2019s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nMarket Capitalization: $835.61 billion\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. It designs chips for companies that are building AI data centers.\nOn November 7, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis reaffirmed his \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), citing surging demand for AI chips that will last \u201cseveral years\u201d to benefit the technology company. According to Curtis, the AI accelerator market will grow by 58% a year from $47 billion in 2023 to $287 billion in 2027. Moreover, there isn\u2019t a sign of a CapEx spending slowdown from the major technology companies as well. While Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s chip business is largely driven by Google, other companies are also likely to use it in a significant manner in the years to come.\n\u201cWe see the most near-term upside at Marvell and Nvidia, but do expect outperformance from Broadcom later in 2025\u201d.\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks that should not be ignored. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.29%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.86%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.09%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 1.87% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.3% in that time.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Broadcom Inc. will be of great interest to investors.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 69.19%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology powerhouse known for its expertise in semiconductor design, development, and supply, alongside its enterprise software and security solutions. The company\u2019s cybersecurity portfolio includes a range of products, such as its Symantec Enterprise Cloud platform, as well as solutions for payment, mainframe, network, endpoint, and identity security.\nIn the third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, marking a 47% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and solid non-AI semiconductor performance. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects its AI revenue to rise 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the total for the year to $12 billion, primarily fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOn November 5, BofA reaffirmed its Buy rating on AVGO, citing the company's leadership in AI computing and networking, along with its strong free cash flow. However, the bank lowered its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast due to seasonal challenges, particularly stemming from a product transition with Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) that is expected to affect revenue in the first half of the year. Still, Broadcom\u2019s position is expected to be buoyed by new AI and networking contracts, along with further opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to adjusted earnings per share of $7.31 by 2026. As AI adoption continues to grow, Broadcom\u2019s focus on high-performance AI networking solutions, especially in complement to NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell architecture, could potentially strengthen its future prospects.\nOverall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other AI headlines you shouldn't miss.\nSovereign AI: a new concept gaining traction in the realm of artificial intelligence. As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing \u201csovereign\u201d artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to \u201ccodify\u201d a country\u2019s culture, history, and collective intelligence.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News You Must Read Today.\nThat said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.\u201d\nWhile AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.\nLatest Advancements in AI\nIn recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification\u201d.\nStory Continues\nOther fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.\nIn other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed \u201cOperator\u201d, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human\u2019s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. The planned release is part of a wider industry movement towards agents\u2014AI software capable of performing multi-step tasks for users with minimal oversight.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc (NOW) and Five9 Partner to Revolutionize Customer Experience with AI\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc.

ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self\u2011service and assisted service across voice and digital channels.

        "whole_article": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia\u2019s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.\nThis partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.\nFor the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%.

        "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013November 15, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Toast TOST, as the Bull of the Day and Clean Harbors CLH, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nToast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.\nThe stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock\u2019s ongoing upward momentum.\nAbout the Company\nToast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.\nWith its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.\nIts platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.\nToast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of \u201cA\u201d in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a \u201cF\u201d in Value.\nQ3 Earnings Beat\nOn November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.\nQ3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.\nThe company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.\nGross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.\nManagement comments were overwhelmingly bullish:\n\u201cToast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.\u201d\nEstimates Headed Higher\nAnalysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.\nStory Continues\nFor the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.\nFor the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.\nFor the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.\nToast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote\nWith the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.\nJPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.\nThe Technical Take\nThe stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO\u2019d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.\nAfter trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.\nWith the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.\nPost earnings low: $36\nGap fill: $33\n21-day: $32\n50-day: $29.20\n200-day: $25.20\nFibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32\nWhile that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.\nIn Summary\nToast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.\nThe company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.\nAs Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.\nBear of the Day:\nClean Harbors \u00a0is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.\nThe company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?\nWith an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.\nAbout the Company\nClean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).\nThe company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world\u2019s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.\nCLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cD\u201d in Value, But \u201cB\u201d in both Momentum and Growth.\nQ3 Earnings\nThe company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.\nDespite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.\nPositive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.\nWhile there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.\nEarnings Estimates\nEstimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.\nFor the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.\nLooking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.\nFor the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year\u2019s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.\nTechnical Take\nThe drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.\nThis volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.\nThe drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.\nThe stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.\nIn Summary\nClean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.\nWith significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.\nAdditional content:\nServiceNow Expands Generative AI Offerings: Is the Stock a Buy?\nServiceNow\u00a0is adding Generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to the Now platform to foster responsible AI.

The free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, subscription revenues are projected between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 21.5-22% on a GAAP basis.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

        "whole_article": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in NOW?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "whole_article": "Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.\nInsiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nNYSE:NOW Insider Trading Volume November 14th 2024\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of ServiceNow\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?\nInsiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for ServiceNow you should be aware of.\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nMarket Capitalization: $215.95 billion\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps digitize and unify organizations so that they can find smarter, faster, better ways to make work flow.\nOn November 12, Wells Fargo raised the firm\u2019s price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $1,150 from $1,050 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares. According to the firm, ServiceNow is among the few companies that are demonstrating tangible AI monetization, i.e. they are really making money from AI. One of the key catalysts that will drive this momentum forward is the launch of its CSM/ITSM agents in Xanadu on November 24. The launch is a major step for the company in enhancing its AI-led customer service offerings. Finally, Wells Fargo expects ServiceNow to take the lead in AI customer service.\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?\u201d\nCramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.\n\u201cTrump wants to cut taxes\u2014all taxes\u2014including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It\u2019s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that\u2019s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.\u201d\nCramer said the market is still \u201coversold\u201d as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground.

        "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

By combining the strengths of ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) and the Five9 platform, the solution will create more streamlined self-service and assisted service operations and unify customer support processes to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and simplify contact center operations.\n\"Organizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together,\" said John Ball, senior vice president, Customer and Industry Workflows at ServiceNow. \"ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self-service and assisted service across voice and digital channels. Our expanded partnership with Five9 takes this even further, combining the best of both platforms to streamline and unify contact center operations with a turnkey solution that\u2019s fast to deploy and delivers fast ROI.\"\n\"Five9\u2019s longstanding partnership with ServiceNow has been rooted in the joint mission to create seamless and powerful end-to-end customer experiences,\" said Callan Schebella, executive vice president, product management, Five9. \"This next phase of our partnership transforms the approach to customer experience management, alleviating a lot of the frustrations that come with using multiple systems to address customer needs. We\u2019ve taken a big step forward to empower customers with our joint AI capabilities and improved interface functionality, easing the day-to-day challenges of customer-facing service.\"\n\"Combining the most valuable features into a unified interface can transform the way we support our customers,\" said Bob Massengill, senior director, Technology Infrastructure, Pilot Travel Centers, LLC. \"This new ServiceNow-Five9 joint solution has the potential to enable us to address customer needs more quickly and effectively.\"\nStory Continues\nThe new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.\nReal-time Transcription \u2013 Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents\u2019 work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.\nUnified Routing \u2013 Five9\u2019s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9. This reduces operational overhead for managers through streamlined routing management across both systems, making it easier to adjust staffing during high-demand periods. It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.\nSingle Agent Experience \u2013 Native Call Controls within ServiceNow\u2019s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer\u2019s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.\nAvailability\nThe ServiceNow and Five9 integrated capabilities are expected to be available to select customers in the first half of 2025.\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

With this launch, ServiceNow is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio for customers. This includes new, expanded Now Assist capabilities that drive greater visibility and controls with an AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices. Native multilingual support in Now Assist extends GenAI\u2019s global footprint for seamless, culturally aware communications and translations. Finally, purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety.\nAs enterprises have accelerated the adoption of GenAI, they are discovering that siloed applications and scattered data are barriers to impact and that establishing clearly defined, human-centric governance processes are essential to the effective use and oversight of GenAI. That\u2019s why ServiceNow delivers a winning combination of one platform with an integrated data layer and continues to optimize its AI platform for speed, scale, and security. The single architecture of the Now Platform helps ensure strong governance is embedded in its Now Assist GenAI solutions, models, and agents no matter where they are deployed in an organization.\n\"Enterprises across every industry are embracing a future of greater autonomy and productivity, all in service to their employees, customers, and overall business impact,\" said Jon Sigler, senior vice president of Platform and AI at ServiceNow. \"The ServiceNow platform was built to empower this transformation, offering smarter, faster ways of working through AI-enabled automation. With governance at the core, these new innovations bring more personalized, collaborative, trusted experiences to life across the enterprise.\"\nElevating customer trust with integrated AI governance\nTeams working with AI are often burdened with siloed tools and systems, making visibility and AI governance difficult. AI governance requires the integration of complex business processes and needs a best-of-breed workflow platform to be implemented successfully. With a unified AI inventory data model for connecting AI strategy, technology, security, and compliance to operate as an AI control tower, and expanded oversight for AI Governance for Now Assist, ServiceNow is laying a foundation to help customers build trust while accelerating business transformation.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also introduced new Now Assist capabilities that empower customers with the tools needed for responsible AI use:\nNow Assist Guardian provides built-in monitoring and responsible AI guardrails so customers can better control the use of GenAI on the Now Platform. This includes the management and mitigation of offensive content, security vulnerabilities, and the exposure of sensitive information.\nNow Assist Data Kit eases the often-cumbersome task of managing and consuming data for AI use cases. Users can create and easily manage datasets for AI skills and applications, develop ground truth datasets to benchmark for accuracy and help predict AI outcomes, and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of experiences built with Now Assist Skill Kit.\nNow Assist Analytics offers greater visibility into the adoption, usage, and performance of Now Assist across the enterprise. With these insights, customers can make more informed, data-driven decisions to advance GenAI adoption, evaluate ROI on GenAI investments, and enable better business outcomes.\nExtending the value and impact of GenAI globally\nWith today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow is adding new built-in multilingual features to Now Assist. These new features address customer demand and expand the application of ServiceNow\u2019s GenAI solutions in global markets. Now Assist can now generate, summarize, and respond to GenAI prompts in the user\u2019s native language, providing improved, culturally aware understanding and communication for both agents and requestors.\nThe following languages are supported natively by Now Assist: English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese. Other languages will continue to be supported with ServiceNow\u2019s existing Dynamic Translation, which automatically translates user inputs and a response back in the user\u2019s language.\nAccelerating productivity with tailored Now Assist solutions\nBuilding on the Xanadu platform release\u2014which marked the company\u2019s most comprehensive set of AI innovations to date\u2014ServiceNow has further expanded Now Assist solutions, purpose-built for specific enterprise use cases. From configuration management to legal affairs and health and safety, GenAI can help transform the productivity and efficacy of these critical internal functions.\nNow Assist for Configuration Management Database (CMDB) uses AI to make managing and understanding data easier for customers. It helps users keep a clean and accurate CMDB by reducing duplicate data, simplifying complex information, and streamlining data input. With Now Assist for CMDB, users can quickly view summaries of Configuration Items (CIs) and their dependencies, and AI can find and fix duplicate data automatically. It also assists in the setup of Service Graph Connectors to bring data into the CMDB and fix any issues that come up during the process.\nNow Assist for Legal Service Delivery helps legal teams deliver faster service to clients with auto-generated summaries of legal requests and matters. Legal teams are often juggling multiple requests and complex legal matters, such as investigations, simultaneously. With Now Assist, they can fulfill these requests with greater efficiency and faster time to resolution.\nNow Assist in Contract Management streamlines contract processing and reduces risk by leveraging GenAI to automatically flag non-standard language, identify missing clauses and suggest revisions within contracts such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Additionally, GenAI provides rapid insights into contractual terms and obligations by intelligently extracting metadata from contracts. This helps reduce cost, revenue leakage, and risk for the enterprise.\nNow Assist for Health and Safety helps ensure a safer environment for employees by streamlining incident management processes while reducing manual, repetitive work for health and safety workers. It uses GenAI to auto-generate summaries of safety incidents and lessons learned based on incident records, resulting in more effective communication, improved agent productivity, and proactive prevention and resolution of incidents.\nIn addition to these new innovations, ServiceNow Impact\u2014the ServiceNow customer success solution to maximize AI, optimize performance, provide on-demand expertise, and accelerate business value\u2014includes new GenAI accelerators to help make adoption of Now Assist solutions easier and faster for customers.\n\"Worldwide spending on AI is projected to grow 3 times greater than the five-year CAGR for worldwide IT spending over the same period (2023-2028), driven by the rapid infusion of AI and GenAI for employee experience, customer engagement, business processes, and industry innovation,\" said Ritu Jyoti, general manager/group VP, AI, and Data market research and advisory at IDC. \"As organizations look to drive value from AI transformations, they recognize the need for a single and scalable platform that connects people, processes, data, and systems. ServiceNow is meeting customers where they are by streamlining workflows and simplifying complex processes on a single AI-powered platform. As ServiceNow expands GenAI into new areas of the enterprise, the company continues to help organizations transform operations and stay competitive.\"\nCustomers like EY are already seeing the benefits of Now Assist.\n\"GenAI is having a huge impact on our organization, both in the way EY teams deliver EY services and support EY people, but also in creating opportunities to go to market with ServiceNow to help EY clients transform their businesses,\" said Hank Prybylski, Global Vice Chair, Transformation, EY. \"We are seeing incredible value in the Now Assist space and looking to extend that to a whole suite of areas including customer service management and more broadly to our managed services environment.\"\nPutting data and AI to work across the Now Platform\nOn top of today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow recently announced Workflow Data Fabric, a breakthrough innovation that enhances all ServiceNow workflows, AI solutions, and AI Agents.\nThis enhanced, integrated data layer allows customers to connect, understand, and act on structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data across the enterprise, inside and outside of ServiceNow. Coupled with zero copy capabilities and the future integration of Knowledge Graph, which transforms raw data into contextual insights, ServiceNow is unifying people, processes, operations, and systems so AI can work more autonomously across the enterprise.\nThese data capabilities are an instrumental part of ServiceNow's vision of AI Agents that work autonomously and collaboratively with people to enable business transformation. This vision also includes the expansion of its partnership with NVIDIA to jointly develop AI agent use cases on the Now Platform and accelerate the adoption of Agentic AI, reinventing how AI delivers value across all industries.\nAvailability\nAI Governance for Now Assist is available today to a limited set of customers and is expected to be generally available in Q1 2025. All other new GenAI innovations announced today are now generally available to customers in the ServiceNow Store.\nAdditional Information\nLearn more about ServiceNow Now Assist here.\nRead about additional news from ServiceNow today:\nNew innovations enhance developer productivity, industry momentum\nServiceNow and Five9 expand partnership to deliver unified, end-to-end agent and customer experiences\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.

        "whole_article": "Investing.com - Cloud software providers are expected to see a recovery in customer spending as a resilient economic environment pushes more businesses to invest in their artificial intelligence-powered technologies, according to analysts at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and peer Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) have also been pouring money into building out their own AI capabilities and folding them into their products, although investors have raised concerns around the timeline for the pay off from these expenditures.\nIn a note to clients, the Wells Fargo analysts led by Michael Turrin argued that ServiceNow is among the few software comapnies \"demonstrating tangible AI monetization,\" adding they expect the group to \"play offense\" in AI customer service. Businesses use ServiceNow's AI-backed products to automate and manage their IT processes and reduce costs.\nLast month, ServiceNow unveiled a fourth-quarter subscription revenue forecast that topped Wall Street expectations.\nThe firm, which has been rolling out new AI-enhanced offerings to its enterprise clients such as ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and video conferencing service Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), also increased its full-year subscription revenue outlook thanks to solid demand from new and existing customers.\nMeanwhile, ServiceNow's rival Salesforce has yet to show enough evidence its own AI offering will be enough to return growth to double-digits in the near term, the Wells Fargo analysts said.\nIn August, the software-as-a-service pioneer reported better-than-anticipated revenue of $9.33 billion in its second quarter and raised its annual profit outlook to a range of $10.03 to $10.11 per share, up from $9.86 to $9.94. But Salesforce's guidance for third-quarter revenue still missed expectations, exacerbating worries around a potential rebound in cloud spending.\nThe Wells Fargo analysts said they see more \"attractive opportunities\" in companies like ServiceNow that have already shown an ability to make money off of so-called generative AI. The setup for Salesforce heading into next is \"tough,\" they added.\nRelated Articles\nCloud software groups recovering heading into the end of 2024, Wells Fargo says\nNovavax cuts 2024 revenue forecast again on lower COVID vaccine sales\nTyson Foods beats quarterly results on strong demand for beef, pork\nView Comments"

And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 6.7%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
