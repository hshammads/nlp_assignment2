          "whole_article": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Meta Platforms (META) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this social media company a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 51.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 32.2%.\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.57, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 20.8% this year versus the industry average of 7.1%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nStory Continues\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Meta Platforms (META) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 52 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 52 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 82.7% and 3.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for META\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for META\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Meta Platforms, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs META Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.1% over the past month to $22.53.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms.

          "whole_article": "By Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - Numenta, a company with backing from the Gates Foundation, on Wednesday released an open-source AI model it hopes will require less energy and data to create intelligent machines than existing technologies.\nNumenta was co-founded by Jeff Hawkins, the founder of Palm Computing in the 1990s, which in turn invented the Palm Pilot. Hawkins' deepest academic interest is neuroscience, which showed up in the Palm Pilot's handwriting recognition software that leveraged an earlier era of artificial intelligence.\nWhile most of today's popular AI systems are roughly modeled on human brains with a technology called neural networks, Numenta has a different idea of how the brain works and hopes to persuade AI researchers to try its approach.\nMost current AI systems ingest huge amounts of static data - such as massive libraries of text or images - and run that through thousands or even tens of thousands of computing chips. After weeks or months of computing using vast amounts of electricity, the AI system is trained to generate responses to human queries.\nNumenta believes that such training can be a more constant process, where brain cells gather small bits of information from senses such as sight and touch and constantly develop models of the world that can be modified on the fly as conditions change, like a young child learning a new toy.\nThe company says the approach can be applied to robots that learn to navigate the world and other types of knowledge like writing. On Wednesday, it will release open source computer code to let other companies and researchers try its approach.\nOther firms such as Meta Platforms have also made their AI technology freely available. That has helped Meta catch up to rivals such as OpenAI, but has also led to the use of Meta's technology by the Chinese military.\nSubutai Ahmad, Numenta's chief executive, said the company will closely monitor how its technology is used once it becomes public.\n\"The technology is still early, and the way we deal with this will depend on the exact way the technology matures,\" Ahmad told Reuters. \"These are important issues that we need to think about.\"\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler)\nView Comments"

Luckey is sitting pretty with well over $1 billion in military contracts and a fleet of Anduril\u2019s weapons being used in the Russia-Ukraine war.\nLuckey\u2019s long-standing support of Trump\u2014since at least 2011, when he has said he wrote to Trump and asked him to run for office, and through this year\u2019s election cycle, during which he donated $400,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign, according to filings means he may have the ear of the most powerful man in the world.\nWhat does he want to do now? Work on a new headset project.\nLuckey says that he has envisioned applying Anduril\u2019s AI-powered 3D battlefield-mapping platform Lattice to this kind of hardware from the beginning of the company, and that it was one of the ideas in the original 2017 pitch deck for investors.\nAnduril founder Palmer Luckey photographed at Anduril's factory in Santa Ana, California on Nov. 6, 2024. Maggie Shannon for Fortune\n\u201cI wanted to prove that I wasn\u2019t a one-hit wonder,\u201d says Luckey, now 32. \u201cThat I was still somebody.\"\nBut Luckey\u2019s investors were wary of the gaming-headset tycoon\u2019s motives, he recalls. They initially thought \u201cit would turn into a pissing contest with Facebook\u201d and encouraged him to go in another direction and focus \u201con what you think is the most important for the country\u2014not most important for your ego.\u201d Luckey took the advice and focused on other projects, like autonomous surveillance towers that are used at the U.S. borders, and drones that have been deployed in Ukraine.\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, Microsoft had been developing its HoloLens headsets for the U.S. Army since 2018. Anduril announced in September that it had come on board to improve the combat goggles\u2019 performance, in a deal with the Pentagon that may generate as much as $21.9 billion for the two companies over the next decade. Lattice pulls various sensory data to create a 3D battlefield map in the headset, to help soldiers see how to safely get from one point to another or distinguish allies from enemies on the battlefield.\nOther attempts to incorporate headset hardware into military applications over the years haven\u2019t worked out. The Army\u2019s Nett Warrior system, for example, abandoned headset plans over a decade ago, pivoting to a smartphone. Luckey says the problem is that the data flowing into the devices\u2014 like 2D maps\u2014isn\u2019t useful enough, and he asserts that Anduril\u2019s Lattice system, which pulls data from satellite feeds, drones, and infrared imaging units, will change that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if people think that I\u2019m nice or cool or fashionable. But I do care that they think that I am moral. I do care if they think that I am a reliable partner who is not going to stab them in the back.\u201d\nAfter his ordeal with the Oculus, it\u2019s clear that Luckey is delighted to be back in the headset business. He was terminated by Facebook in 2017 after a donation he made to a pro-Trump group led to speculation that he was associated with members who had made racist comments online. Amid the backlash, Luckey issued an apology. But he now regrets allowing other people to \u201cdictate my press strategy\u201d and persuade him not to push back against news coverage he says was \u201ccompletely fabricated.\u201d\nSeven years later, Luckey says the ordeal has deeply influenced his approach to business and people. He admits he is always asking himself how things could go wrong: \u201cWhat is the worst situation I could end up in with this person or this company? If this goes south, what is the worst thing that could happen to me?\u201d And he generally goes into conversations thinking, \u201cThis person is gonna try to f--k me.\u201d\nIn his new line of work, this approach \u201chas worked out pretty well,\u201d he says. Anduril has become the leader of a new pack of tech companies that is challenging the sector\u2019s longtime incumbents, such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, by using private capital to innovate, rather than waiting on funding from government contracts to develop new technologies. Anduril inked a nearly $1 billion contract in 2022 with U.S. Special Operations Command for counter drones and, earlier this year, a $250 million Department of Defense contract for one of its interceptor systems. It works closely with the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.K. Ministry of Defense, and the Australian Defense Force. (Anduril\u2019s drones have been used in Ukraine, but its technology has not been used in Gaza, Luckey said.) A 5-million-square-foot manufacturing facility in an undisclosed location is in the works. And Anduril continues to come out with new products\u2014most recently a family of combat drones called Bolt.\nAnduril introduced its Bolt family of man-packable, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) Autonomous Air Vehicles (AAVs). Courtesy of Anduril\nA veteran of the intelligence software startup Palantir, Brian Schimpf cofounded Anduril and serves as CEO, but it\u2019s Luckey who is the most well-known of its executives and often serves as the public face of the company, doing what he calls \u201cpropagandizing\u201d at conferences and in the media.\nLuckey acknowledges that part of what he\u2019s propagandizing for is his own reputation. \u201cI realized too late that my reputation is actually very important,\u201d he says. \u201cI cannot accomplish anything of significance if I don\u2019t care what people think of me\u2026And that is what I\u2019m most terrified of at this point.\u201d He does it in his own bombastic way, of course: He will debate critics of Anduril drones on X, hurling crass insults such as \u201cr----d\u201d at them (and others).\nLuckey rejects, however, the notion that he is a bigot. In the aftermath of his defenestration from Facebook, Luckey recalls, \u201cI allowed people to believe things that were totally false. And if they believe that I\u2019m an anti-Semitic, hateful, racist person who\u2019s paying people to harass people on the internet, of course they don\u2019t want to work with me.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if people think that I\u2019m nice or cool or fashionable,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I do care that they think that I am moral. I do care if they think that I am a reliable partner who is not going to stab them in the back. I do want people to understand that I am loyal to the people who share common cause with me, and that I will not turn on them. And as long as I can convince enough people of that, I don\u2019t really mind the rest.\nThis article appears in the December 2024/January 2025 issue of Fortune with the headline \"What Palmer Luckey, the man revolutionizing warfare, is afraid of.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:META) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.\nWhen it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there\u2019s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University\u2019s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).\nFounded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university\u2019s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard\u2019s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard\u2019s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university\u2019s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard\u2019s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.\nAccording to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. \u201cNarv\u201d Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia\u2019s 11.5% or Brown\u2019s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC\u2019s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:\n\u201cIn FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC\u2019s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.\u201d\nNotably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from \"overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500.\" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar\u2019s strategy of overhauling the university\u2019s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Harvard Management Company\u2019s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024.

With AI models from startups like OpenAI, companies are offering natural language search capabilities to users that are cutting away Google's dominance in the Search market. Latest reports from news publication Bloomberg suggest that Google now faces added pressure with authorities in the US reportedly pushing the firm to spin off its Chrome browser business. The report further claims that authorities are also planning to recommend to a federal judge that Google face antitrust requirements related to AI and its Android mobile operating system.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe measures are a byproduct of a multilayer case that the Justice Department has built against Google. The government won the first round in the case earlier this year, which sought to prove that the tech giant has a web search monopoly in the US. In the ruling on this case, federal judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets. Per the Justice Department, the case against Chrome stems from the fact that the browser is a key access point through which many people use Google Search.

The company\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite chips power Microsoft\u2019s latest-generation Surface laptops, which feature the GenAI Copilot assistant.\n\u2022 USD\n(QCOM)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n\u201cEverybody that buys an X Elite is extremely happy with it,\u201d Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in an interview following the investor day in New York. \u201cFrom all of our OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and Microsoft, the current response is exceeding everybody's expectation.\u201d\nAmon called the $4 billion target for the PC business \u201chigh confidence.\u201d\nSome analysts, however, said the road there may not be smooth.\n\u201cWhile management is optimistic about AI PC opportunities, Windows-on-ARM skepticism and intense competition (from both x86 and ARM SoC suppliers) could limit QCOM\u2019s opportunity,\u201d Raymond James\u2019 Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to clients. He has a Hold-equivalent Market Perform rating on the stock.\nBank of America\u2019s Tal Liani rates Qualcomm a Buy and \u201ccame away incrementally positive on Qualcomm\u2019s long-term positioning and the diversification outside of handsets.\u201d\nBut Liani pointed out that not only is the company entering markets with emerging tech, but it also needs to grab market share.\n\"These markets need to develop to support Qualcomm's long-term targets, of which the pace and magnitude [are] uncertain,\" he wrote.\nCristiano Amon, CEO & President, Qualcomm, on Centre Stage during day one of Web Summit 2024 at the MEO Arena in Lisbon, Portugal. (Shauna Clinton/Sportsfile for Web Summit via Getty Images) \u00b7 Shauna Clinton via Getty Images\nQualcomm\u2019s biggest business remains smartphones, and its ramped-up diversification comes as Apple (AAPL) is working on migrating away from Qualcomm modems. As for the Android-based business, Amon said he\u2019s projecting mid-single-digit growth, what he calls a \u201cconservative assumption.\u201d\nThat means the company expects to end the decade with revenue about evenly split between handsets at 50% and autos and Internet of Things combined at the other 50%.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe narrative of solid earnings power even ex-AAPL seems alive, and in general the assumptions don\u2019t appear to require any huge stretches,\u201d wrote Bernstein\u2019s Stacy Rasgon, who has an Outperform recommendation on Qualcomm shares.\nQualcomm shares have lagged this year amid that expected Apple transition, rising just under 7% compared with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index\u2019s (^SOX) 16% gain.\nSo what about artificial intelligence? Amon expects the adoption of smartphones with more AI capabilities to be an unpredictable process but one that\u2019s ultimately beneficial for Qualcomm.\n\u201cIt is hard to make a prediction because, at the end of the day, it's all based on what developers are going to come up with,\u201d he said in the interview.\n\"I can go back to the conversation between feature phones and smartphones and BlackBerrys, and smartphones started with 10 apps, then a hundred apps, then thousands of apps, and then you start to see the big switch,\" he added. \"And I feel the same way about AI use cases. I can't really tell you it's going to be this year or next year. I can tell you within five years I think we are going to have all using an AI smartphone. Anything that happens faster, it's going to be an upgrade cycle that we're going to benefit tremendously.\u201d\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Raymond James managing director Srini Pajjuri.

Nearly $99 billion is pegged on two iconic names: Apple and Coca-Cola. Through Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has reduced his Apple stake significantly in 2024, trimming it by about two-thirds.\nBerkshire now holds approximately 300 million shares of Apple stock, valued at $69.9 billion as of September, down from 905 million shares at the end of 2023. Despite this, Apple remains Berkshire\u2019s largest equity position, accounting for 28% of the portfolio, as cited by CNBC.\nDon't Miss:\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $1,000\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before it closes in a few days\nHis strategy here is simple but powerful \u2013 backing companies with brand strength and consistent financials. Apple's stock, for instance, surged 31% this year and many see this as Buffett's savviest move yet. Some say it's his \"crown jewel,\" lauding his foresight in spotting a tech company that's proven as resilient as it is profitable.\nBut as with any big bet, Buffett's heavy reliance on Apple has sparked some chatter. Skeptics say putting so many eggs in one tech basket could be risky. With tech stocks, there's always the threat of shifting consumer trends, not to mention the occasional market shake-up.\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nAnd while Apple has shown impressive gains this year, the latest numbers hint at a slight cooling. In the last fiscal year, Apple's total revenue dipped by 0.8% \u2013 a small shift but enough to raise eyebrows. According to Business Insider, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring believes Apple has room to climb, setting a price target of $273 from the current $216.\nApple's pivot toward services is holding it steady. Though iPhone sales may ebb and flow, Apple's revenues from the App Store, streaming and cloud services have grown by 23% over the past few years.\nServices have also helped Apple boost its profit margins, going from 43.3% in 2022 to 46.2% in 2024, catching Wall Street's attention. These margins and the cash flow from services make Apple's high share prices easier to swallow, especially as it could mean bigger dividends for shareholders.\nStory Continues\nTrending: With over 7.8K investors including Meta, Google, And Amazon Execs \u2014 this AI Startup's valuation has skyrocketed from $5 million to $85 million in just three years. Be an early investor with just $1,000 for only $0.50/share today before the offer closes in the next few days!\nThen there's Coca-Cola, which stands out as Buffett's textbook choice. It's familiar, steady and beloved worldwide. His initial investment in Coca-Cola in the late \u201880s has since grown to a $27.67 billion stake and despite recent bumps \u2013 like a 12% drop from September's peak \u2013 investors still see value here.\nMorgan Stanley's Dara Mohsenian predicts Coca-Cola could climb to $76 a share, marking a potential 19% increase. Investors love Coca-Cola for its dependable growth and steady dividend payouts. Coca-Cola just raised its dividend for the 62nd consecutive year, offering a 3% yield \u2013 a rarity in today's market.\nUnlike the roller-coaster nature of tech, Coca-Cola's simpler, time-tested business model gives it a stability that's hard to beat. The company's revenue ticked up, with a 5.0% rise in the first nine months of 2024 alone and management projects 10% organic sales growth for the year \u2013 proof of the brand's staying power.\nRead Next:\n\u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Despite his preference for handwritten notes, Gates now relies on AI transcription and summary features integrated into Microsoft Teams. \u201cThe ability to interact and not just get the summary, but ask questions about the meeting, is pretty fantastic,\u201d Gates told The Verge.\n\nHis adoption reflects broader industry acceptance, with Gartner reporting that 75% of CEOs across industries have experimented with AI tools and 87% believe the benefits outweigh potential risks.\n\nFor Cook, AI integration is more than convenience. He places Apple Intelligence among the company\u2019s highest innovations, comparable to the iPhone\u2019s touch interface. \u201cI think we\u2019ll look back and it will be one of these air pockets that happened to get you on a different technology curve,\u201d he told the WSJ.\n\nCuban uses AI\u2019s utility beyond business, telling CNBC it is a tool to help review his children\u2019s homework assignments. Starting his day between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., Cook combines AI tools with traditional productivity methods, reviewing overnight sales reports alongside his AI-summarized emails.\nStory Continues\nSee Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nWhile Cook and Gates naturally discuss their companies\u2019 proprietary tools, the market offers numerous alternatives for email management and meeting documentation, making similar efficiency gains accessible across organizations.\nStill, their experiences suggest that AI adoption for routine tasks can create time savings when used correctly.\nThe trend suggests AI\u2019s role in business is evolving from experimental tech to essential productivity tools, with leaders actively integrating the solutions into their daily routines.\nRead Next:\nWith over 7.8K investors including Meta, Google, And Amazon Execs \u2014 this AI Startup's valuation has skyrocketed from $5 million to $85 million in just three years.

          "whole_article": "By Jody Godoy\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Apple asked a federal judge on Wednesday to dismiss the U.S. Department of Justice's case accusing the iPhone maker of unlawfully dominating the smartphone market, in the latest Big Tech antitrust showdown.\nU.S. District Judge Julien Neals in Newark, New Jersey, heard arguments from lawyers for Apple who said the government's case should be dismissed on multiple grounds and asked the judge to limit the discovery process. Discovery refers to the exchange of information among parties in a case.\n\"The government has failed to plausibly allege that Apple has monopoly power,\" said Apple lawyer Devora Allon.\nProsecutors are expected to say the company locks users in and keeps competition out by limiting interoperability between the iPhone and third-party apps and devices.\nApple has moved to dismiss the case, saying its limitations on developers' access to its technology were reasonable, and that forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation.\nAntitrust cases against Big Tech firms are a bipartisan trend. The case against Apple began during the first presidential term of Donald Trump and was filed during the administration of President Joe Biden.\nIn other cases, Alphabet's Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in online search, Meta Platforms faces trial on claims that it squelched competition by acquiring upstart rivals, and Amazon.com is fighting a case over its policies toward sellers and suppliers.\nBut some claims like the ones at the heart of the Apple case have ultimately failed.\nA judge dismissed the Federal Trade Commission's claim against Meta over the social-media platform's restrictions on third-party app developers.\nIn the Google search case, the judge rejected a claim that Google should have done more to accommodate advertisers on Microsoft's search engine Bing.\nApple cited the ruling in its own case, saying it shows that withholding access to technology should not be considered anticompetitive.\nThe Apple lawsuit filed in March by the DOJ and a coalition of states takes aim at restrictions and fees on app developers, and technical roadblocks to third-party devices and services - such as smart watches, digital wallets and messaging services - that would compete with its own.\nIf the judge finds the claims plausible, the case will be allowed to move forward.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York and David Shepardson in WashingtonEditing by Matthew Lewis and Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

In the first quarter, HarmonyOS overtook Apple's iOS to become the second-biggest mobile operating system in mainland China, according to Counterpoint Research.\nWhile strong iPhone 16 sales have lifted Apple back to second place in China's smartphone market in the third quarter, the company has yet to announce when it will bring its new in-app artificial intelligence function, Apple Intelligence, to users on the mainland, to the dismay of some local users.\nApple's app-store business model has come under increasing scrutiny around the world, with European regulators reportedly considering a fine on the company for restricting app developers from pointing users to payment options outside the US company's ecosystem.\nIn May, Apple won a landmark court case in Shanghai, filed by a local consumer who claimed that the company was abusing its market dominance by charging unfairly high commission fees.\nStory Continues\nHowever, Apple is still locked in a dispute with Chinese social media and video gaming giant Tencent Holdings. Players of WeChat mini games are currently able to top up credits using third-party payment services, allowing Tencent to circumvent Apple's typical 30 per cent commission cut. The US company has been asking Tencent to fix the loophole.\nTencent was negotiating with Apple regarding the sharing of revenue generated by WeChat mini games, the Chinese company's chief strategy officer James Mitchell said in an earnings call in August.\nThe report cited by Apple on Monday said that most Chinese developers do not have to pay App Store commissions.

          "whole_article": "The Justice Department apparently wants Google's empire to be broken up, but it has to convince a judge that should happen first.\nThe process starts Wednesday when US prosecutors are expected to submit a document in federal court outlining specific remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly.\nThe DOJ is expected to ask Google's parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) to sell off its Chrome browser, according to a report in Bloomberg. The Wall Street Journal reported that divestments could include the Android mobile operating system if Google doesn't meet certain conditions.\nProsecutors may also call for new data licensing requirements or an end to agreements that secure Google's search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.\nDOJ outlined a framework of options last month, but the filing Wednesday is expected to be a lot more specific about what it wants to happen.\nDOJ may ask for Google's empire to be broken up in a new document Wednesday. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\nIt will then be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ\u2019s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen next in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\nA DOJ breakup request would be the latest of many aggressive signals sent to the tech world during a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\"The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Yahoo Finance in an email.\n\"The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.\"\nIt is not yet known whether a new Trump administration would let all of those Big Tech antitrust cases continue.\nSome legal experts don't expect the crackdown to let up. After all, it was Trump's DOJ that initiated the antitrust suit against Google after it concluded the company used illegal tactics to monopolize search.\nBut Trump in October also suggested that Google\u2019s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview.\nStory Continues\nHe described Google\u2019s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nThe proposal to carve up Google would be the first step from the Justice Department to break apart a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOGL)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThat case resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.\nA DOJ request to divest part of Google\u2019s empire isn\u2019t surprising, according to Vanderbilt Law School associate dean for research Rebecca Allensworth, because \"it makes sense to ask for more than you are going to get.\"\nBut what she expects the judge to actually approve is data sharing as opposed to a spin-off of Chrome.\n\"We don\u2019t know what the judge is going to impose yet,\" she told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\nJean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine provider Brave, said a spin-off of Chrome is not likely to achieve the government's goals.\n\"My opinion is that if you have a browser \u2014 Safari, Firefox, Brave, whatever \u2014 and you send traffic to Google, then you should be compensated in a nondiscriminatory manner,\" Schmetz said.\n\"At the moment,\" Schmetz added, \"you only get money if you promise to Google that you're not going to compete against them.\"\nJudge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mark Wilson via Getty Images\nJudge Mehta has scheduled a remedies hearing to take place in April, and he has previously said he plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025.\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.\u2019s Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\nWhat is not yet known is how Trump\u2019s term, which starts Jan. 20, could alter how this case is resolved.\nGoogle is \"going to appeal this case,\" former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist Neil Chilson told Yahoo Finance. \"We are probably pretty far from any total final resolution.\"\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

Only Xiaomi did so last year, it noted.\nHuawei declined to comment. Apple and Xiaomi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nOverall, smartphone sales in China during the event, the country's biggest online shopping festival, fell 9% year-on-year as a slowing economy weighed on consumer enthusiasm despite the promotions, Counterpoint said.\nApple's Singles' Day performance underscores the growing competition it faces in the world's largest smartphone market, especially from Huawei which has come back strongly in the premium segment.\nThe U.S. tech giant has since responded with multiple discount campaigns to boost sales. Apple's iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max were the festival's best selling models, Counterpoint said.\nChina's e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and JD.com did not release sales figures for the festival, having dropped the practice in 2022, but Alibaba said Apple and Xiaomi were among brands that surpassed 1 billion yuan in gross merchandising value.\n(Reporting by Beijing newsroom and Brenda Goh.

With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) historically representing a substantial share of Qualcomm\u2019s revenue, the impact is expected to grow as the tech giant further reduces its reliance on third-party suppliers.\nThough Qualcomm is working to diversify its revenue streams as it prepares for the end of its lucrative partnership with Apple.\nThe company\u2019s QTL licensing business, however, is also showing signs of slowing. While the high-end smartphone market remains robust, future licensing gains are increasingly dependent on growth in the automotive and IoT sectors.\nDespite these challenges, Qualcomm\u2019s stock has risen about 14% this year. It was trading at $165 on Tuesday trading. The San Diego-based company remains the largest supplier of smartphone chips, benefiting from a recovery in the smartphone market as consumers upgrade devices for artificial intelligence applications like chatbots and image generators.\nEarlier this month, Qualcomm set its fiscal first-quarter revenue target at $10.9 billion, with projected earnings per share of $2.95. The period includes the holiday shopping season in key markets such as the U.S. and Europe, signaling optimism about near-term demand despite looming headwinds.\nRelated Articles\nQualcomm downgraded as Apple split and licensing woes loom\nProminent Wall Street boss Lutnick has been one of Trump's biggest cheerleaders\nS&P 500, Nasdaq gain with Nvidia; Walmart jumps after forecast\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's \"easy\" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some \"serious gains.\"\n\"I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It\u2019s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don\u2019t count. But that, people, is nonsense.\"\nCramer said banks do not \"care\" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.\n\"I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I\u2019m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.\"\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks.\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\nJim Cramer in a latest program explained why he's bullish on Amazon.\nStory Continues\n\"The catalyst for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is that they are crushing it this holiday season. These guys are doing so many things right. That last quarter was tremendous. But the key is Europe. That\u2019s the delta that\u2019s going to move it higher.\"\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0threw it out of the park with its latest quarterly results amid strong Cloud growth. Amazon Web Services has generated $27.5 billion in revenue, marking a 19% year-over-year increase. The segment\u2019s operating income is expanding at nearly 2.5 times the rate of its revenue growth, boosting Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s overall operating income. At this pace, AWS is on track to deliver $110 billion in annualized revenue. If it maintains its ~20% growth rate, AWS could reach $125-130 billion in revenue in FY 2025.\nFor the ongoing quarter, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) expects revenue between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, implying growth of up to 11%. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 32.9, higher than the big tech average of 25.5. If Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0grows its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 25% annually over the next three years, it could achieve an EPS of around $9.25 by FY 2027 (up from an estimated $4.74 in FY 2024). Applying a 35x P/E ratio in line with Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) historical average suggests a fair stock value of over $300. The primary catalyst for this target would be AWS\u2019s robust operating income growth.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest absolute detractors were Alphabet, Airbnb, and\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon\u2019s position as a notable detractor speaks more to the size of the position than the magnitude of the underperformance, as the company delivered a solid set of results during the quarter.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

BABA\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 22.94 and 10.27 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nInformatica (NYSE:INFA) Enhances Enterprise AI with GenAI Blueprints, Supporting Seamless Integration Across Leading Cloud Platforms\nA computer engineer seated in front of several connected consoles, illustrating the depth of cloud services offered by the company.\nAlibaba (BABA) is not just a leading e-commerce player; its cloud division, Alibaba Cloud, is becoming a dominant force in the rapidly expanding cloud market in Asia. As the number one cloud provider in the Asia-Pacific region, with nearly 40% market share, Alibaba Cloud is uniquely positioned to capture the region's massive growth, which is expected to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4% by 2028. While its Western counterparts, Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure, are major players globally, Alibaba\u2019s stronghold in Asia and its tailored approach to local markets set it apart. Countries like China, Indonesia, and Malaysia rely heavily on Alibaba Cloud for their digital transformation, with the company continuing to innovate through proprietary AI solutions like QWEN, which rivals OpenAI's GPT in several areas.\nThe cloud market in Asia is still in the early stages of penetration, offering Alibaba a long runway for growth. The region\u2019s cloud market, which was worth $120 billion in 2023, is expected to more than double by 2028, far outpacing the U.S. market. Alibaba\u2019s infrastructure, covering 28 global regions and over 90 availability zones, gives it an edge in this fast-growing sector, especially as increasing internet adoption, the rollout of 5G, and government incentives drive cloud demand. Alibaba Cloud\u2019s growth is increasingly becoming a major profit engine for the company, much like Amazon\u2019s AWS. While Alibaba\u2019s cloud division is not yet as profitable as AWS, its margins are improving, and the rise in AI-driven demand for compute resources positions it to capture a significant share of this opportunity.\nDespite facing regulatory challenges in China, Alibaba Cloud benefits from a favorable environment. The Chinese government promotes Alibaba Cloud\u2019s adoption as part of its national digital strategy, further solidifying its position in the market. Moreover, Alibaba Cloud is expanding internationally, with new data centers being developed in Mexico, expanding its reach beyond Asia.\nValuation-wise, Alibaba is significantly undervalued compared to its Western counterparts. With a price-to-earnings ratio of just 10x, compared to 34x for Microsoft and 62x for Amazon, Alibaba presents an attractive investment opportunity, especially given its cloud revenue growth rate of 30% in Asia. This discount is largely attributed to ongoing concerns over China\u2019s regulatory environment, but for investors who believe in the long-term growth of cloud computing in Asia, this presents a rare value opportunity.\nStory Continues\nIn addition to the cloud division\u2019s growth prospects, Alibaba\u2019s stock is buoyed by a $25 billion buyback program, signaling the company\u2019s commitment to returning value to shareholders. There is also speculation that Alibaba Cloud could eventually be spun off, potentially unlocking massive value for investors, much like AWS did for Amazon. With an upside potential of 30% in the base case and 70% in the bull case, Alibaba presents an exceptional risk/reward opportunity. However, risks remain, particularly from regulatory pressures in China. Nonetheless, as the company continues to leverage its strong position in Asia\u2019s booming cloud market, Alibaba\u2019s stock is poised for significant upside in the coming years.\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is on our list of the\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 91 hedge fund portfolios held BABA at the end of the second quarter which was 103 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks you might have recently missed.\nArtificial intelligence has been making headlines even at political summits. For example, news agency Xinhua recently reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro recently, warning that artificial intelligence should not be a game of rich countries and the wealthy. The Chinese president also called for more international governance and cooperation on AI. During another appearance, Xi also referred to increasing tariffs on Chinese goods, terming it protectionism in the name of green and low-carbon development. Xi said the world economy should be characterized by openness.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nMeanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has joined the transition team of San Francisco Mayor-elect Daniel Lurie following the US election. Per news agency Reuters, Altman joins a growing list of tech executives taking a position in government and said on the occasion that he is excited to help the city where the AI startup started its journey. Bilal Mahmood, who is on the city's board of supervisors, said that former business executives are experts in prioritization and metrics-driven governance, which can help the city return to the basics. He added that San Francisco's problems stem from its inefficient technical infrastructure, leading to delays in hiring and housing approvals, areas where tech executives are well-positioned to contribute.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\nMarket Capitalization: $2.1 Trillion\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. On November 18, the company revealed new research that detailed the impact of AI on holiday sales. Per the research, the small and medium-sized enterprises on Amazon that were embracing tools such as AI and data insights look set to capture a bigger slice of the sales pie during the holiday season as opposed to their counterparts who are not. Holiday period sales are critical to annual growth figures for many of these companies, the research further highlighted.\nOverall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you might have recently missed.

CART, Exelixis EXEL and Doximity DOCS.\nHunting for Earnings Beats? Try These 4 Top-Ranked Stocks\nIt is not surprising that before any earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality.\nIn this regard, we ran a screener that yielded stocks Amazon.com, Maplebear Inc., Exelixis and Doximity as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential.\nWhy Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?\nHistorically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn\u2019t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company\u2019s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\nOn the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies\u2019 financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company\u2019s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.\nThus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company\u2019s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.\nHow to Find Stocks that Can Beat?\nNow, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors\u2019 dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.\nAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company\u2019s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.\nHere are four out of 20 stocks:\nAmazon.com:The Zacks Rank #1 company is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nStory Continues\nThe average earnings surprise of AMZN for the past four quarters is 25.85%.\nMaplebear: Maplebear Inc. is a grocery technology company principally in North America that works with grocers and retailers to transform how people shop.

The Wall Street Journal reported that divestments could include the Android mobile operating system if Google doesn't meet certain conditions.\nProsecutors may also call for new data licensing requirements or an end to agreements that secure Google's search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.\nDOJ outlined a framework of options last month, but the filing Wednesday is expected to be a lot more specific about what it wants to happen.\nDOJ may ask for Google's empire to be broken up in a new document Wednesday. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\nIt will then be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ\u2019s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen next in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\nA DOJ breakup request would be the latest of many aggressive signals sent to the tech world during a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\"The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Yahoo Finance in an email.\n\"The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.\"\nIt is not yet known whether a new Trump administration would let all of those Big Tech antitrust cases continue.\nSome legal experts don't expect the crackdown to let up. After all, it was Trump's DOJ that initiated the antitrust suit against Google after it concluded the company used illegal tactics to monopolize search.\nBut Trump in October also suggested that Google\u2019s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview.\nStory Continues\nHe described Google\u2019s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nThe proposal to carve up Google would be the first step from the Justice Department to break apart a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOGL)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThat case resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.\nA DOJ request to divest part of Google\u2019s empire isn\u2019t surprising, according to Vanderbilt Law School associate dean for research Rebecca Allensworth, because \"it makes sense to ask for more than you are going to get.\"\nBut what she expects the judge to actually approve is data sharing as opposed to a spin-off of Chrome.\n\"We don\u2019t know what the judge is going to impose yet,\" she told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\nJean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine provider Brave, said a spin-off of Chrome is not likely to achieve the government's goals.\n\"My opinion is that if you have a browser \u2014 Safari, Firefox, Brave, whatever \u2014 and you send traffic to Google, then you should be compensated in a nondiscriminatory manner,\" Schmetz said.\n\"At the moment,\" Schmetz added, \"you only get money if you promise to Google that you're not going to compete against them.\"\nJudge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mark Wilson via Getty Images\nJudge Mehta has scheduled a remedies hearing to take place in April, and he has previously said he plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025.\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.\u2019s Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\nWhat is not yet known is how Trump\u2019s term, which starts Jan. 20, could alter how this case is resolved.\nGoogle is \"going to appeal this case,\" former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist Neil Chilson told Yahoo Finance. \"We are probably pretty far from any total final resolution.\"\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks that are worthy of investor attention.\nThe advent of artificial intelligence has shaken up the Search business on the internet, a domain where Google has long reigned supreme. With AI models from startups like OpenAI, companies are offering natural language search capabilities to users that are cutting away Google's dominance in the Search market. Latest reports from news publication Bloomberg suggest that Google now faces added pressure with authorities in the US reportedly pushing the firm to spin off its Chrome browser business. The report further claims that authorities are also planning to recommend to a federal judge that Google face antitrust requirements related to AI and its Android mobile operating system.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe measures are a byproduct of a multilayer case that the Justice Department has built against Google. The government won the first round in the case earlier this year, which sought to prove that the tech giant has a web search monopoly in the US. In the ruling on this case, federal judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets. Per the Justice Department, the case against Chrome stems from the fact that the browser is a key access point through which many people use Google Search.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\nFox Corporation and Netflix are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FOX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nFOX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.71, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 44.06. We also note that FOX has a PEG ratio of 1.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.68.\nAnother notable valuation metric for FOX is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 16.39.\nBased on these metrics and many more, FOX holds a Value grade of A, while NFLX has a Value grade of D.\nFOX sticks out from NFLX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FOX is the better option right now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX).\nNetflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.91, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.91 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.1% and 4.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NFLX\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Netflix, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NFLX a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $19.78.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Netflix.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\nSee our latest analysis for Netflix\nHow Fast Is Netflix Growing?\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, Netflix has grown EPS by 17% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Netflix is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 7.3 percentage points to 26%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Netflix's forecast profits?\nAre Netflix Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nSince Netflix has a market capitalisation of US$352b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$2.1b. We note that this amounts to 0.6% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Netflix but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\nDoes Netflix Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\nAs previously touched on, Netflix is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together.\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\nCramer likes Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) but mentioned the constant increase in stock price because of a stream of analyst price target increases.\n\u201c[The] second group that's getting maybe too much love: This market is nuts for subscription products. I like these stocks too\u2026 They all have huge recurring revenue streams and membership dues, and their stocks are huge winners. All these are benefiting from endless positive research calls, they just appear each morning as if by magic. Netflix has the most fanboys and analysts will come out and raise its price target based on the new ad model, which is going so well. Then the stock goes higher, and then another analyst will come out the next day and raise her price target for the same reason. It just won't stop, always on the same piece of information. That is not cricket.\u201d\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a leading global provider of streaming entertainment, offering a vast array of movies, TV shows, and original content to millions of subscribers worldwide. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported a strong financial performance, with revenue growing by 15%, driven primarily by a 14% increase in its subscriber base. A key factor contributing to this growth is the rise in subscription prices, particularly in its core markets of the U.S. and Canada, where users are now paying an average of 5% more than the previous year.\nAs of September 30, the company's subscriber count reached an impressive 283 million, a number that continues to climb each quarter. Spencer Neumann, the company\u2019s CFO, noted that there are still \"hundreds of millions of households that aren't members,\" suggesting significant potential for further growth. Looking ahead, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is projecting between $6 billion and $6.5 billion in free cash flow for fiscal year 2024.\nOverall NFLX ranks 4th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

It alluded to the technical problems in an Instagram post, saying the event \"even had our buffering systems on the ropes.\"\nBut it's not the first time Netflix has faced technical glitches from its various live events, which have included comedy specials and reunion tapings. That's led to investor concerns the company won't be able to get things right in time for its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans.\nMultiple users on social media platforms vented their frustrations, explicitly calling out the streaming issues and disruptions throughout the night.\nStill, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein shrugged off the customer complaints, writing in a note to clients on Sunday that viewing was likely twice as large as the company's internal expectations, \"a high quality problem than can be easily fixed by Christmas Day.\"\nNetflix inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nLate Sunday, the company announced Beyonc\u00e9 as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show. It will be the first time the artist will perform her Grammy-nominated album \"Cowboy Cater\" live.\nStory Continues\nNetflix's advertising focus\nWorrisome glitches? Customers complained that the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson stream was problematic. (AP Foto/Julio Cortez) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nAssuming 2.5 viewers per household, Helfstein estimated about 150 million global viewers tuned in to watch the Tyson-Paul event. That's greater than the 124 million US viewers who watched the 2024 Super Bowl, the highest viewership for any US broadcast.\nThe analyst, who has an Outperform rating on shares, called out Netflix's ability to generate massive viewership, \"suggesting the company will be successful with advertising around live events.\"\nLast week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.\nOf note: Monthly active users, otherwise known as MAUs, are not the same as paying subscribers. The company has yet to reveal actual subscriber figures for the ad tier or how much revenue it's generated so far. MAUs can include multiple people using the same account.\nNetflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.\nStill, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat \u2014 a potential headwind when it comes to the company's ability to raise prices and boost growth.\n\"With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.\nValuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock \"is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025.\" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Most of these startups are software companies working on expanding AI use cases. In the midst of this AI boom, BrightAI, an AI startup that focuses on the physical aspect of the AI business, is now making waves on Wall Street. Founded by Alex Hawkinson, an entrepreneur and investor with a proven track record in the tech world, the company offers an end-to-end tech platform that uses sensors to help companies monitor physical assets.

Since then, the firm has managed to attract seven large enterprise customers across six verticals, including HVAC, waste management, and power. It has deployed more than 250,000 sensors and has reached $80 million in revenue. These figures are impressive since the startup managed to do this without raising any outside capital. However, the firm is now looking to expand and recently raised more than $15 million in a funding round led exclusively by Los Angeles-based Upfront Ventures.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

He named several team members who have been at the company since the very beginning.\nHe said that if you surround yourself with people who share the same mindset, you can get through the tough times. However, you still have to trick yourself every day into thinking it\u2019s not as hard as it really is.\n\u201cI\u2019m surrounded by these people that never one time gave up and they never one time gave up on me.

          "whole_article": "What's Going On With Broadcom (AVGO) Stock?\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nAs NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market\u2014and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nWhat To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry.\nBroadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers\u2014critical components for Nvidia\u2019s AI-focused operations.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nA strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.\nHistorically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s during major market reactions. Nvidia\u2019s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.\nHow To Buy AVGO Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\nStory Continues\nCheck It Out:\nArrived Achieved A Total Return of 34.7% On Their Biggest Sale Yet \u2014 Diversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio.\nIn October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- With Nvidia Corp. due to report an unusually complex quarter as the world\u2019s most valuable company, traders are preparing for a potentially mammoth stock swing.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nParis to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees\nTrump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy\nNew York\u2019s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll\nTokyo\u2019s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\nNY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here\u2019s What Could Kill It\nThe options-implied move for Nvidia shares the day after earnings is about 8% in either direction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would equate to close to a $300 billion swing in market value \u2014 bigger than all but 25 companies in the S&P 500 Index. And according to strategists at Bank of America, the report carries more risk for the benchmark than the next Federal Reserve meeting or inflation data.\nAs the poster child of the artificial intelligence trade, Nvidia\u2019s stock has rallied nearly 200% so far in 2024 and its reports have been the biggest event on the earnings calendar for more than a year. The shares fell 1.9% on Wednesday ahead of the chipmaker\u2019s fiscal third quarter earnings, due after markets close, and there\u2019s more uncertainty than normal about how the results and guidance will play out.\nThat\u2019s because there are varying views on Wall Street about what to expect from the company\u2019s newest product line, Blackwell. Nvidia has said that the new chips will contribute several billion dollars in revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, while Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang described demand for the chips as \u201cinsane.\u201d But production delays have made modeling supply \u2014 a notoriously difficult task \u2014 even harder.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big unknown around Blackwell capacity,\u201d said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group. \u201cThe CEO has established a lot of credibility, but the bar is very high,\u201d he said, adding that it will likely be challenging for Nvidia to give blowout guidance for next quarter.\nThe questions around Blackwell have led to a wide spread in analyst expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter that ends in January. Consensus is at $37.1 billion \u2014 with the gap between the highest and lowest projections at more than $7 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia typically provides revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter with its results.\nPart of the reason for the gap in analyst forecasts is that some expect customers to delay purchases of Blackwell\u2019s predecessor products, called Hopper, in anticipation of the newer chips.\nStory Continues\nThat\u2019s what Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore is anticipating and why he\u2019s calling Wednesday\u2019s results a \u201ctransitional\u201d quarter. Nvidia is likely to give a conservative forecast that\u2019s only slightly ahead of the average analyst estimate, which should satisfy most investors as long as everything points to a very strong full-year Blackwell ramp, Moore wrote.\nJim Worden, chief investment officer of Wealth Consulting Group, is also less concerned about the timing of Blackwell, with all signs pointing to strong demand.\n\u201cI expect we\u2019ll see a very good showing with Blackwell and how much it is shipping,\u201d he said. \u201cThat trend should continue on into next year.\u201d\nThe chipmaker\u2019s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., all pledged in their most recent results to pump more into capital spending in the year ahead.\nHowever, with a history of beating estimates in a big way, thanks to unbridled demand for its accelerator chips, Nvidia may need to do more than provide assurances that Blackwell\u2019s ramp up remains strong. In the past five quarters, Nvidia sales have beaten consensus by an average of about $1.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nIf Nvidia results fall short of that bar, it could spell trouble for the stock, which is trading close to a record high.\n\u201cThe stock could be volatile, even on a really good report,\u201d Worden said. The market may be expecting perfection, \u201cand to the extent it isn\u2019t perfect, the stock could pull back.\u201d\nRick Bensignor, chief executive officer of Bensignor Investment Strategies and a former Morgan Stanley strategist, agrees.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t just beat the consensus, but also the whisper-type numbers that people are looking for,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it disappoints, we can easily see it come off 10% or so.\u201d\nFor the broader market, the implications of Nvidia\u2019s results might not have been fully priced in, said Charlie McElligott, Nomura\u2019s cross asset strategist at Nomura. Option straddles on the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF are only implying a 1.7% move for Thursday. \u201cThat maybe \u2018feels\u2019 light,\u201d McElligott wrote.\nTop Tech Stories\nComcast Corp. plans to spin off cable-TV channels including MSNBC, CNBC and USA, according a person a familiar with the company\u2019s plans, reducing its exposure to a business that\u2019s losing viewers and advertisers.\nSpaceX achieved new feats during the sixth major test launch of its Starship system but nixed an eagerly anticipated midair \u201ccatch\u201d of the rocket\u2019s booster as President-elect Donald Trump looked on in South Texas.\nHuawei Technologies Co.\u2019s ambitions to create more powerful chips for AI and smartphones have hit major snags because of US sanctions, stalling a major Chinese effort to match American technology.\nQualcomm Inc., the world\u2019s biggest seller of smartphone processors, is expecting its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2029.\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s Chrome browser could go for as much as $20 billion if a judge agrees to a Justice Department proposal to sell the business, in what would be a historic crackdown on one of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies.\nSemiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.\u2019s stock has more than doubled over the past two months on an expected boost from China\u2019s self-reliance push, even amid risks tied to competition and geopolitical tensions.\nEarnings Due Thursday\nPremarket\nWix.com\nPostmarket\nNvidia\nPalo Alto Networks\nSnowflake\nVnet Group\n--With assistance from Matt Turner, Subrat Patnaik, Jan-Patrick Barnert and Brandon Harden.\n(Updates Wednesday trading in third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nJaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers\nTrump\u2019s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires\nTrump and the Triumph of America\u2019s New Elite\nCompanies With Immigrant Workforces Are Preparing for Raids\nDeep in the Jungle, Virus Hunters Are Working to Stop the Next Pandemic\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

That includes developing AI agents and training the firm's workforce to become proficient with the technology.\nWhile Wall Street waits on the technology industry to demonstrate returns commensurate with the billions in capital expenditure it is pouring into AI, professional services providers have become one of the first business beneficiaries of the technology as large businesses tap accounting and consulting firms for help on implementing AI inside their companies and product offerings.\n\"We strongly are in the camp that it is moving from [proof of concept] and experimentation to scaling,\" Chase said. \"We believe that professional services is going through the largest transformation that it will likely ever go through.\"\nHe cited a KPMG poll of business leaders, which found that about 50% of surveyed organizations planned to spend $100 million on AI initiatives over the next 12 months, and about 20% planned to spend at least $250 million.\nBookings for KPMG's Google Cloud-related services have grown 10-fold over the last two years, Chase said.\nIn keeping with clients' demands, KPMG is spreading its bets across cloud providers. In July 2023, the firm announced a $2 billion commitment across five years to expand AI and cloud services via Microsoft.\nGoogle's president of revenue for its cloud division, Matt Renner, told Reuters the company is emphasizing partnering with consulting firms as part of its cloud growth strategy. The company's third-quarter earnings beat in October was driven in part by a 35% boost in cloud sales.\nRenner predicted that the three major cloud companies \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft and Google \u2014 and most professional services firms would continue to \"grow pretty exponentially together.\"\nChase declined to share how much KPMG has invested into its Google Cloud practice to date, but said Wednesday's tranche was the \"largest direct investment commitment\" with Google so far.\n\"We anticipate making additional announcements about additional investments in this area,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Leslie Adler)\nView Comments"

When consumers use our services, they expect their data to be protected. We will not compromise that trust in order to give competitors more access to sensitive data,\" a Google spokesperson said.\nThe Commission declined to comment on DuckDuckgo's allegations, saying it was fully committed to ensuring the implementation and enforcement of the DMA.\nBazbaz said one investigation should target Google's proposal to license anonymised search data to rivals directed at European users, saying this data set likely excludes 99% of search queries, effectively making it useless to competitors.\n\"Google is trying to avoid its legal obligation in the name of privacy, which is ironic coming from the Internet's biggest tracker,\" Bazbaz said.\nHe said Google should also be investigated for allegedly failing to comply with the DMA obligations to allow users to easily switch to rival search engines.\nIf companies are found to have breached the DMA it can cost them as much as 10% of their global annual turnover.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey, Alexander Smith, Alexandra Hudson)"

In September, Trump said he would prosecute Google for what he perceives as bias against him. But a month later, Trump questioned whether breaking up the company was a good idea.\nOnce in office, Trump will be able to appoint a new head of the DOJ's antitrust division who will have authority to change strategy, negotiate settlements, or withdraw from cases entirely. Trump has yet to announce a pick to helm the agency.\nGoogle plans to appeal once U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta makes a final ruling, which he is likely to do by August 2025.\nGoogle will have a chance to make its own proposal in December.\nMehta has scheduled a trial on the proposals for April. Whether Trump and the DOJ's next antitrust head will step in and change course in the case before then remains to be seen.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

The Wall Street Journal reported that divestments could include the Android mobile operating system if Google doesn't meet certain conditions.\nProsecutors may also call for new data licensing requirements or an end to agreements that secure Google's search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.\nDOJ outlined a framework of options last month, but the filing Wednesday is expected to be a lot more specific about what it wants to happen.\nDOJ may ask for Google's empire to be broken up in a new document Wednesday. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\nIt will then be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ\u2019s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen next in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\nA DOJ breakup request would be the latest of many aggressive signals sent to the tech world during a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\"The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Yahoo Finance in an email.\n\"The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.\"\nIt is not yet known whether a new Trump administration would let all of those Big Tech antitrust cases continue.\nSome legal experts don't expect the crackdown to let up. After all, it was Trump's DOJ that initiated the antitrust suit against Google after it concluded the company used illegal tactics to monopolize search.\nBut Trump in October also suggested that Google\u2019s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview.\nStory Continues\nHe described Google\u2019s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nThe proposal to carve up Google would be the first step from the Justice Department to break apart a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOGL)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThat case resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.\nA DOJ request to divest part of Google\u2019s empire isn\u2019t surprising, according to Vanderbilt Law School associate dean for research Rebecca Allensworth, because \"it makes sense to ask for more than you are going to get.\"\nBut what she expects the judge to actually approve is data sharing as opposed to a spin-off of Chrome.\n\"We don\u2019t know what the judge is going to impose yet,\" she told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\nJean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine provider Brave, said a spin-off of Chrome is not likely to achieve the government's goals.\n\"My opinion is that if you have a browser \u2014 Safari, Firefox, Brave, whatever \u2014 and you send traffic to Google, then you should be compensated in a nondiscriminatory manner,\" Schmetz said.\n\"At the moment,\" Schmetz added, \"you only get money if you promise to Google that you're not going to compete against them.\"\nJudge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.\u2019s Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\nWhat is not yet known is how Trump\u2019s term, which starts Jan. 20, could alter how this case is resolved.\nGoogle is \"going to appeal this case,\" former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist Neil Chilson told Yahoo Finance. \"We are probably pretty far from any total final resolution.\"\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.\nWhen it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there\u2019s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University\u2019s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).\nFounded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university\u2019s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard\u2019s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard\u2019s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university\u2019s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard\u2019s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.\nAccording to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. \u201cNarv\u201d Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia\u2019s 11.5% or Brown\u2019s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC\u2019s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:\n\u201cIn FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC\u2019s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.\u201d\nNotably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from \"overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500.\" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar\u2019s strategy of overhauling the university\u2019s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Harvard Management Company\u2019s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported its third-quarter results for fiscal 2024. The company saw a 15% year-over-year increase in consolidated revenue, reaching $88.3 billion. A key driver of this growth was the Google Cloud segment, which includes Google Workspace. Revenue from Google Cloud surged 35% year-over-year, primarily fueled by AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions within Cloud Platform services.\nBMO Capital Markets raised its price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0to $217 from $215, maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock. This adjustment reflects the company\u2019s strong performance across its business segments. BMO\u2019s analysis noted the acceleration in Alphabet\u2019s cloud revenue and highlighted the company\u2019s successful search monetization efforts. Additionally, the growth of AI Overview Ads on mobile is expected to drive further expansion, with a global rollout anticipated after 2025.\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund (Hedged) stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Chrome browser could go for as much as $20 billion if a judge agrees to a Justice Department proposal to sell the business, in what would be a historic crackdown on one of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nParis to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees\nTrump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy\nNew York\u2019s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll\nTokyo\u2019s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\nNY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here\u2019s What Could Kill It\nThe department will ask the judge, who ruled in August that Google illegally monopolized the search market, to require measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system, according to people familiar with the plans.\nAntitrust officials, along with states that have joined the case, also plan to recommend Wednesday that federal judge Amit Mehta impose data licensing requirements, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.\nIf Mehta accepts the proposals, they have the potential to reshape the online search market and the burgeoning AI industry. The case was filed under the first Trump administration and continued under President Joe Biden. It marks the most aggressive effort to rein in a technology company since Washington unsuccessfully sought to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago.\nOwning the world\u2019s most popular web browser is key for Google\u2019s ads business. The company is able to see activity from signed-in users, and use that data to more effectively target promotions, which generate the bulk of its revenue. Google has also been using Chrome to direct users to its flagship AI product, Gemini, which has the potential to evolve from an answer-bot to an assistant that follows users around the web.\nShould a sale proceed, Chrome would be worth \u201cat least $15-$20 billion, given it has over 3 billion monthly active users,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh.\nThe price prospective buyers are willing to pay may depend on their ability to link Chrome to other services, said Bob O\u2019Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. \u201cIt\u2019s not directly monetizable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt serves as a gateway to other things. It\u2019s not clear how you measure that from a pure revenue-generating perspective.\u201d\nLee-Anne Mulholland, Google\u2019s vice president of regulatory affairs, said the Justice Department \u201ccontinues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case.\u201d She added, \u201cthe government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.\u201d\nStory Continues\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\nChrome Access\nAntitrust enforcers want the judge to order Google to sell off Chrome because, as the most widely used browser worldwide, it represents a key access point through which many people use its search engine, the people said.\nThe government has the option to decide whether a Chrome sale is necessary at a later date if some of the other aspects of the remedy do not create a more competitive market, the people added. The Chrome browser controls about 61% of the market in the US, according to StatCounter, a web traffic analytics service.\nGovernment attorneys met with dozens of companies over the past three months as they prepared the recommendation. States are still considering adding some proposals and some details could change, the people said.\nThe antitrust officials pulled back from a more severe option that would have forced Google to sell off Android, the people said.\nAlphabet\u2019s Google Bracing for Antitrust Rigmarole: Legal Outlook\nThe benefit of Chrome, which Google doesn\u2019t charge for directly, is partially in the convenience it provides users, by making their experience with Google products more seamless, said Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, on CNBC. \u201cBreaking up these companies is not going to fundamentally address the annoyance you have with them.\u201d\nGoogle said in a blog post that if other companies owned Chrome, they wouldn\u2019t have the incentive to invest as heavily in it or keep it free, and would likely have to change its business model.\nGoogle Appeal\nMehta\u2019s August ruling that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets followed a 10-week trial last year. The company has said it plans to appeal.\nThe judge has set a two-week hearing in April on what changes Google must make to remedy the illegal behavior and plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025.\nThe agency and the states have settled on recommending that Google be required to license the results and data from its popular search engine and give websites more options to prevent their content from being used by Google\u2019s artificial intelligence products, said the people.\nThe antitrust enforcers are set to propose that Google uncouple its Android smartphone operating system from its other products, including search and its Google Play mobile app store, which are now sold as a bundle, the people said. They are also prepared to seek a requirement that Google share more information with advertisers and give them more control over where their ads appear.\nLawyers from the Justice Department and state attorneys general included all of those options in an initial filing in October, as well as a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of the case against Google.\nA forced spinoff, if it happens, would also hinge on finding an interested buyer. Those who could afford and might want the property, like Amazon.com Inc., are also facing antitrust scrutiny that may prevent such a mega-deal.\n\u201cMy view is this is extremely unlikely,\u201d Singh said in an email. But, he added, he could see a buyer like OpenAI, the maker of artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. \u201cThat would give it both distribution and an ads business to complement its consumer chatbot subscriptions.\u201d\nA merger with a US-based AI player may more easily pass government scrutiny than another tech giant, said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, digital advertising and media analyst at Emarketer. It \u201ccould conceivably be approved by the government as a way to prioritize AI innovation and US posturing around AI on the global stage.\u201d\nAI Overviews\nGoogle now displays artificial intelligence-based answers at the top of its search pages billed as \u201cAI Overviews.\u201d While websites can opt-out of having their information used by Google to create AI models, they can\u2019t afford to opt out of the overviews because that would risk pushing them down in search results, making it harder to reach their customers.\nWebsite publishers have complained that the feature dampens traffic and advertising dollars since users rarely click through to see the data being used to power those results.\nEarlier: Google\u2019s AI Search Gives Sites Dire Choice: Share Data or Die\nRegarding data licensing, the antitrust enforcers plan to propose two options: That Google sell the underlying \u201cclick and query\u201d data and also separately syndicate its search results, according to the people.\nThe company currently sells syndicated search results, but with restrictions, such as preventing their use on mobile. Forcing Google to syndicate its search results would allow rival search engines and AI startups to quickly improve their quality, while the data feed would allow others to build their own search index.\n--With assistance from Nick Turner, Davey Alba and Julia Love.\n(Updates with price analysis in the seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nJaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers\nTrump\u2019s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires\nTrump and the Triumph of America\u2019s New Elite\nCompanies With Immigrant Workforces Are Preparing for Raids\nDeep in the Jungle, Virus Hunters Are Working to Stop the Next Pandemic\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a top pick for Goldman Sachs, which sees significant upside in the company's stock.\nIn a client note released Wednesday, equity analyst Kash Rangan described Microsoft as \"one of the most compelling investment opportunities\" in the tech space, citing its robust position across the cloud stack and growing momentum in artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe investment bank maintained its Buy rating on the stock, setting a 12-month price target of $500. This projection suggests a 20% upside from Microsoft\u2019s current price levels, driven by anticipated growth across its cloud and AI offerings.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nMicrosoft Positioned For Long-Term Secular Trends\nRangan emphasized Microsoft\u2019s dominant presence across the entire cloud stack, from applications to infrastructure.\n\u201cWith a strong presence across all layers of the cloud stack, Microsoft is well-positioned, in our view, to capitalize on a number of long-term secular trends, such as Gen-AI, public cloud consumption, SaaS adoption, and digital transformation,\u201d Rangan stated.\nHe highlighted these trends could drive sustainable growth, supported by Microsoft's ability to integrate its services seamlessly across its ecosystem.\nMicrosoft already built a competitive edge in the generative AI market through its Azure cloud platform.\nAccording to Rangan, AI workloads are growing more complex, with 93% of use cases relying on three or more model providers. Microsoft's efforts to mitigate these challenges, including the development of custom chips and advanced hardware, position it as a leader in the AI infrastructure space.\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before it closes TONIGHT.\nAzure Innovations and Adoption Drive Growth\nGoldman Sachs sees Azure's custom silicon as a game changer in tackling the increasing demand for AI processing power. \"Azure's custom chips extend GPU architecture and alleviate capacity constraints,\" Rangan stated.\nStory Continues\nKey innovations such as Azure Cobalt \u2014 delivering a 50% improvement in price performance \u2014 and Azure Boost DPU \u2014 cutting server power usage by threefold while quadrupling performance \u2014 offer a strong value proposition.\nAzure AI services are also gaining traction, with offerings like the AI Foundry (currently in preview), AI Agent Service (coming soon), and Copilot Studio (already used by over 100,000 organizations).\nUsage of Azure OpenAI Services has doubled in just six months, which, according to Rangan, demonstrates customers' growing ability to deploy real-world AI applications.\nStock Struggles While Azure Deceleration\nDespite Microsoft's strong innovation pipeline, its stock has underperformed the Nasdaq by eight percentage points since reporting fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results. Slowing Azure growth has weighed on investor sentiment.\nYet, Rangan expects Azure's reacceleration in fiscal third-quarter 2025 to serve as the next major catalyst for the stock rebound.\nMicrosoft's commercial Office offerings also provide a significant growth lever. The analyst indicated that the platform boasts over 400 million commercial users, representing less than 50% of the global knowledge workforce, suggesting further expansion potential.\nExpansive TAM and Secular Tailwinds\nAccording to the investment bank, Microsoft stands out due to its expansive total addressable market (TAM) and the company's ability to capitalize on secular tailwinds like cloud adoption and digital transformation.\n\u201cWhile MSFT competes with a number of best-of-breed and platform providers across various layers of the tech stack, we believe the company's breadth of offerings and large installed base position the company to expand its share of wallet within customers' IT budgets,\u201d Rangan wrote.\nRead Next:\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

The Wall Street Journal reported that divestments could include the Android mobile operating system if Google doesn't meet certain conditions.\nProsecutors may also call for new data licensing requirements or an end to agreements that secure Google's search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.\nDOJ outlined a framework of options last month, but the filing Wednesday is expected to be a lot more specific about what it wants to happen.\nDOJ may ask for Google's empire to be broken up in a new document Wednesday. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\nIt will then be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ\u2019s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen next in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\nA DOJ breakup request would be the latest of many aggressive signals sent to the tech world during a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\"The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Yahoo Finance in an email.\n\"The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.\"\nIt is not yet known whether a new Trump administration would let all of those Big Tech antitrust cases continue.\nSome legal experts don't expect the crackdown to let up. After all, it was Trump's DOJ that initiated the antitrust suit against Google after it concluded the company used illegal tactics to monopolize search.\nBut Trump in October also suggested that Google\u2019s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview.\nStory Continues\nHe described Google\u2019s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nThe proposal to carve up Google would be the first step from the Justice Department to break apart a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).\n\u2022 USD\n(GOOGL)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThat case resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.\nA DOJ request to divest part of Google\u2019s empire isn\u2019t surprising, according to Vanderbilt Law School associate dean for research Rebecca Allensworth, because \"it makes sense to ask for more than you are going to get.\"\nBut what she expects the judge to actually approve is data sharing as opposed to a spin-off of Chrome.\n\"We don\u2019t know what the judge is going to impose yet,\" she told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\nJean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine provider Brave, said a spin-off of Chrome is not likely to achieve the government's goals.\n\"My opinion is that if you have a browser \u2014 Safari, Firefox, Brave, whatever \u2014 and you send traffic to Google, then you should be compensated in a nondiscriminatory manner,\" Schmetz said.\n\"At the moment,\" Schmetz added, \"you only get money if you promise to Google that you're not going to compete against them.\"\nJudge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves right now.\nWith Donald Trump having won the elections, it seems Elon Musk is going to be a powerful force in the administration.\u00a0 After all, X CEO has played an outsized role in his comeback, contributing millions to his campaign, serving as policy advisor, and even using his social media platform as a Make America Great Again (MAGA) advocacy platform.\nNow that his efforts have come to fruition Max Tegmark, a leading scientist, who has previously worked with the world\u2019s richest person says Musk\u2019s influence could lead to tougher safety standards for artificial intelligence, as reported by The Guardian.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Stories Shaking Up Wall Street\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nTegmark says Musk\u2019s backing of a failed AI bill demonstrated that Musk is still worried about the repercussions of uncontrolled AI development. The SB 1047 bill in California required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them.\nHaving frequently warned that such an unrestrained development can be catastrophic for humanity, Musk was one of the 30,000 others who had signed a letter calling for a pause on the development of advanced AI technology last year.\nAccording to Tegmark, Musk could convince Trump to introduce standards that prevent the growth of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a term used for AI systems that match or surpass human levels of intelligence.\n\u201cI do think that if Elon manages to get Trump\u2019s ear on AI issues we\u2019re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI. He might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.\u201d\nBefore Trump won the elections, Musk had predicted the development of artificial intelligence that would be smarter than the smartest human being by next year or by 2026.\n\"If you define AGI (artificial general intelligence) as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably next year, within two years\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nMarket Capitalization: $84.07 billion\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity technology company that uses artificial intelligence to automate and improve cyber protection, learning from more than 2 trillion incidents every day to enhance accuracy.\nOn Monday, November 18, Truist raised the firm\u2019s price target on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) to $375 from $325 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The analyst, rating the stock as part of a broader research note previewing Q3 results for the Infrastructure & Security Software names, notes that buyer behavior has been stabilizing and the firm is focused on visibility into 2025 when generative AI projects will have a \u201crubber meets the road\u201d moment. In particular, the firm believes that Crowdstrike\u2019s recent challenges, especially its global IT outage on July 19th, may lead to lower upsell revenue. There may also be a greater-than-normal decrease in business/ revenue due to longer-than-usual subscription durations following its global IT outage.\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves right now.

This caused significant reputational damage to the cybersecurity leader, as the outage led to grounded flights, canceled medical procedures and widespread disruption. Following this incident, the stock took a sharp dive, dropping from $345 to $264 on July 22, as investors reacted to the news.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRWD.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nThe repercussions from the July 19 outage was revealed when the company reported its Q2 FY25 earnings. Despite the outage, the company managed to outperform wall-street analysts' revenue and earnings expectations, leading to a 3% stock price increase following the earnings release. However, with its Q2 FY25 earnings results, management released its lowered top-line and bottom-line guidance for the upcoming quarters. Despite this lowered guidance, the stock largely rebounded, and is now in line with the S&P 500's YTD returns. My long-term investment perspective for CrowdStrike lies on one key trend in cybersecurity: the growing demand from enterprise customers to consolidate multiple-vendor solutions onto a single platform to cut costs. Consequently, the recent macroeconomic pressures have forced enterprise customers to focus on efficiency and find ways to do more with less. Thus, this key trend remains strong and I believe CrowdStrike is well-positioned to benefit, as it provides one of the top platforms in the market at significant cost-savings.\nThe Falcon Platform: One-Stop Shop\nCrowdStrike is basically known as an endpoint protection company in the cybersecurity market, but I don't think this fully captures the scope of services that the company currently offers. In reality, it operates as a one-stop platform for enterprise cybersecurity solutions, which was a key point highlighted during its Q2 FY25 earnings presentation. While there are many competitors in the industry, no other competitor is able to offer the scope of services that CrowdStrike does. Thus, as mentioned previously, I believe that CrowdStrike is positioned well to benefit in a time where enterprises are increasingly looking to consolidate its cybersecurity infrastructure. As a result, CrowdStrike's platform is able to serve as a consolidated solution, which is difficult to compete with in the current cybersecurity landscape.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nGeorge Kurtz (CEO of CrowdStrike) pointed out that enterprise customers are focused on efficiency and reducing complexity, noting that Customers don't want to go backwards and have a patchwork of products. They are still focused on the consolidation piece and they're looking at us as one of the key consolidators in the market\". What was actually meant by this statement is evident in the fact that about 65% of the company's customers use five or more modules, 45% use six or more and 30% use seven or modules. Furthermore, among larger customers that spend over $100,000 annually on CrowdStrike's services, nearly half use eight or more modules. This highlights the depth of the consolidation in CrowdStrike's cybersecurity customer portfolio, making it significantly challenging to compete with.\nFurther, I found a research piece from Gartner that noted that 75% of enterprise customers are actively looking to decrease the number of cybersecurity vendors that they work with, further supporting the industry trend of vendor consolidation. Thus, the primary goal for enterprise customers is to increase integration and lower vendor management costs, and this shift will likely result in a handful of dominant players emerging in the market. Given CrowdStrike's early focus on consolidation through its Falcon platform, it is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.\nPost-Outage Recovery\nPost the outage on July 19, CrowdStrike experienced some disruption in its sales pipeline with a few deals placed on hold, and to be finalized in subsequent quarters. Consequently, management clarified to investors that the larger part of those delayed deals would still stay in the pipeline. That said, investors should be prepared to hear that some of the new customers are going to be more cautious than usual, since the company has lost some trust within the marketplace as a result of the outage. During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, CFO Burt Podbere noted the following: \"We expect to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, with additional scrutiny requiring higher levels of approval at the CEO and, in some cases, Board of Directors level.\" The meaning behind this is simple: the longer the list of approvals, the more protracted the sales cycle will be, especially in large corporations. Although the CFO didn't mention the exact delay periods, I expect bigger deals to take close to six months to finalize.\nTo address the situation, it appears that CrowdStrike has introduced customer commitment packages, wherein the company gives a discount and other incentives to their customers in return for signing longer-term contracts. This may, however, affect the company's revenues for the next few quarters, but it's important to note that CrowdStrike still managed to win several eight and nine-figure deals despite the outage. For example, within cloud security, CrowdStrike secured an eight-figure deal with a major enterprise software firm, which opted to standardize on Falcon Cloud Security across its entire business, replacing another next-gen cloud security vendor. Similarly, a nine-figure cloud security deal saw a large enterprise adopt Falcon Cloud Security across a million hosts, replacing other cloud security products.\nIn the Security information and event management (SIEM) market, CrowdStrike continues to outperform legacy SIEM providers. Two major deals stand out: an eight-figure deal with an existing customer, which replaced two legacy SIEMs with CrowdStrike's LogScale, resulting in over 60% cost savings, and a seven-figure deal with a leading generative AI company, which standardized on LogScale after a year of use, improving search speed, response times, and total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to their previous legacy SIEM solution.\nExpanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)\nCrowdStrike's growth story is further supported by the expanding TAM. In 2024, the TAM for cybersecurity is expected to be around $100 billion, but this figure is projected to grow to $225 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8%. Even if CrowdStrike only manages to grow in line with the market, the company has a long runway for growth. Given its platformization strategy, I believe CrowdStrike is positioned to outpace market growth and capture significant market share.\nStrong Results Despite Challenges\nCrowdStrike's Q2 FY25 results, in my view, basically showcase the company's resilience and strength, even in the face of significant adversity (with the recent outage and macro pressures). The company reported revenue of $964 million (up 31.7% YoY), overperforming wall-street guidance by $5.5 million. With 94% of its revenue coming from subscriptions, the growth in this segment is a key indicator of CrowdStrike's performance. Subscription revenue grew 33% YoY, while ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) was up 32%, reaching $3.9 billion. This included $218 million in net new ARR, an 11% increase YoY, in line with the company's guidance.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nCrowdStrike also reported record non-GAAP operating income of $227 million, representing a 46% YoY increase, signaling excellent operational efficiency. Notably, non-GAAP operating income is growing faster than revenue, demonstrating the company's operating leverage, a key strength in the tech sector, where many companies prioritize growth over profitability.\nRobust Cash Flow Generation\nFree cash flows increased by 44% YoY to $272 million in Q2 FY25, with a 28% free cash flow margin, highlighting the company's ability to fund its own growth. The company achieved what it calls the \"rule of 60\" during the quarter. This means that the sum of its YoY revenue growth rate (approximately 32%) and its free cash flow margin (28%) equals 60. The term is derived from the \"rule of 40,\" a concept introduced by Brad Feld, who describes it as the idea that a company's growth rate combined with its profitability should total at least 40%. For example, a 20% growth rate should correspond with a 20% profit margin, while a 50% growth rate could be paired with a 10% loss. Exceeding this benchmark is rare, which is why investors tend to value CrowdStrike more highly compared to other growth stocks.\nLowered Management Guidance\nAlthough the company reported great Q2 FY25 results despite the outage, the repercussions of the outage is largely reflected in CrowdStrike's full-year guidance. Management lowered its initial revenue guidance for FY25 by 1.5%, now expecting revenue to be between $3.896 billion and $3.989 billion, down from the original forecast of $3.924 billion to $3.989 billion. Non-GAAP operating income guidance was also reduced by 11.23%, with the new midpoint at $788.5 million, down from $888.3 million. While Q3 FY25 is expected to show continued revenue growth of 34.2%, non-GAAP operating income growth is forecasted to slow to 8.3%, reflecting the near-term impact of the outage on profitability.\nCapacity For Continued Investments\nI have already mentioned Crowdstrike's ability to drive impressive revenue growth and operational efficiency. But, in addition to this, the reason that I'm bullish on the company is mainly due to the fact that CrowdStrike's fundamental strengths are also backed by its commitment to reinvest back into the core business. Looking at the closest rival to CrowdStrike (Palo Alto Networks), CrowdStrike's Capex to CFO ratio is relatively higher. Although Palo Alto Networks has larger R&D capex spending in absolute terms, if CRWD sustains its impressive CFO growth, it will likely close the gap with PANW soon. CrowdStrike's top-line and CFO is growing much faster compared to rivals.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nStrong Balance Sheet\nCrowdStrike also maintains a solid balance sheet. As of Q2 FY25, the company held $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents against $743.2 million in long-term debt, giving it a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of 0.28. Furthermore, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.75 suggests that CrowdStrike can comfortably manage its debt using operating profits. Furthermore, while some competitors and investors overhyped the potential for CrowdStrike to lose business, the company's operating leverage remains on track. With its continued focus on platform consolidation, I expect CrowdStrike to maintain its leadership position and recover from the recent setbacks caused by the outage.\nValuation Thoughts\nFrom a valuation standpoint, I am quite optimistic about CrowdStrike's potential. I believe CrowdStrike is currently trading at a significant discount, especially when considering the several growth catalysts that will unfold in both the short and long term. At the moment, CrowdStrike is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23x, which is well below its five-year historical average of 29x. This disparity may suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its historical valuation, presenting a unique buying opportunity for investors. In the near term, I anticipate that CrowdStrike's stock may experience some additional drawdowns as investors reassess their positions in light of the recent outage. However, I view this as a temporary phase, which could provide a compelling entry point for those who may have missed out on the stock during its earlier growth stages.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nHistorically, CrowdStrike's P/S ratio has been considerably higher, so I expect that as the company fully recovers from the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) incident, its valuation will revert closer to the five-year average of 29x. Given these factors, I'm setting a target multiple of 27x, which would imply a price target of around $375 per share. This represents an upside of approximately 20%, which, in my opinion, provides a solid margin for investors to take advantage of at current levels.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[Alpha Spread]\nFrom a discounted cash flow (DCF) perspective, I used a discount rate of 8% (which reflects the company's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC) and applied a conservative terminal growth rate of 5%. This DCF analysis aligns with Wall Street's growth forecasts for CrowdStrike over the next five years, which reflects a topline-growth rate of 15% over the next five years and some operating leverage improvements as the company expands beyond endpoint protection and solidifies its position as a leader in platform consolidation, offering a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity services. The scalability and robustness of the Falcon platform have already been proven, supporting the optimistic outlook from analysts. Based on this DCF model, I derive an upside of roughly 19% (with a target price of $408), which I believe offers ample margin for value investors seeking to capitalize on CrowdStrike's current valuation. Given the company's strong fundamentals, its recovery potential, and the broader market opportunity, I see this as an attractive entry point for those looking to invest at these levels.\nConclusion\nDespite the recent outage and its immediate challenges, I remain confident in CrowdStrike's long-term growth potential. The company's current market position, and the strategy towards platform consolidation positions it well to capitalize on the growing trend of enterprise customers seeking to streamline their cybersecurity solutions with a single provider to save costs and improve efficiency. Even after the setback (with regards to BSOD), CrowdStrike secured significant deals, demonstrating resilience and maintaining market trust. Additionally, with its current valuation appearing attractive compared to historical averages, a robust balance sheet, and a proven ability to drive growth through its Falcon platform, I see this as a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on its recovery and long-term market potential.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 6.7% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nStory Continues\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs CRWD a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.65.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That's why a stock split, which multiplies the number of shares an investor owns or that an investor can buy, always makes big news. Hot tech stocks are prone to splitting when their share price gets excessively high and there is speculation these three tech stocks could be primed for a split.\nDon't Miss:\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nCrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD)\nIf you've ever surfed the web, you have likely used a website that uses CrowdStrike to keep the site secure. Since its IPO in 2019, CrowdStrike has established itself as one of the world's most recognizable cloud-based cybersecurity companies. Back then, its shares traded for only $34, but today, a share in CrowdStrike will set you back a hefty $336.\nCrowdStrike occupies a large market share, largely because it's one of the few cybersecurity companies that provide its services via cloud apps instead of directly installing applications like DVDs. This approach allows Crowdstrike's biggest clients, many of which are tech companies or have extensive Web-based operations, to keep the same service as their operations expand.\nCrowdstrike's reputation hit in the summer when it experienced a global outage that knocked some of the world's biggest tech companies offline. Despite that, the company's public filings show that CrowdStrike became profitable in 2024. More importantly, analysts expect this stock's earnings per share (EPS) to grow by over 70% by 2027. If CrowdStrike hits those targets, this stock price may shoot so high that a split becomes a strong possibility.\nTrending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% \u2014 Investors like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nMongoDB (Nasdaq: MDB)\nMongoDB manufactures database management software that allows companies more options for upscaling or customization. This flexibility lets MongoDB clients store and access their important data in the way that best suits the client instead of having to adapt to the traditional, structured method of database management offered by competing businesses.\nStory Continues\nMongoDB's IPO was in 2017 when shares in this tech company cost only $24. Today, MongoDB shares have surged to nearly $280 and its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 40% from 2018 to 2024. Although the company has yet to turn a profit, analysts at Barclays and Citigroup have recently upgraded their price targets for MongoDB to $345 and $400. If the analyst predictions are correct, MongoDB shares could be primed for a split.\nSee Also: Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.\nASML (Nasdaq: ASML)\nSemiconductors are mission-critical components in AI applications and ASML is a global leader in manufacturing lithography systems fo semiconductors superconductors. These systems work by using advanced optics to imprint circuit patterns onto microchips. This Dutch-based company counts some of the world's foremost tech companies, including Samsung and Intel as its clients.\nASML's Q3 2024 report showed a nearly 60% increase over Q3 2023 and company management predicted revenue would exceed $63 billion by 2030. This company has been around since 1995 and its stock has split four times. The last one came in 2007, but ASML's share price has jumped by nearly 1,500% to the current price of $658.63. Another bonus for ASML shareholders is that it pays a dividend of 0.098% ($6.45/share).\nConsidering this stock's previous history of splitting and its current sky-high share price, it's not hard to imagine ASML getting set for another split at some point in the future. In the meantime, analysts at JP Morgan and Wells Fargo have given ASML a \"buy now\" rating. The buy-in isn't cheap, but the prospect of earning a dividend and a future stock split makes ASML worth some attention from tech investors.\nDiversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nWhile Realty Income is undoubtedly a solid choice for investors seeking consistent monthly dividend income, it's important to remember that publicly traded stocks are subject to market volatility. For those looking to diversify their income streams and potentially reduce exposure to market fluctuations, real estate investing through platforms like Arrived is worth considering.\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio.\nThis article Investor Alert-Could These Three Hot Tech Stocks Be About To Split originally appeared on Benzinga.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 26% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE.\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CrowdStrike Holdings is:\n6.0% = US$175m \u00f7 US$2.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nCrowdStrike Holdings' Earnings Growth And 6.0% ROE\nOn the face of it, CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that CrowdStrike Holdings grew its net income at a significant rate of 28% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\nWe then compared CrowdStrike Holdings' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period.\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Past Earnings Growth November 18th 2024\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is CRWD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\nStory Continues\nIs CrowdStrike Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nGiven that CrowdStrike Holdings doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we do feel that CrowdStrike Holdings has some positive attributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for CrowdStrike Holdings, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.012 = US$53m \u00f7 (US$7.2b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).\nThus, CrowdStrike Holdings has an ROCE of 1.2%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 9.0%.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024\nIn the above chart we have measured CrowdStrike Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CrowdStrike Holdings for free.\nWhat Can We Tell From CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE Trend?\nThe fact that CrowdStrike Holdings is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 1.2% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 439% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.\nOur Take On CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE\nIn summary, it's great to see that CrowdStrike Holdings has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CrowdStrike Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\nOne more thing, we've spotted 2 warning signs facing CrowdStrike Holdings that you might find interesting.\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

Shares of Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk Software have soared 17.1% and 9.1%, respectively, while Check Point Software stock has declined 3.4% during the same time frame.\n3-Month Price Return Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis outperformance has made investors wonder if this is the right time to buy or hold CRWD stock and wait for more stability. Here\u2019s why maintaining a hold strategy could be the most prudent move.\nResilience in CRWD\u2019s Financial Performance Post Outage\nCrowdStrike\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company\u2019s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.\nThe company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm\u2019s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.\nThis robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike\u2019s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company\u2019s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation\nCrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.\nThe Falcon platform\u2019s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike\u2019s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Market Position and Customer Loyalty\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm\u2019s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.\nMoreover, the company's \u201cFalcon Flex\u201d subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.\nNavigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike\nDespite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company\u2019s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management\u2019s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.\nAnalysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPotential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike\u2019s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern\nCrowdStrike\u2019s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry\u2019s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now\nWhile CrowdStrike\u2019s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.29%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.86%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.09%.\nThe cloud-based security company's stock has climbed by 10.27% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.3%.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of CrowdStrike Holdings in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on November 26, 2024. On that day, CrowdStrike Holdings is projected to report earnings of $0.82 per share, which would represent no growth from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $982.26 million, indicating a 24.97% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion. These totals would mark changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.13% lower. Currently, CrowdStrike Holdings is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note CrowdStrike Holdings's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 93.93. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 32.89.\nWe can additionally observe that CRWD currently boasts a PEG ratio of 3.33. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.52.\nStory Continues\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 52, putting it in the top 21% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nEarlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike\u2019s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn\u2019t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon\u2019s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.\nClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 6th on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.\nIs Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?\nOn November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.\nNow that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined\u00a0Catalysts\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.\nMcLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.\nMcLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to \u201cswitch course.\u201d\nOn the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined\u00a0Wealth!\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.\nDatta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.\nHe suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to \u201cpivot away\u201d from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.\nStory Continues\nAs the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) the Best Stock to Buy and Hold for 5 Years?\nAn engineer typing on a computer, developing the latest cybersecurity application.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that ranks 10th on our list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. The company provides a range of security products including identity management, threat intelligence, and threat detection.\nThe company has 29,000 clients in multiple sectors, including healthcare, retail, technology, and the government. Its AI-native cybersecurity platform, Falcon, is its primary product that grew at 80% year-over-year in FQ2 2025. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has recently closed crucial partnerships, added innovations to its Falcon Platform, and expanded its CrowdStrike Marketplace to meet the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions.\nThe July 19 incident has left a bearing on the company. Despite that, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been resilient and showcased transparency and accountability to its customers. On August 29, Joseph Gallo from Jefferies appeared in an interview on Schwab Network to share his thesis on CRWD. He shares that CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has saved a lot of people in the security business and has the resources to continue doing so. Gallo emphasizes that despite the incident the product stands as a \u201csticky product\u201d and has taken an appropriate \u201cprudent\u201d cut to their revenue to ease their customers and investors alike.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is working on revolutionizing cybersecurity using artificial intelligence, positioning CRWD ahead of its competitors in the long run. Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their high price target of $540 represents an upside of 69% from current levels, as of November 7.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 10th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers\u2014critical components for Nvidia\u2019s AI-focused operations.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nA strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.\nHistorically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s during major market reactions. Nvidia\u2019s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.\nHow To Buy AVGO Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\nStory Continues\nCheck It Out:\nArrived Achieved A Total Return of 34.7% On Their Biggest Sale Yet \u2014 Diversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio.\nIn October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors. Arrived aims to continue delivering similar value across our portfolio through careful market selection, attentive property management, and thoughtful timing in sales.\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nChip stocks are down 3% since the election. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure.\nOnce the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months.\nNvidia (NVDA) earnings \u2014 coming after the bell Wednesday \u2014 will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday.\n\"It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,\" said Essaye. \"It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.\"\nNvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock \u2014 up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years \u2014 hit record highs following the election.\nBut many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.\nSemiconductor returns during the second half of 2024\nThe worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.\nMeanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) \u2014 seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor \u2014 is down 14%.\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTo be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday.\n\"Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],\" said Essaye.\nSince the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia \u2014 \"priced to perfection\" according to many analysts \u2014 underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.\nStory Continues\nBut Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this \"bellwether\" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.\n\"They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far,\" he said. \"I think they can do it again.\"\nmorning brief image\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.\nWhen it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there\u2019s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University\u2019s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).\nFounded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university\u2019s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard\u2019s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard\u2019s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university\u2019s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard\u2019s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.\nAccording to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. \u201cNarv\u201d Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia\u2019s 11.5% or Brown\u2019s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC\u2019s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:\n\u201cIn FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC\u2019s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.\u201d\nNotably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from \"overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500.\" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar\u2019s strategy of overhauling the university\u2019s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Harvard Management Company\u2019s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nHarvard Management Company's Stake: $89.6 million\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the world\u2019s largest technology companies, with operations spanning the hardware and software sectors. The company\u2019s primary strength is in hardware, as it supplies networking and custom chips across diverse applications.\nIn its third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and robust non-AI semiconductor sales. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI revenue to grow 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the annual AI revenue to $12 billion, largely fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOn November 6, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company\u2019s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing \u201cseasonal headwinds\u201d linked to a product transition for Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's \"easy\" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some \"serious gains.\"\n\"I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It\u2019s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don\u2019t count. But that, people, is nonsense.\"\nCramer said banks do not \"care\" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.\n\"I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I\u2019m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.\"\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks.\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's talking about.

I think Broadcom should do well. I don\u2019t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.\u201d\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market.\u00a0Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe continued to build our position in\u00a0Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "Broadcom: 3 Reasons We Love This Stock\nBroadcom currently trades at $165.14 and has been a dream stock for shareholders. It\u2019s returned 431% since November 2019, blowing past the S&P 500\u2019s 87.9% gain. The company has also beaten the index over the past six months as its stock price is up 16.8%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy AVGO? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is AVGO a Good Business?\nOriginally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.\n1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Over the last five years, Broadcom grew its sales at an excellent 16% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).\nBroadcom Quarterly Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nBroadcom\u2019s management team is currently guiding for a 50.6% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect Broadcom\u2019s revenue to grow 24.6% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus its 21.6% annualized growth rate for the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and implies its newer products and services will catalyze higher growth rates.\n3. Excellent Free Cash Flow Boosts Reinvestment Potential\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nBroadcom has shown terrific cash profitability, and if sustainable, puts it in an advantageous position to invest in new products, return capital to investors, and consolidate the market during industry downturns. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the semiconductor sector, averaging an eye-popping 43.8% over the last two years.\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we think Broadcom is a great business, and with its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 28.2x forward price-to-earnings (or $165.14 per share). Is now a good time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than Broadcom\nThe elections are now behind us. With rates dropping and inflation cooling, many analysts expect a breakout market to cap off the year - and we\u2019re zeroing in on the stocks that could benefit immensely.\nTake advantage of the rebound by checking out our Top 9 Market-Beating Stocks. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like Comfort Systems (+783% five-year return).

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 points to a change of +14% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nData is at the forefront of many inventions today and is the primary ingredient of innovation. Of the many branches of data usage, predictive analytics is garnering immense traction, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistics, modeling, and machine learning to forecast, predict, and plan future events. There are different types of predictive analytics including regression analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics market was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023. The global predictive analytics market is expected to grow to $95.3 billion by 2032 from $18.02 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%. The report attributes the growth in the industry to the growing investments in data by the government and large corporations followed by IoT and AI integrations. The use of predictive analytics is bifurcated into multiple segments including life sciences, automotive, retail, energy, telecom, and healthcare, to name a few.\nStartups Disrupting the Predictive Analytics Space\nThere are a range of startups in the predictive analytics space that are revolutionizing the industry. One such name is Pecan AI. The automated predictive analytics platform is developed and designed intricately to meet the needs of data scientists. Data scientists can use the platform to build powerful predictive AI capabilities and machine learning models that drive business impact. Data scientists do not need coding or data science skills to make use of the platform. The platform is used by a range of companies including Johnson & Johnson, SciPlay, Hydrant, Kenvue, Proper Cloth, and DME Acquire. Earlier in January, the company introduced predictive generative AI to transform enterprises. Pecan AI also has partnerships with some of the largest tech corporations and platforms including Azure and AWS.\nDataRobot is another leader in the predictive analytics industry that delivers revolutionary AI use cases for businesses. Its AI platform consists of core AI features such as generative AI, predictive AI, AI governance, AI observability, and AI foundation. The platform promises 83% faster deployment and secures nearly 1.4 billion predictions every day. Users can run models in minutes by skipping manual data preparation and cleaning. Additionally, the platform eliminates the need for repetitive coding, by streamlining feature discovery and defining elements of datasets automatically. Users can connect data from warehouses such as AWS and Azure into a singular workspace. Some of the predictive use cases facilitated by DataRobot include time series modeling, clustering and seasonality, cold start forecasting, nowcasting, and anomaly detection.\nStory Continues\nNow that we have studied the predictive analytics industry and some revolutionary startups, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now we went through multiple reports on the internet, ETFs, and stock screeners. We then examined the analyst upside of each stock and ranked the ones with the highest percentage. Our list is in ascending order of the analyst upside as of November 11, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Predictive Analytics Stock to Invest in Now?\nA data analyst working at a computer, crunching numbers for the company's 80% total assets.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nAnalyst upside as of November 11, 2024: 12%\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) offers predictive analytics through its Automation Analytics and Intelligence platform. The platform offers workload automation solutions supported by a predictive analytics workload platform allowing entities to visualize data and manage complex workloads that facilitate the development of crucial business insights.\nSome key features of the platform by Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) include cross-platform visibility, dynamic service level management, enhanced workload analytics, business monitoring, enhanced change control, and dynamic critical path discovery. All these features combined put AVGO ahead of its competitors.\nOverall, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a rapidly growing company with expertise in ASICs, infrastructure software, and data analytics, contributing to its ranking on our list. Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their median price target of $200 implies an upside of 12%, as of November 11.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cWe continued to build our position in\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 8th on our list of best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain.\nWhile the stock has fallen 10% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.5% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 39% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 140.31.\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Earnings Per Share Growth November 16th 2024\nDive deeper into Broadcom's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Broadcom's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWhat About Dividends?\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Broadcom's TSR for the last 5 years was 507%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nA Different Perspective\nWe're pleased to report that Broadcom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 71% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 43%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

          "whole_article": "The post-election rally of Wall Street after Donald Trump became President for the second term, has evaporated. As the initial euphoria of market participants is over, investors are assessing the pros and cons of Trump\u2019s economic policies, such as the imposition of tariffs, reduction of corporate taxes, deregulation of corporate America and their impact on inflation.\nThe technology sector is also concerned about Trump\u2019s tariffs on high-end chipsets, the future of the $52.5 billion Chips and Science Act and the imposition of antitrust regulations on big techs. Nevertheless, I believe that the AI frenzy will continue as this technology has become the need of the hour.\nAt this stage, we recommend five generative artificial intelligence (AI) behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank that have double-digit upside potential in the short term. These are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nAI Frenzy Remains Intact\nThe astonishing rally of U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative AI technology across the world was the prime factor.\nBloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending will increase from $67 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. UBS estimated that four U.S. technology giants that are member of the so-called \u201cmagnificent 7\u201d will spend around $267 billion as capital expenditure on AI applications in 2025, a jump of 33.5% year over year.\n5 AI Bigwigs to Buy With Double-Digit Short-Term Appreciation\nEach of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI (Gen AI) solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products. GOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance search results continue to boost traffic on GOOGL\u2019s search engine.\nStory Continues\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 17.6% from the last closing price of $175.58. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $185-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 36.7% and no downside.\nMeta Platforms Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Meta Platforms is set to receive initial shipments of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s (NVDA) new flagship AI chip later this year. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META is set to get B200 Blackwell chips.\nMETA\u2019s AI-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms. Management said that the company will invest $38-$40 billion as capital expenditure in AI initiatives in 2024. Moreover, capital spending is likely to reach more than $50 billion in 2025.\nOn July 24, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA\u2019s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbents like Open AI.\nStrong Price Upside Potential for META Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $577.16. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $475-$811. This indicates a maximum upside of 40.5% and a maximum downside of 17.7%.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\nZacks Rank #1 Taiwan Semiconductor is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world\u2019s best AI chipset developers. It has a strong clientele. The company is the largest manufacturer of NVIDIA\u2019s chipsets. NVIDIA is globally the largest developer of generative AI-based chips.\nTSM provides a range of wafer fabrication processes, including processes to manufacture complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, embedded memory, bipolar CMOS mixed-signal, and others.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is experiencing solid demand for its advanced technologies, such as 3-nanometer (nm) and 5nm. The growing adoption of its multi-project wafer processing service, which allows customers to reduce mask costs, is driving its customer momentum.\nTSM\u2019s growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus. Also, strength across its 7nm, 16nm and 28nm technologies are contributing well to its top-line growth.\nExcellent Price Upside Potential for TSM Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19.2% from the last closing price of $188.50. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $200-$250. This indicates a maximum upside of 32.6% and no downside.\nAdobe Inc.\nZacks Rank #2 Adobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster.\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\nAttractive Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.4% from the last closing price of $529.87. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703. This indicates a maximum upside of 32.7% and a maximum downside of 17%.\nBroadcom Inc.\nBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. In second-quarter 2024, it witnessed strong demand for custom AI accelerators, AI networking solutions, Ethernet switching, optical lasers, thin dies, PCI Express switches and Network Interface Cards from hyperscale customers. AVGO\u2019s solutions are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers.\nThe acquisition of VMware has benefited the infrastructure software solutions of Broadcom. VMware\u2019s expanding clientele, which includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms, is noteworthy. AVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AI revenues are now expected to be $12 billion for fiscal 2024.\nSolid Price Upside Potential for AVGO Stock\nThe average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 12.5% from the last closing price of $170.38. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $150-$240.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:\n14% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\nTo start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.\nNYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\nStory Continues\nIs ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nCramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:\n\u201cLet's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive\u2026 Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market\u2026 Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting\u2026 Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again\u2026 Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company\u2019s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.\nOverall NOW ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing \u201csovereign\u201d artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to \u201ccodify\u201d a country\u2019s culture, history, and collective intelligence.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News You Must Read Today.\nThat said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.\u201d\nWhile AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.\nLatest Advancements in AI\nIn recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification\u201d.\nStory Continues\nOther fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.\nIn other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed \u201cOperator\u201d, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human\u2019s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia\u2019s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.\nThis partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.\nFor the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013November 15, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Toast TOST, as the Bull of the Day and Clean Harbors CLH, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nToast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.\nThe stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock\u2019s ongoing upward momentum.\nAbout the Company\nToast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.\nWith its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.\nIts platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.\nToast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of \u201cA\u201d in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a \u201cF\u201d in Value.\nQ3 Earnings Beat\nOn November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.\nQ3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.\nThe company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.\nGross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.\nManagement comments were overwhelmingly bullish:\n\u201cToast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.\u201d\nEstimates Headed Higher\nAnalysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.\nStory Continues\nFor the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.\nFor the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.\nFor the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.\nToast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote\nWith the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.\nJPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.\nThe Technical Take\nThe stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO\u2019d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.\nAfter trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.\nWith the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.\nPost earnings low: $36\nGap fill: $33\n21-day: $32\n50-day: $29.20\n200-day: $25.20\nFibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32\nWhile that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.\nIn Summary\nToast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.\nThe company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.\nAs Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.\nBear of the Day:\nClean Harbors \u00a0is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.\nThe company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?\nWith an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.\nAbout the Company\nClean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).\nThe company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world\u2019s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.\nCLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cD\u201d in Value, But \u201cB\u201d in both Momentum and Growth.\nQ3 Earnings\nThe company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.\nDespite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.\nPositive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.\nWhile there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.\nEarnings Estimates\nEstimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.\nFor the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.\nLooking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.\nFor the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year\u2019s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.\nTechnical Take\nThe drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.\nThis volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.\nThe drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.\nThe stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.\nIn Summary\nClean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.\nWith significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.\nAdditional content:\nServiceNow Expands Generative AI Offerings: Is the Stock a Buy?\nServiceNow\u00a0is adding Generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to the Now platform to foster responsible AI. NOW is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio, including new, expanded Now Assist capabilities with an AI Governance feature for secure and compliant AI practices.\nNOW\u2019s expanding GenAI portfolio and rich partner base have been driving top-line growth. A strong partner base, which includes the likes of Microsoft , NVIDIA and many more, is strengthening ServiceNow\u2019s AI capabilities.\nNOW and Five9 recently signed an expanded partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified end-to-end employee and customer experiences by combining ServiceNow Customer Service Management and the Five9 platform.\nNOW\u2019s prospects remain bright, with shares appreciating 48% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers \u2013 IT Services industry\u2019s returns of 30% and 15.8%, respectively.\nServiceNow shares are trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\nLet us dig deeper to find out the factors driving NOW\u2019s prospects.\nServiceNow Raises Subscription Revenue Guidance\nFor 2024, NOW expects subscription revenues of $10.655-$10.66 billion (up from previous guidance of $10.575-$10.585 billion), which suggests a rise of 23% from the 2023 actuals on a GAAP basis and 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects the non-GAAP subscription gross margin to be 84.5% and the non-GAAP operating margin to be 29.5%. The free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, subscription revenues are projected between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 21.5-22% on a GAAP basis. At cc, subscription revenues are expected to grow at 20.5%.\nCurrent Remaining Performance Obligation is expected to grow 21.5% year over year on both non-GAAP and GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% for the current quarter.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $13.87 per share, up 0.4% over the past 30 days, indicating a 28.66% year-over-year increase.\nServiceNow, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ServiceNow, Inc. Quote\nThe consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.\nStrong Portfolio Aids NOW\u2019s Prospects\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.\nServiceNow\u2019s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.\nThe Xanadu update adds the latest AI capabilities to boost customer agility, enhance productivity and improve employee experiences. It expands the GenAI portfolio to enterprise functions, including Security, and Sourcing & Procurement Operations.\nNOW plans to integrate Agentic AI into the ServiceNow platform and unlock 24/7 productivity at a massive scale. This service will be available this November for Customer Service Management AI Agents and IT Service Management AI Agents. It is expected to reduce the time to resolve an issue and make live agents more productive.\nStrong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive\nA strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nNOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.\nThe strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.\nIn third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.\nNOW\u2019s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation\nHowever, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector\u2019s 6.37X.\nWe believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow\u2019s premium valuation.\nConclusion\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.\nServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) Elevates Now Platform with Enhanced AI Governance and GenAI Solutions\nA technician connecting an EV battery to the Grid Integrated Vehicle platform.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nMarket Capitalization: $215.95 billion\nServiceNow, Inc.

ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.\n\nThe strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.\n\nIn third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.\nNOW\u2019s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation\nHowever, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector\u2019s 6.37X.\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M)\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWe believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow\u2019s premium valuation.\nConclusion\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues.

          "whole_article": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in NOW?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.\nInsiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nNYSE:NOW Insider Trading Volume November 14th 2024\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of ServiceNow\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?\nInsiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps digitize and unify organizations so that they can find smarter, faster, better ways to make work flow.\nOn November 12, Wells Fargo raised the firm\u2019s price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $1,150 from $1,050 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares. According to the firm, ServiceNow is among the few companies that are demonstrating tangible AI monetization, i.e. they are really making money from AI. One of the key catalysts that will drive this momentum forward is the launch of its CSM/ITSM agents in Xanadu on November 24. The launch is a major step for the company in enhancing its AI-led customer service offerings. Finally, Wells Fargo expects ServiceNow to take the lead in AI customer service.\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?\u201d\nCramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.\n\u201cTrump wants to cut taxes\u2014all taxes\u2014including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It\u2019s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that\u2019s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.\u201d\nCramer said the market is still \u201coversold\u201d as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow Customer Service Management and Five9 Intelligent CX Platform to streamline self-service and assisted service operations\nIntegrated solution to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction\nTORONTO & BARCELONA, Spain, November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow World Forum & Five9 CX Summit\u2014ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, and Five9 (NASDAQ: FIVN), provider of the Intelligent CX Platform, today announced an expanded partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified end-to-end employee and customer experiences. By combining the strengths of ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) and the Five9 platform, the solution will create more streamlined self-service and assisted service operations and unify customer support processes to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and simplify contact center operations.\n\"Organizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together,\" said John Ball, senior vice president, Customer and Industry Workflows at ServiceNow. \"ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self-service and assisted service across voice and digital channels. Our expanded partnership with Five9 takes this even further, combining the best of both platforms to streamline and unify contact center operations with a turnkey solution that\u2019s fast to deploy and delivers fast ROI.\"\n\"Five9\u2019s longstanding partnership with ServiceNow has been rooted in the joint mission to create seamless and powerful end-to-end customer experiences,\" said Callan Schebella, executive vice president, product management, Five9. \"This next phase of our partnership transforms the approach to customer experience management, alleviating a lot of the frustrations that come with using multiple systems to address customer needs. We\u2019ve taken a big step forward to empower customers with our joint AI capabilities and improved interface functionality, easing the day-to-day challenges of customer-facing service.\"\n\"Combining the most valuable features into a unified interface can transform the way we support our customers,\" said Bob Massengill, senior director, Technology Infrastructure, Pilot Travel Centers, LLC. \"This new ServiceNow-Five9 joint solution has the potential to enable us to address customer needs more quickly and effectively.\"\nStory Continues\nThe new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.\nReal-time Transcription \u2013 Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents\u2019 work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.\nUnified Routing \u2013 Five9\u2019s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9. This reduces operational overhead for managers through streamlined routing management across both systems, making it easier to adjust staffing during high-demand periods. It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.\nSingle Agent Experience \u2013 Native Call Controls within ServiceNow\u2019s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer\u2019s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.\nAvailability\nThe ServiceNow and Five9 integrated capabilities are expected to be available to select customers in the first half of 2025.\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people. We move with the pace of innovation to help customers transform organizations across every industry while upholding a trustworthy, human centered approach to deploying our products and services at scale.

          "whole_article": "(Photo: Business Wire)\nNew Now Assist capabilities drive greater visibility and controls with AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices\nNative multilingual support extends global footprint for seamless, culturally aware GenAI communications and translations\nPurpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, today announced new generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to advance autonomous, responsible AI on the Now Platform. With this launch, ServiceNow is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio for customers. This includes new, expanded Now Assist capabilities that drive greater visibility and controls with an AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices. Native multilingual support in Now Assist extends GenAI\u2019s global footprint for seamless, culturally aware communications and translations. Finally, purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety.\nAs enterprises have accelerated the adoption of GenAI, they are discovering that siloed applications and scattered data are barriers to impact and that establishing clearly defined, human-centric governance processes are essential to the effective use and oversight of GenAI. That\u2019s why ServiceNow delivers a winning combination of one platform with an integrated data layer and continues to optimize its AI platform for speed, scale, and security. The single architecture of the Now Platform helps ensure strong governance is embedded in its Now Assist GenAI solutions, models, and agents no matter where they are deployed in an organization.\n\"Enterprises across every industry are embracing a future of greater autonomy and productivity, all in service to their employees, customers, and overall business impact,\" said Jon Sigler, senior vice president of Platform and AI at ServiceNow. \"The ServiceNow platform was built to empower this transformation, offering smarter, faster ways of working through AI-enabled automation. With governance at the core, these new innovations bring more personalized, collaborative, trusted experiences to life across the enterprise.\"\nElevating customer trust with integrated AI governance\nTeams working with AI are often burdened with siloed tools and systems, making visibility and AI governance difficult. AI governance requires the integration of complex business processes and needs a best-of-breed workflow platform to be implemented successfully. With a unified AI inventory data model for connecting AI strategy, technology, security, and compliance to operate as an AI control tower, and expanded oversight for AI Governance for Now Assist, ServiceNow is laying a foundation to help customers build trust while accelerating business transformation.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow also introduced new Now Assist capabilities that empower customers with the tools needed for responsible AI use:\nNow Assist Guardian provides built-in monitoring and responsible AI guardrails so customers can better control the use of GenAI on the Now Platform. This includes the management and mitigation of offensive content, security vulnerabilities, and the exposure of sensitive information.\nNow Assist Data Kit eases the often-cumbersome task of managing and consuming data for AI use cases. Users can create and easily manage datasets for AI skills and applications, develop ground truth datasets to benchmark for accuracy and help predict AI outcomes, and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of experiences built with Now Assist Skill Kit.\nNow Assist Analytics offers greater visibility into the adoption, usage, and performance of Now Assist across the enterprise. With these insights, customers can make more informed, data-driven decisions to advance GenAI adoption, evaluate ROI on GenAI investments, and enable better business outcomes.\nExtending the value and impact of GenAI globally\nWith today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow is adding new built-in multilingual features to Now Assist. These new features address customer demand and expand the application of ServiceNow\u2019s GenAI solutions in global markets. Now Assist can now generate, summarize, and respond to GenAI prompts in the user\u2019s native language, providing improved, culturally aware understanding and communication for both agents and requestors.\nThe following languages are supported natively by Now Assist: English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese. Other languages will continue to be supported with ServiceNow\u2019s existing Dynamic Translation, which automatically translates user inputs and a response back in the user\u2019s language.\nAccelerating productivity with tailored Now Assist solutions\nBuilding on the Xanadu platform release\u2014which marked the company\u2019s most comprehensive set of AI innovations to date\u2014ServiceNow has further expanded Now Assist solutions, purpose-built for specific enterprise use cases. From configuration management to legal affairs and health and safety, GenAI can help transform the productivity and efficacy of these critical internal functions.\nNow Assist for Configuration Management Database (CMDB) uses AI to make managing and understanding data easier for customers. It helps users keep a clean and accurate CMDB by reducing duplicate data, simplifying complex information, and streamlining data input. With Now Assist for CMDB, users can quickly view summaries of Configuration Items (CIs) and their dependencies, and AI can find and fix duplicate data automatically. It also assists in the setup of Service Graph Connectors to bring data into the CMDB and fix any issues that come up during the process.\nNow Assist for Legal Service Delivery helps legal teams deliver faster service to clients with auto-generated summaries of legal requests and matters. Legal teams are often juggling multiple requests and complex legal matters, such as investigations, simultaneously. With Now Assist, they can fulfill these requests with greater efficiency and faster time to resolution.\nNow Assist in Contract Management streamlines contract processing and reduces risk by leveraging GenAI to automatically flag non-standard language, identify missing clauses and suggest revisions within contracts such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Additionally, GenAI provides rapid insights into contractual terms and obligations by intelligently extracting metadata from contracts. This helps reduce cost, revenue leakage, and risk for the enterprise.\nNow Assist for Health and Safety helps ensure a safer environment for employees by streamlining incident management processes while reducing manual, repetitive work for health and safety workers. It uses GenAI to auto-generate summaries of safety incidents and lessons learned based on incident records, resulting in more effective communication, improved agent productivity, and proactive prevention and resolution of incidents.\nIn addition to these new innovations, ServiceNow Impact\u2014the ServiceNow customer success solution to maximize AI, optimize performance, provide on-demand expertise, and accelerate business value\u2014includes new GenAI accelerators to help make adoption of Now Assist solutions easier and faster for customers.\n\"Worldwide spending on AI is projected to grow 3 times greater than the five-year CAGR for worldwide IT spending over the same period (2023-2028), driven by the rapid infusion of AI and GenAI for employee experience, customer engagement, business processes, and industry innovation,\" said Ritu Jyoti, general manager/group VP, AI, and Data market research and advisory at IDC. \"As organizations look to drive value from AI transformations, they recognize the need for a single and scalable platform that connects people, processes, data, and systems. ServiceNow is meeting customers where they are by streamlining workflows and simplifying complex processes on a single AI-powered platform. As ServiceNow expands GenAI into new areas of the enterprise, the company continues to help organizations transform operations and stay competitive.\"\nCustomers like EY are already seeing the benefits of Now Assist.\n\"GenAI is having a huge impact on our organization, both in the way EY teams deliver EY services and support EY people, but also in creating opportunities to go to market with ServiceNow to help EY clients transform their businesses,\" said Hank Prybylski, Global Vice Chair, Transformation, EY. \"We are seeing incredible value in the Now Assist space and looking to extend that to a whole suite of areas including customer service management and more broadly to our managed services environment.\"\nPutting data and AI to work across the Now Platform\nOn top of today\u2019s launch, ServiceNow recently announced Workflow Data Fabric, a breakthrough innovation that enhances all ServiceNow workflows, AI solutions, and AI Agents.\nThis enhanced, integrated data layer allows customers to connect, understand, and act on structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data across the enterprise, inside and outside of ServiceNow. Coupled with zero copy capabilities and the future integration of Knowledge Graph, which transforms raw data into contextual insights, ServiceNow is unifying people, processes, operations, and systems so AI can work more autonomously across the enterprise.\nThese data capabilities are an instrumental part of ServiceNow's vision of AI Agents that work autonomously and collaboratively with people to enable business transformation. This vision also includes the expansion of its partnership with NVIDIA to jointly develop AI agent use cases on the Now Platform and accelerate the adoption of Agentic AI, reinventing how AI delivers value across all industries.\nAvailability\nAI Governance for Now Assist is available today to a limited set of customers and is expected to be generally available in Q1 2025. All other new GenAI innovations announced today are now generally available to customers in the ServiceNow Store.\nAdditional Information\nLearn more about ServiceNow Now Assist here.\nRead about additional news from ServiceNow today:\nNew innovations enhance developer productivity, industry momentum\nServiceNow and Five9 expand partnership to deliver unified, end-to-end agent and customer experiences\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.
