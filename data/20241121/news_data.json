(NASDAQ:META) stands against other AI stocks to watch according to latest news and ratings.\nArtificial intelligence businesses have taken Wall Street by storm in the past few months. One of the most notable success stories has been OpenAI, the AI startup that has become the most valuable private firm in the world with a valuation of over $157 billion. However, the company is facing multiple lawsuits regarding the use of data from news publications without attribution. After US-based The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune took the company to court, Indian news publication ANI has also alleged that the ChatGPT creator is using published content without permission to help train the AI chatbot to provide information to users.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nEven as it faces these lawsuits, the company is blazing forward with plans to expand the use of the AI chatbot. Kevin Weil, the chief product officer of the company, recently announced on social media platform X that the firm is expanding the Advanced Voice Mode feature of ChatGPT to the web. This will let users talk to the AI chatbot right from their browser. However, the latest feature will only be available to Plus, Enterprise, Teams, or Edu subscribers, the paid members of ChatGPT. This feature is already available on the standalone applications of the product on popular mobile software platforms like Android and iOS.\nREAD ALSO: 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Nvidia (NVDA) is assuaging Wall Street\u2019s concerns about any potential slowdowns in the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip, telling investors during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that it\u2019s on pace to exceed its previous revenue estimates for the current quarter.\n\u201cBlackwell production is in full steam,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. \u201cI think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.\u201d\nPrior to the earnings call, The Information reported on Nov. 17 that Nvidia was contending with overheating issues related to its Blackwell-based servers leading suppliers to adjust the design of the racks that house the servers. Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected.\nThe report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time.\nNow Nvidia is saying that the chips aren\u2019t just shipping, they\u2019re in the hands of all of the company\u2019s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker\u2019s data center revenue. Ensuring they\u2019re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia\u2019s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nRead more: Nvidia nearly triples in value over 11 months: Is it time to invest?\n\u201cWith any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,\u201d Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u201cAnd I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth\u2019s chips makes it difficult to meet demand.\n\u201cIt is the case that demand exceeds supply,\u201d Huang told analysts. \u201cAnd that\u2019s expected as we\u2019re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.\u201d\nCEO Jensen Huang speaks during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nFor some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.\nThe H100 is Nvidia\u2019s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.\nStory Continues\nAs Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need.\n\u201cNvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,\u201d New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. \u201cAnd so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.\u201d\nIn its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company\u2019s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

However, as the AI boom plays out, the central bank in Europe has issued a dire warning about the development of an AI bubble. The warning was included in the biannual Financial Stability Review, a report that lists the risks that could threaten the financial well being of world markets. In the review, the European Central Bank noted that the stock market, particularly in the United States, had become increasingly dependent on a handful of companies perceived as the beneficiaries of the AI boom.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPer the ECB, this concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble. It added that in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointing. The ECB further underlined that investors were demanding a low premium to own shares and bonds while funds had cut their cash buffers. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments, the ECB said.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Meta Platforms (META) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this social media company a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 51.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 32.2%.\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.57, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too.

The latest manifestation of this is the latest advertisement by Coca-Cola, one of the most popular drink brands in the world, which was made entirely using AI features. However, these advertisements have not been well-received on social media. Per a report by news platform Forbes, the AI-generated Christmas ads have sparked mockery and caution from social media users. The ads were created by Secret Level, Silverside AI and Wild Card, who used AI models Leonardo, Luma, Runway, and Kling, for creative inspiration.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nMeanwhile, finance news publication Financial Times reports that China\u2019s biggest tech groups are building artificial intelligence teams in Silicon Valley. Per the report, the Chinese are hoping to poach staff from US rivals who could help them make up ground in the race to profit from generative AI. FT claims that Alibaba, ByteDance and Meituan are three Chinese firms that have been expanding their offices in California in recent months.

          "whole_article": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Meta Platforms (META) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 52 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 52 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 82.7% and 3.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for META\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for META\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Meta Platforms, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs META Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.1% over the past month to $22.53.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "By Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - Numenta, a company with backing from the Gates Foundation, on Wednesday released an open-source AI model it hopes will require less energy and data to create intelligent machines than existing technologies.\nNumenta was co-founded by Jeff Hawkins, the founder of Palm Computing in the 1990s, which in turn invented the Palm Pilot. Hawkins' deepest academic interest is neuroscience, which showed up in the Palm Pilot's handwriting recognition software that leveraged an earlier era of artificial intelligence.\nWhile most of today's popular AI systems are roughly modeled on human brains with a technology called neural networks, Numenta has a different idea of how the brain works and hopes to persuade AI researchers to try its approach.\nMost current AI systems ingest huge amounts of static data - such as massive libraries of text or images - and run that through thousands or even tens of thousands of computing chips. After weeks or months of computing using vast amounts of electricity, the AI system is trained to generate responses to human queries.\nNumenta believes that such training can be a more constant process, where brain cells gather small bits of information from senses such as sight and touch and constantly develop models of the world that can be modified on the fly as conditions change, like a young child learning a new toy.\nThe company says the approach can be applied to robots that learn to navigate the world and other types of knowledge like writing. On Wednesday, it will release open source computer code to let other companies and researchers try its approach.\nOther firms such as Meta Platforms have also made their AI technology freely available. That has helped Meta catch up to rivals such as OpenAI, but has also led to the use of Meta's technology by the Chinese military.\nSubutai Ahmad, Numenta's chief executive, said the company will closely monitor how its technology is used once it becomes public.\n\"The technology is still early, and the way we deal with this will depend on the exact way the technology matures,\" Ahmad told Reuters. \"These are important issues that we need to think about.\"\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler)\nView Comments"

The Chinese president also called for more international governance and cooperation on AI.

The system also can handle more sophisticated requests in a quicker fashion, they said.\nRevamping the 13-year-old Siri service is part of Apple\u2019s efforts to become a force in artificial intelligence. The company debuted its much-ballyhooed Apple Intelligence platform last month, but it still lacks many of the features offered by other tech giants.\nThe new voice assistant, which will eventually be added to Apple Intelligence, is dubbed \u201cLLM Siri\u201d by those working on it. LLMs \u2014 a building block of generative AI \u2014 gorge on massive amounts of data in order to identify patterns and answer questions.\nApple has been testing the upgraded software on iPhones, iPads and Macs as a separate app, but the technology will ultimately replace the Siri interface that users rely on today. The company is planning to announce the overhaul as soon as 2025 as part of the upcoming iOS 19 and macOS 16 software updates, which are internally named Luck and Cheer, the people said.\nLike Apple Intelligence this fall, the new features won\u2019t immediately be included in next year\u2019s crop of hardware devices. Instead, Apple is currently planning to release the new Siri to consumers as early as spring 2026, about a year and a half from now. Given that Apple is still several months away from announcing the plan, the timing and features could still shift.\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\nThe revamped Siri will rely on new Apple AI models to interact more like a human and handle tasks in a way that\u2019s closer to ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini. It also will make expanded use of App Intents, which allow for more precise control of third-party apps. And the software will be able to tap into features from Apple Intelligence, such as the ability to write and summarize text.\nStory Continues\nThough Apple heralded \u201cthe start of a new era\u201d for Siri when it first unveiled its AI platform in June, the company has yet to truly overhaul the software. The upgrades that accompanied Apple Intelligence were mostly cosmetic, including a new glowing interface that shows users when they\u2019ve triggered the assistant. There\u2019s also an option to type commands \u2014 rather than speaking them \u2014 and the ability to better understand users.\nSiri will get additional tweaks in the coming months as part of iOS 18, the iPhone\u2019s current operating system. The software will be able to draw on customer data to provide context for commands and take action using the information on a user\u2019s screen. The iOS 18 version relies on a first-generation Apple LLM to determine if requests should use the existing Siri infrastructure or be routed to a second LLM that can handle more complex queries and tap into third-party apps.\nThe next-generation LLM planned for iOS 19 will be a new, end-to-end system that provides more advanced, ChatGPT-like capabilities.\nWhile the company works on that new technology, it will add ChatGPT to Apple Intelligence next month. Later, Apple plans to offer additional chatbot options, such as Gemini. The idea behind the new Siri is to bring these kinds of capabilities in-house, while emphasizing user privacy. But the company could still continue to offer access to third-party AI systems that provide specialized abilities or information.\nIn recent weeks, Apple has posted job listings that hint at its plan for a more conversational Siri.\n\u201cYou will join a team that is redefining computing, creating groundbreaking conversational assistant technologies for both large-scale systems and new client devices, and with the people who built the intelligent assistants,\u201d one listing reads. Others ask for candidates with knowledge in conversational AI interfaces and underlying technologies.\nApple has been looking to give Siri more conversational abilities for several years but struggled to find the right technology. Over a year ago, Apple moved the team responsible for the way Siri interacts with users from the company\u2019s AI division to its group responsible for software interfaces. The team is now led by Alan Dye, the company\u2019s vice president of human interface design.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nJaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers\nClear\u2019s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End\nAn Airline\u2019s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare\nWhy \u2018Premiumization\u2019 Has Made Flying So Much Better\u2014and Worse\nTrump and the Triumph of America\u2019s New Elite\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Apple saw a sharp decrease in iPhone sales across China during this year's Singles' Day, the world's biggest shopping festival, amid stiff competition from mainland smartphone rivals and weak domestic consumption, according to a new report.\nThe country's two-week Singles' Day sales period this year yielded \"a double-digit, year-on-year decline in iPhone sales\", as Apple \"faced pressure from an abnormally high number\" of new flagship smartphone models that domestic competitors launched just before and during the annual shopping extravaganza, according to a report published on Wednesday by Counterpoint Research.\nThe report did not provide the exact percentage drop or the fewer number of iPhone sales that Counterpoint tracked during the event's sales period, which ran from October 28 to November 10.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThis year's Singles' Day debacle for Apple, which saw iPhone 16 prices slashed as part of online promotions, reflects the continued cutthroat competition in the world's biggest smartphone market, where major Chinese handset vendors have already launched on-device artificial intelligence (AI) ahead of the US tech giant.\nThe new iPhone 16 series on display at an Apple Store in Shanghai.

Photo: Shutterstock>\nOverall, Singles' Day smartphone sales this year fell 9 per cent compared with last year, as market demand and consumers' enthusiasm for promotions have been subdued by economic headwinds, according to the Counterpoint report.\nStill, Apple's latest flagship iPhone series has proved popular on the mainland since it hit store shelves in September. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max were the bestselling models during the two-week festival, the report said.\nIn the same two-week sales period, smartphone sales of Huawei Technologies stood out with an \"impressive growth of 7 per cent year on year\", the report said. Counterpoint attributed that performance to \"generous price cuts\" on Huawei's Pura 70 series and Mate 60 series, as well as the newly launched Nova 13 series with the 5G Kirin processor.\nSales of Oppo rose 6 per cent from last year's Singles' Day festival, while those of Vivo grew 5 per cent.\nStory Continues\nBy contrast, sales of Xiaomi decreased 6 per cent and those of Huawei spin-off Honor fell 15 per cent.\nPedestrians walk near an advertisement for the Singles' Day promotion of Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall shopping platform on November 7, 2024.

          "whole_article": "The Q3 reporting cycle has officially ended for the Mag 7 group following the release of Nvidia\u2019s quarterly results yesterday. The group posted strong growth, though post-earnings reactions weren\u2019t favorable for all.\nBut reports from Tesla TSLA and Amazon AMZN did spark post-earnings positivity, with shares of each seeing positive price action following their releases.\nBut what was there to like in each respective release? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nAmazon's AWS Results Impress\nConcerning headline figures in Amazon\u2019s quarterly release, the company exceeded both consensus EPS and sales expectations handily. EPS grew a sizable 70% year-over-year, whereas sales of $60 billion reflected an 11% climb from the year-ago period.\nHowever, the real highlight of the results was the AWS results. AWS sales jumped 19% year-over-year to $27.5 billion, matching the same growth pace we saw last quarter. While the growth pace didn\u2019t reflect an acceleration, the results overall confirm underlying momentum.\nFurther, the profitability picture for AWS jumped higher, with operating income of $9.3 billion well above the $5.4 billion mark in the year-ago period. Below is a\u00a0chart illustrating the company\u2019s AWS results against our consensus expectations, with the recent $27.5 billion print falling $127 million short.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLike Tesla, analysts raised their earnings expectations for Amazon following the favorable release, with the stock boasting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOverall, the company\u2019s dominant stance in the cloud paints a bright outlook for the company, particularly in the midst of this AI frenzy that we\u2019ve all become accustomed to. AWS is the dominant player in the cloud computing market, flexing a significant market share globally. It provides various services, including computing power, storage, databases, and AI/ML tools.\nTesla Sees Higher Profitability\nWhile EV delivery/production numbers were important, the real highlight of the release that caused shares to perk up was margin expansion, with the company\u2019s gross margin expanding nicely to 19.8% vs. a 17.9% print in the same period last year.\nPlease note that the chart\u2019s values are calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNotably, Tesla reported its lowest-ever level of cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle throughout the period, which bodes favorably for upcoming periods as well. Analysts have raised their EPS expectations across the board following the release, with the stock now holding the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe stock\u2019s current momentum is undeniable, partly boosted by the recent U.S. election. Growth is expected to resume in its next fiscal year, with our consensus FY25 expectations suggesting 30% EPS growth on 16% higher sales.\nBottom Line\nWith Nvidia's quarterly release finally out of the way, the Q3 reporting cycle for the broader Mag 7 group has ended. The group overall posted strong growth, though Amazon AMZN and Tesla TSLA were among the few to see post-earnings momentum.\nA notable boost in profitability helped vault Tesla shares higher, with the stock also benefiting from the recent U.S. election. The company overall remains the prime selection for EV exposure, with growth expected to return in a big way during its next fiscal year.\nA strong showing from AWS in Amazon\u2019s release aided the bullish action post-earnings, with the results reflecting underlying momentum. The company remains a solid pick for the AI frenzy given its dominant cloud computing stance, with an upcoming holiday season also potentially providing near-term tailwinds.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected.\nThe report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time.\nNow Nvidia is saying that the chips aren\u2019t just shipping, they\u2019re in the hands of all of the company\u2019s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker\u2019s data center revenue. Ensuring they\u2019re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia\u2019s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nRead more: Nvidia nearly triples in value over 11 months: Is it time to invest?\n\u201cWith any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,\u201d Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u201cAnd I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth\u2019s chips makes it difficult to meet demand.\n\u201cIt is the case that demand exceeds supply,\u201d Huang told analysts. \u201cAnd that\u2019s expected as we\u2019re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.\u201d\nCEO Jensen Huang speaks during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nFor some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.\nThe H100 is Nvidia\u2019s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.\nStory Continues\nAs Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need.\n\u201cNvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,\u201d New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. \u201cAnd so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.\u201d\nIn its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company\u2019s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

          "whole_article": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Amazon (AMZN) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this online retailer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 15.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 78.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 26.4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7.1%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8.8%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions.

Amazon (AMZN) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole?

Collectively, these companies sit at #7 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups, measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group.\nThe Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. Amazon is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nOver the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN's full-year earnings has moved 8.3% higher. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.\nOur latest available data shows that AMZN has returned about 33.5% since the start of the calendar year. At the same time, Retail-Wholesale stocks have gained an average of 24.6%. This means that Amazon is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.\nOne other Retail-Wholesale stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is D-MARKET Electronic Services & Trading Unsponsored ADR (HEPS). The stock is up 55.6% year-to-date.\nFor D-MARKET Electronic Services & Trading Unsponsored ADR, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 40% over the past three months.

Executives also reiterated the company\u2019s guidance from August that sales and profit growth will slow going forward. Its stock slid as much as 10% in early US trading.\nThat downbeat outlook emerged after PDD reported quarterly sales and profit that missed estimates, lending weight to fears that China\u2019s slowdown is hurting its biggest tech companies more than anticipated. The disappointing results highlight how PDD, despite a thriving overseas business anchored by hot shopping app Temu, is grappling with anemic Chinese consumer spending. A quarter ago, PDD issued a surprisingly strong warning about a slowdown in the world\u2019s No. 2 economy and talked up challenges including uncertainties in the global environment.\n\u201cWe will see greater financial impact as we will be disadvantaged against our competitors for some time to come,\u201d PDD Co-Chief Executive Officer Zhao Jiazhen told analysts on a call on Thursday. \u201cOur team of staff is now limited by their past experience and suffers from lack of certain capabilities.\u201d\nThe Chinese-owned e-commerce platform reported revenue of 99.4 billion yuan ($13.7 billion) in the September quarter, versus the average analyst estimate of 102.8 billion yuan. Net income was 25 billion yuan, compared to a projected 26.6 billion yuan.\nPDD\u2019s been spending big on rural markets and Temu to drive its global presence, helping push growth well above that of rivals Alibaba and JD.com Inc. Temu became one of the most downloaded US apps after a splashy 2022 debut, and has begun challenging even Amazon.com Inc. in certain segments.\nBut Temu is also encountering growing scrutiny following its meteoric rise overseas.\nThe European Union has opened an investigation into the e-commerce platform, looking into whether the company is doing enough to combat sales of illegal products. The EU said it suspects the company is violating its new Digital Services Act, a law aimed at stamping out illegal content and disinformation online. It\u2019s also unclear how a Trump administration will wield tariffs as a political tool, potentially disrupting the cross-border trade on which Temu depends.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThere\u2019s uncertainty on potential tariff change and increasing pushback from more countries related to its \u2018cheap\u2019 prices,\u201d Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap wrote ahead of the results. \u201cWhile still growing robustly, Temu is also facing multiple headwinds.\u201d\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nPDD\u2019s first non-GAAP operating profit miss in seven quarters, 12% below consensus estimates for 3Q, may trigger earning cuts of at least 10% through 2025, assuming revenue rise 20% next year vs. about 62% annually from 2021-24. The 61 basis point operating-margin gain in 3Q vs. 1H\u2019s 8.9 percentage points jump raises the risk that rising rivalry from peers such as Alibaba, Amazon and TikTok Shop will hurt profitability in 2025.\n- Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analysts\nClick here for the research.\nAt home, the company in past years has combined low prices with aggressive rural expansion and game-like elements on its platform to grab market share from Alibaba and JD. Those two rivals have recently begun to team up on logistics and payments.\nIt\u2019s also grappling with a consumer and merchant backlash. Sellers are pushing back against PDD\u2019s low-pricing strategy, as well as policies that allow shoppers to get refunds without returning goods. Over the summer, hundreds of merchants staged a rally outside its offices in southern China, protesting what they called unfair penalties on their businesses.\nNongfu Spring\u2019s founder Zhong Shanshan, China\u2019s richest man, this week publicly called out PDD\u2019s pricing system.

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Amazon (AMZN).\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.10, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 50 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.10 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 50 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 46 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 92% and 6% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for AMZN\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Amazon, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs AMZN Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8.4% over the past month to $5.17.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.

          "whole_article": "Netflix's NFLX transformation from a DVD rental service to a streaming giant is taking another significant leap with its ambitious push into live content. The company's recent successes with events like the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match, which drew 108 million average viewers, demonstrate its potential in the live streaming arena. However, technical challenges during these events raise questions about the platform's readiness for major live programming.\nTechnical Infrastructure Concerns\nNetflix's strategic expansion into live streaming, marked by high-profile events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the $5 billion WWE deal, demonstrates its commitment to diversifying content offerings beyond traditional streaming. However, widespread streaming issues and buffering problems plagued many viewers. These technical difficulties are particularly concerning as the company prepares for even bigger events, including two NFL Christmas Day games and the upcoming launch of WWE's Monday Night Raw in 2025.\n\nThe platform's ability to handle large-scale concurrent streaming remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed. Despite these short-term hurdles, Netflix's strong market position, growing advertising business and comprehensive entertainment strategy suggest long-term potential. However, given the significant investments required and execution risks in live programming, investors might benefit from waiting for stronger evidence of successful implementation before increasing exposure.\nStrategic Content Acquisitions\nNetflix's $5 billion deal with WWE for Monday Night Raw represents a significant investment in live programming. Combined with NFL games and special events featuring major entertainers like Beyonc\u00e9, the company is positioning itself as a comprehensive entertainment destination. This diversification strategy could help Netflix maintain its competitive edge in an increasingly crowded streaming landscape.\n\nNetflix expects paid net additions to be higher sequentially in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects substantial growth in paid subscribers, with total paid memberships expected to reach 290.54 million by the end of 2024, indicating an 11.6% year-over-year increase.\nFinancial Implications and Growth Prospects\nThe company expects revenues to grow in the range of 11-13% in 2025, reaching $43-$44 billion. This growth rate represents a slowdown from the 15% expected in 2024. Netflix's investment in live content and infrastructure improvements may pressure margins in the short term, though management targets a 28% operating margin for 2025.\n\nWith total debt reaching $15.98 billion and streaming content obligations at $22.7 billion, Netflix faces significant financial commitments.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $38.91 billion, indicating 15.37% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $19.78 per share, indicating a substantial 64.42% increase from the previous year.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nThe recent surge in Netflix's stock price has led to expanded valuation multiples, potentially limiting future upside for investors. The company's forward 12-month sales multiple of 8.73 exceeds its five-year median of 6.53, indicating that the stock may be trading at a premium to its historical valuation. Moreover, this multiple surpasses the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward earnings multiple of 3.4, suggesting that Netflix's valuation is stretched relative to its peers.\nPrice-to-Sales (Forward 12 Months)\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMarket Position and Competition\nAs traditional media companies increasingly bundle their services, Netflix is taking a different approach by expanding its standalone offering. The addition of live sports and entertainment could help justify future price increases and reduce churn. However, the technical challenges and high costs associated with live programming present risks.\n\nInvestors have responded enthusiastically to Netflix's performance, with NFLX shares returning an impressive 81.5% year to date, significantly outperforming tech giants like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.\nYear-to-date Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Outlook\nWhile Netflix's push into live streaming shows promise, current investors should maintain their positions but new investors might want to wait for a better entry point. The company needs to prove that it can consistently deliver high-quality live streaming experiences before the market fully prices in this growth opportunity. Additionally, the significant investments required for live content rights and technical infrastructure may impact near-term profitability.\nConclusion\nNetflix's venture into live streaming represents both an opportunity and a challenge. While the strategy could strengthen its market position, technical hurdles and high costs suggest caution. Current shareholders should remain invested to benefit from the company's long-term potential, but new investors might find better entry points after Netflix demonstrates consistent execution in live programming delivery. Netflix currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A Florida-based person named Ronald Blue Denton sued Netflix in state court for what he considered a shoddy performance in delivering the event to its clients in sharp craving, stating that Netflix was unstoppably ill-equipped for the demand for the show, making it unwatchable.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Netflix violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and breached the parties' contract while also demanding monetary damages and a class action on behalf of other affected Netflix subscribers. According to Denton, Netflix is guilty of abdicating its role as a service provider since it failed to provide a perfect viewing experience for millions of people.\nThe November 15 fight that Netflix promoted as its primary sports event attracted 108 million viewers worldwide. Nonetheless, many people used social networks to complain about the declining video quality, numerous instances of buffering, and completely frozen streams, especially if the moment in the match was important.\nNetflix included the topic as part of a significant milestone in sports streaming to establish its dominance in the live segment. Denton's lawsuit now appears to potentially overshadow the feat and is symbolic of the dangers of mounting highly visible live events when viewer expectations steadily rise.\nThis legal dispute could try Netflix for various technical problems and issue a challenge to how the company plans to handle mass streaming events as it faces increasing competition in live sports rights. As of yet, the company has not said anything about this lawsuit.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

This record-breaking viewership indicates that it is not only the initial days of the sports that can get a high television viewership. It also points towards the fact that the crossover boxing events are gaining popularity.\nAppealing to entertainment with the help of such talents as Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, using the occasion of streaming, Netflix has identified itself as the major rival in the sphere of live sports streaming and broadcasting.

          "whole_article": "Investors with an interest in Broadcast Radio and Television stocks have likely encountered both Fox Corporation (FOX) and Netflix (NFLX). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\nFox Corporation and Netflix are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FOX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nFOX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.71, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 44.06. We also note that FOX has a PEG ratio of 1.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.68.\nAnother notable valuation metric for FOX is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 16.39.\nBased on these metrics and many more, FOX holds a Value grade of A, while NFLX has a Value grade of D.\nFOX sticks out from NFLX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FOX is the better option right now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX).\nNetflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.91, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.91 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.1% and 4.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NFLX\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Netflix, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NFLX a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $19.78.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Netflix.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

An index of US-listed Chinese stocks fell 1% Thursday, running against the grain of trading in New York but partly reflecting selling in Hong Kong stocks in their most recent session.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both rose Thursday.

The Japanese currency edged higher early Friday as inflation in Japan held above the central bank\u2019s target as expected.\nStory Continues\nElsewhere in Asia, investors will be monitoring the fallout from a US indictment against Gautam Adani over allegations of bribery.

          "whole_article": "Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster shared his views about NVIDIA (NVDA)'s earnings call yesterday. Here is a summary of his thoughts:\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s earnings report provides insight into the company\u2019s growth trajectory, highlighting the aspects that matter and those that don\u2019t. The company delivered $35 billion in revenue for the October quarter, meeting whisper numbers, and issued a January guidance of $37.5 billion, slightly below the whisper number of $38 billion. Gross margins dipped a bit too, but ultimately these numbers don't matter as much.\nThe AI star lies in a boom or bust industry. Before the generative AI excitement, the company\u2019s business declined 21% year-over-year. However, Nvidia\u2019s market cap has skyrocketed since, driven by the extraordinary demand for its Blackwell GPUs.\nThe true pressure point for Nvidia lies in the commentary about Blackwell, Nvidia\u2019s generative AI architecture. Looking at the key commentary from Nvidia\u2019s CFO, we find that demand for Blackwell will continue to exceed supply for several quarters. There have also been some supply difficulties, albeit quite small.\u00a0 This narrative has evolved positively compared to the October earnings call, with supply constraints expected to ease slightly earlier\u2014from \u201cinto 2025\u201d to \u201cmid-2025.\u201d\nAdditionally, the earnings call mentions twice that the demand for Blackwell has grown even stronger over the past three months, setting up 2025 as a robust year. While this doesn\u2019t provide complete visibility into 2026, it does base a strong foundation for continued momentum.\nDriving Nvidia\u2019s growth is the principle of scaling laws. Scaling is what's effectively needed to make AI models smarter. Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, likened this to Moore\u2019s Law, where CPU speeds doubled every few years even though it was expected otherwise. The industry\u2019s continuous innovation and adherence to scaling principles are bound to propel Nvidia\u2019s AI computing demand, reinforcing the long-term outlook.\nWall Street projects 20% year-over-year growth for calendar year 2026. Based on Nvidia\u2019s trajectory, Deepwater anticipates this could accelerate to over 30% growth, stating that there is plenty of time for the business to appreciate.\nOur research director shared his views on NVDA's earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nStory Continues\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. assured investors that its new product lineup will continue to fuel an artificial intelligence-driven growth run, while also signaling that the rush to get chips out the door is proving costlier than expected.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy\nParis to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees\nTokyo\u2019s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\nNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes\nNew York\u2019s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll\nListen to the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nSpeaking after the release of quarterly results, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said that Nvidia\u2019s highly anticipated Blackwell products will ship this quarter amid \u201cvery strong\u201d demand. But the production and engineering costs of the chips will weigh on profit margins, and Nvidia\u2019s sales forecast for the current period didn\u2019t match some of Wall Street\u2019s more optimistic projections.\nThat brought a tepid reaction from investors, who had bid up Nvidia shares almost 200% this year heading into the earnings report. After that dizzying rally, which turned the chipmaker into the world\u2019s most valuable company, anything but a blowout quarter was bound to be a disappointment.\nThe shares fell as much as 3.6% on Thursday before rebounding by the afternoon. They closed up 0.5% at $146.67.\nNvidia predicted fiscal fourth-quarter sales of about $37.5 billion. While the average analyst estimate was $37.1 billion, projections ranged as high as $41 billion.\n\u201cThe guidance seems to show lower growth, but this may be Nvidia being conservative,\u201d said Alvin Nguyen, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. \u201cShort term, there is no worry about AI demand. Nvidia is doing everything they should be doing.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s biggest moneymaker is its accelerator chip, which helps develop artificial intelligence models by bombarding them with data. Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot debuted in 2022, a frenzy of AI services has created insatiable demand for the product.\nAll About Nvidia Chips, AI Hype and What Lies Ahead: QuickTake\nWall Street has been closely watching the launch of Blackwell, the latest entry in that category, which is faster and has an improved ability to link up with other semiconductors. Manufacturing challenges have slowed the rollout, and Nvidia warned again of supply constraints on Wednesday. Demand for the products is expected to exceed supply for several quarters.\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nStory Continues\nHuang said that Blackwell is now in \u201cfull production,\u201d and there\u2019s still an appetite for Hopper, the previous design. \u201cBlackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners,\u201d he said during the conference call.\nBut the switch to Blackwell has taken a toll on profitability. The company\u2019s gross margin, which measures the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, will dip to as low as 73% this quarter from 75% in the previous period. The figure is expected to rebound when the new products reach larger-scale production, and the economics are more favorable.\nWhen asked whether Nvidia\u2019s gross margin could be back in the mid-70s by the middle of next year, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that\u2019s a reasonable assumption. Nvidia remains far above its peers in this category: Its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has a gross margin that\u2019s 20 percentage points narrower. Intel Corp.\u2019s isn\u2019t even half of Nvidia\u2019s total.\nNvidia\u2019s growth over the past two years has been staggering. Its sales are poised to double for a second year in a row, and it now notches more money in profit than it used to generate in total revenue.\nNvidia\u2019s revenue rose 94% to $35.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 27. Excluding certain items, profit was 81 cents a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $33.25 billion and earnings of 74 cents a share.\nNvidia\u2019s biggest division, the data center unit, saw revenue double from a year earlier to $30.8 billion. That beat Wall Street estimates.\nBut networking revenue within that unit declined sequentially, and the business is more dependent than ever on a small group of customers: cloud service providers. That cohort, which includes companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS, accounted for 50% of data center revenue, up from 45% in the prior period.\nInvestors want that number to go down, to show that the use of AI is spreading across the economy.\nOther recent earnings reports have given strong signals for AI. Nvidia customers, including Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc., have reaffirmed their commitment to spend heavily on AI infrastructure.\nWATCH: Nvidia's Surprising AI Origin Story\nNvidia has only missed analysts\u2019 estimates on quarterly revenue once in the past five years. And it has exceeded expectations by as much as 20% in recent periods, creating a high bar for its performance.\nIts data center division alone now has more revenue than rivals Intel and AMD have in total, combined. Net income this year is on course to exceed revenue at Intel, a business that was the chip industry\u2019s biggest company for decades.\nNvidia made its name by selling graphics processors, but discovered that the technology also has applications for AI. Its chips help software models during the training process, when they learn to recognize and respond to real-world inputs. Nvidia\u2019s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as ChatGPT.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company has rapidly expanded its product lineup to include networking, software and services, as well as fully built-out computer systems. Huang is traveling the world lobbying for a broader adoption of his technology and trying to spread its use by corporations and government agencies.\n\u201cThe age of AI is upon us and it\u2019s large and diverse,\u201d Huang said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nJaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers\nClear\u2019s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End\nAn Airline\u2019s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare\nWhy \u2018Premiumization\u2019 Has Made Flying So Much Better\u2014and Worse\nTrump and the Triumph of America\u2019s New Elite\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Artificial intelligence (AI) could help British businesses offset the soaring costs of recent Budget measures by boosting productivity, Google\u2019s UK boss has said.\nDebbie Weinstein, vice-president and managing director for Google UK and Ireland, said companies facing surging costs from higher national insurance contributions and the national minimum wage hike announced by the Chancellor last month can use AI to \u201crun their businesses more effectively\u201d.\nFears are mounting that firms will have to put up prices and axe staff in response to the extra costs from the Budget moves, while the increasing use of AI is already seen by many workers as a threat to jobs.\nBut Ms Weinstein told the PA news agency that AI is a way for firms to boost the productivity of their existing teams and spur on growth, which will help counter the cost pressures they face.\nGoogle believes that AI could help the average UK small firm boost their productivity by 20%, effectively adding an extra digital employee to a team of five.\nShe said: \u201cDriving productivity and making sure you\u2019re making the most of your employees is really important for businesses.\u201d\nRather than firms using AI to cut their workforces, she said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is that people are using AI to enhance the work of their existing teams and allowing their team members to do more activities.\u201d\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about costs, but more productivity from existing staff.\n\u201cThe people in those teams are able to drive more growth for those businesses.\u201d\nBut she added: \u201cI acknowledge the fears that people have about \u2018how will it disrupt the job that I\u2019m doing today?\u2019.\n\u201cThe research we have is that most jobs will be augmented by AI.\u201d\nShe said that workers are not competing with AI, but instead competing with others who can \u201cuse AI better\u201d in their job.\nGoogle is running a pilot with small firms to help increase the take-up of AI within workforces, using behavioural science to help drive the programme.\nIt has teamed up with small firm support platform and membership community Enterprise Nation, the Grind Coffee chain and behavioural science expert and London School of Economics professor Grace Lordan for the three-month project.\nThe initiative will see it offer 750 workers across small firms a free programme designed to train them in the use of AI in their everyday work.\nMinister for AI Feryal Clark said AI will be \u2018key to kick-starting growth\u2019 (David Woolfall/UK Parliament/PA)\nMs Weinstein cautioned that small businesses risk being left behind in the adoption of AI due to a lack of training and time invested in helping their staff use new tools.\nMs Weinstein said: \u201cMany of these businesses are made up of lean teams with global ambitions that could use AI to help level the playing field, but only if their teams are equipped with the skills needed to harness the power of this technology.\u201d\nStory continues\nIt will use bespoke short webinars and on-the-job training under the programme to help workers develop new working habits using AI.\nGoogle aims to use the findings of the trial for further training programmes, but also feed back to the Government to help with up-skilling the wider UK workforce in the use of AI.\nLabour\u2019s new minister for AI, Feryal Clark, said: \u201cSpeeding up the diffusion of AI throughout our economy will be key to kick-starting growth, transforming our public services and delivering new opportunities for working people across the country.\n\u201cJust as important, is making sure we bring people along with us and build a workforce which is fit for the future.\u201d"

          "whole_article": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced a strong Q3 2024 earnings release, reporting revenue of $88.3 billion, up 15% year-over-year (YoY). Such growth points to the firm standing on solid ground in digital advertising and, increasingly, in cloud service.\nIndeed, Alphabet's main segments, Google Services and Google Cloud, remained the main drivers of such growth, showing that the company can keep its revenue streams strong in an increasingly competitive space.\nGoogle Cloud Powers Up: 35% Revenue Growth and $1.95B Profit Surge\nAlphabet's Google Cloud segment continues to perform exceptionally well, reporting a 35% year-over-year revenue growth, reaching $11.35 billion. This growth underlines Alphabet's competitive advantage in the enterprise technology space, especially with business enterprises increasingly relying on cloud-based infrastructures and AI solutions. Alphabet's CEO Sundar Pichai attributed the growth to strategic investments in AI infrastructure and advanced Generative AI tools, addressing the fast-evolving demands of enterprise clients in data analytics, machine learning, and automation.\nOperating income at Google Cloud expanded to hit $1.95 billion against just $266 million in Q3 2023. This case reflects how Alphabet has achieved economies of scale within the cloud segment because of the higher value accruing from the services being offered and, as a result, better efficiency in operations. As more and more customers flock to Google Cloud, winning new customers and earning bigger contracts, Alphabet continues to gain market share.\nAlphabet's AI Investments Pay Off\nAlphabet Shines: Google Services Hits $76.5B with YouTube Ads and Subscriptions Soaring Amid Competition\nGoogle Services, which includes Google Search, YouTube, subscriptions, platforms, and devices, was $76.5 billion, up 13% YoY. Google Search and other ad revenues leaped to $49.4 billion, a gain of 12%, reflecting the durability of its advertising platform. During a period where AI-powered startups and social media upstarts challenged their dominance, Alphabet continued to focus on continuous innovation through AI-driven enhancements with Search, holding onto market position and ad dollars.\nYouTube ads also grew 12% to $8.92 billion. With YouTube's total ads and subscription revenue surpassing $50 billion over the last four quarters, Alphabet has now truly positioned YouTube as one of the premier video advertising platforms. This really shows that YouTube has been very resilient to changes in user and advertiser preferences, especially with the rising competition from its competitors, including TikTok and Reels.\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's subscription, platforms, and devices segment delivered an impressive 28% growth, reaching $10.7 billion. This surge highlights Alphabet's ability to diversify its revenue streams beyond traditional ad-based services, leveraging its ecosystem to drive value from hardware and consumer subscriptions, such as Google One and YouTube Premium.\nOperating income Jumps 34%, with Margins Rising Amid Disciplined Cost Management\nAlphabet's commitment to improving operational efficiency was evident, as operating income surged by 34% to $28.5 billion. The operating margin increased to 32%, up from 28% a year ago, showing Alphabet's success in controlling costs while driving revenue growth. Total expenses rose by just under 8%, reaching $59.75 billion, indicating Alphabet's disciplined approach to managing its cost base, particularly in high-growth segments like cloud and AI infrastructure.\nAdditionally, Alphabet's bottom line was bolstered by a notable increase in other income, which contributed $3.2 billion, compared to a $146 million expense in the same quarter last year. This improvement in non-operating income reflects Alphabet's enhanced financial performance beyond core operating metrics, further strengthening its balance sheet.\nAlphabet's Valuation Signals Caution: Fairly Priced but Premium Multiples Limit Near-Term Upside\nAccording to recent valuation metrics, Alphabet appears fairly valued but shows elevated multiples relative to industry peers. Its GF Value is estimated at $166, indicating that the current stock price aligns with fair value. However, a Price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 23 and forward P/E of 20 place Alphabet at a premium in its sector.\nWith a PEG ratio of 1.1, Alphabet's future high-growth potential may be limiteda caution for growth-focused investors. Additionally, a Price-to-Sales ratio of 6.7 and Price-to-Book ratio of 7.45 suggest significant growth expectations are already factored in. Finally, the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 40 signals an optimistic, if not stretched, valuation, especially given Alphabet's extensive capital outlays in AI and cloud infrastructure.\nRising Costs and Intense Competition Weigh on Near-Term Profitability Despite Long-Term AI Ambitions\nOne of the primary risks facing Alphabet is its rising Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), which increased by 6.1% year-over-year to $13.7 billion. TAC represents the expenses Alphabet incurs to drive traffic to its platforms, and its continued growth could pressure Alphabet's advertising profit margins. Additionally, Alphabet's capital expenditures (CapEx) surged 71.9% to $13.06 billion, largely allocated to AI infrastructure investments. This rapid increase in CapEx, while supporting Alphabet's long-term AI strategy, could challenge short-term profitability if revenue growth does not keep pace with investment.\nAlphabet operates in an intensely competitive environment, with section starvation coming from all corners, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This AI-driven transformation has put Google Cloud and Search in a great position against Alphabet's flight for retention. Furthermore, considering the fast-paced traffic, Alphabet continues to have more work ahead to really push through its position.\nMeanwhile, the number one and two positions remain with Cloud Azure from Microsoft-MSFT and Amazon Web Services from AMZN, respectively. Any deceleration in growth at Google Cloud or delays in AI-related product development will hurt Alphabet's market share capture and its ability to maintain its competitive edge.\nAccording to the tech expert, Jason Wise Alphabet's rising TAC and significantly higher AI-focused CapEx suggest an ambitious, long-term growth strategy, but such high levels of spending will also challenge near-term margins. After all, to be successful, Alphabet now must turn these investments into revenue-generating digital ad and cloud product innovations. While effective monetization could provide tremendous future returns, delays or unfavorable shifts in markets may well test Alphabet's valuation.\nThat said, Alphabet remains a great long-term hold based on strong revenue streams and very fast-growing AI and cloud technology exposure. Moreover, increasing costs at a rapid pace, extended valuations relative to the peer universe, and competitiveness pressures also pose risks holding near-term growth in check. Investors will want to remain focused on cost structure, investment returns, and competitive dynamics as Alphabet pursues its next leg of growth.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "By Deborah Mary Sophia, Akash Sriram, Kenrick Cai\n(Reuters) -Efforts by U.S. antitrust regulators to break up Alphabet by forcing a sale of its Google Chrome browser and other proposals to limit its search dominance are likely to run into legal challenges on grounds the remedies are extreme.\nAfter a ruling in August that Google illegally monopolized the search market, U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors argued to a judge on Wednesday that the company must sell Chrome, share data and search results with rivals and possibly sell its Android smartphone software.\nAlphabet shares closed nearly 5% lower on Thursday.\nThe proposals are part of a landmark case aimed at reshaping how users find information. But a new pro-business administration of President-elect Donald Trump next year could change that effort and legal proceedings could last years, experts said.\n\"It would strike me as an over-ask,\" said Kevin Walkush at Jensen Investment Management, which holds Google stock and is skeptical a Chrome divestiture will happen. \"You ask for everything possible, not necessarily with an eye towards what would be probable and proportional, and then see what sticks.\"\nThe DOJ sought and won a breakup of Microsoft in the early 2000s after alleging it illegally monopolized the web browser market. That ruling was overturned by an appeals court, and Microsoft and the DOJ eventually settled.\nWalkush expects the Google case to take years to play out as the company appeals. \"The wheels of justice do not turn quickly,\" he said.\nGoogle called the DOJ's approach \"unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses,\" giving as examples diminished user privacy and less funding for companies such as browser maker Mozilla when they feature Google search.\nThe case could also face challenges from Trump.\nWhile Trump's administration originally filed the search case against Google during his first term, he indicated in October he might not break up the company because it could hurt the American tech industry at a time competition is heating up with China in areas including AI.\nRepresentatives for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n'SUBSTANTIAL HEADWINDS'\nChrome, the most widely used web browser, is a pillar of Google's business, providing the company with valuable user data that helps it target ads. The search ads business brought in more than half of Alphabet's total revenue of $88.3 billion in the latest quarter.\nStory Continues\nThe value of Chrome, estimated to hold about two-thirds of the global browser market, diminishes sharply as a standalone browser.\n\"The reason why it's valuable to Google is because Google uses it to enhance its ad business and its search business,\" said Megan Gray, former general counsel at search rival DuckDuckGO who has also worked as an attorney at the Federal Trade Commission. \"If you don't have those, then Chrome would just be a data broker.\"\nA forced sale would not address several key issues raised in the DOJ lawsuit, including a search monopoly, critics say. U.S. antitrust enforcers, who are also pursuing Apple and Amazon in other monopoly cases, would have to approve any potential Chrome buyer.\n\"DOJ will face substantial headwinds with this remedy,\" because Chrome can run search engines other than Google, said Gus Hurwitz, senior fellow and academic director at University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. \"Courts expect any remedy to have a causal connection to the underlying antitrust concern. Divesting Chrome does absolutely nothing to address this concern.\"\nThe DOJ proposed a blanket ban on Google offering incentives to give its search engine preferential treatment. That would include Google's lucrative partnership with Apple, where it pays the smartphone maker billions of dollars annually to make Google Search the default on Apple smartphones.\nEvercore analysts called the proposed curbs \"draconian.\"\nGiven Google Search's popularity, Apple is likely to continue with Google as the default search engine even without any agreement or payments, Hurwitz said.\nDOJ's proposals also include demands for Google to license search results at a nominal cost and share the user data it gathers with competitors for free.\nD.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said it was harder to ascertain the impact of Google having to open up its search data until the terms are clearer. The Center for Journalism & Liberty said Google licensing its search data would be \"transformative\" for news publishers because it would help them better understand their audiences.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Kenrick Cai in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Jody Godoy and Chris Sanders in Washington; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh, Aditya Soni and Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Nvidia (NVDA) is assuaging Wall Street\u2019s concerns about any potential slowdowns in the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip, telling investors during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that it\u2019s on pace to exceed its previous revenue estimates for the current quarter.\n\u201cBlackwell production is in full steam,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. \u201cI think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.\u201d\nPrior to the earnings call, The Information reported on Nov. 17 that Nvidia was contending with overheating issues related to its Blackwell-based servers leading suppliers to adjust the design of the racks that house the servers. Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected.\nThe report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time.\nNow Nvidia is saying that the chips aren\u2019t just shipping, they\u2019re in the hands of all of the company\u2019s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker\u2019s data center revenue. Ensuring they\u2019re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia\u2019s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nRead more: Nvidia nearly triples in value over 11 months: Is it time to invest?\n\u201cWith any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,\u201d Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u201cAnd I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth\u2019s chips makes it difficult to meet demand.\n\u201cIt is the case that demand exceeds supply,\u201d Huang told analysts. \u201cAnd that\u2019s expected as we\u2019re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.\u201d\nCEO Jensen Huang speaks during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nFor some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.\nThe H100 is Nvidia\u2019s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.\nStory Continues\nAs Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need.\n\u201cNvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,\u201d New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. \u201cAnd so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.\u201d\nIn its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company\u2019s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other Jim Cramer's latest stock picks you shouldn't miss.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about earnings results from some of the top consumer and retail companies and said, as a compliment, that America has become a nation of \u201ccheapskates\u201d where consumers are unwilling to pay more when there\u2019s little or no value.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something happening here, and what it is is exactly clear: we\u2019ve become a nation of cheapskates. I say that as a compliment. Nobody gets away with charging too much anymore\u2014not in this country, no matter the industry, perhaps even the drug industry. It\u2019s happening now, it\u2019s happening fast, and many companies are being left behind by the change. I see it everywhere I go\u2014in the grocery store, online, in the mall, and, of course, in the stock market.\u201d\nCramer talked about how restaurants that offer cheaper but quality meals are seeing a surge in their stock prices amid rising revenues. He also discussed how weight-loss drugs are impacting companies that sell alcohol products.\n\u201cAmerican people are tired of paying up. They feel gou, they feel betrayed, they feel that the only thing about brand loyalty is that it isn\u2019t worth a dime. They want a better deal. They\u2019ll eagerly switch lifetime habits in order to save some money because prices are up so much that you feel like an idiot if you\u2019re paying up.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nJim Cramer Agrees With Famous Analyst\u2019s Latest Bull Thesis on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC said he agrees with the latest bull case thesis on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson, who said the stock is undervalued. Nathanson also believes fears around Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) search business amid threats from ChatGPT and Perplexity are overstated.\nStory Continues\nDuring an interview with CNBC, the analyst said:\n\u201cWe also thought that the fears about competition from ChatGPT or Perplexity were overdone.. So, Alphabet\u2019s doubled their efforts over the past year, rolling out new products. But if you look at what they\u2019re doing now in search with AI overviews, it seems to be working.\u201d\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported strong quarterly results recently. The results show that the market has been ignoring the company\u2019s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught.\nGoogle\u2019s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. Currently, Google\u2019s stock trades below 20 times forward earnings, offering potential upside as EPS and other financial metrics strengthen in coming years. For next year, the consensus EPS estimate sits around $9. However, Google has consistently beaten projections, delivering $7.54 in trailing twelve-month EPS compared to the expected $6.79\u2014a roughly 11% outperformance.\nWith the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google\u2019s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon were also top absolute detractors. Alphabet\u2019s better-than-expected results were overshadowed by an adverse ruling related to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (\u201cDoJ\u201d) anti-trust case against the company. We expected an adverse ruling and are monitoring potential remedies recommended by the DoJ and subsequently ruled on by the judge. This will likely take a few years to play out; in the meantime, we see many mitigating factors that the company can pursue to protect its competitive position and growth. We trimmed our positions in Alphabet and Microsoft by 1.5% each to fund the purchase of Oracle. They both remain top five holdings at the new weights.\u201d\nOverall, GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's latest stock picks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

The provision is intended to apply to Google\u2019s Anthropic investment, according to people familiar with the Justice Department\u2019s thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private information.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s proposals are part of a broader effort to curb Google\u2019s alleged monopoly over online search.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI stocks to watch according to latest news and ratings.\nArtificial intelligence businesses have taken Wall Street by storm in the past few months.

However, the company is facing multiple lawsuits regarding the use of data from news publications without attribution.

With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.\nStory Continues\nAs Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need.\n\u201cNvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,\u201d New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. \u201cAnd so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.\u201d\nIn its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company\u2019s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks that are dominating headlines.\nAI stocks are soaring and AI startups are receiving billions in funding from venture capital firms as the new technology sweeps investors off their feet. However, as the AI boom plays out, the central bank in Europe has issued a dire warning about the development of an AI bubble. The warning was included in the biannual Financial Stability Review, a report that lists the risks that could threaten the financial well being of world markets. In the review, the European Central Bank noted that the stock market, particularly in the United States, had become increasingly dependent on a handful of companies perceived as the beneficiaries of the AI boom.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPer the ECB, this concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble. It added that in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointing. The ECB further underlined that investors were demanding a low premium to own shares and bonds while funds had cut their cash buffers. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments, the ECB said.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Wherever C3.ai CEO Tom Siebel goes he fields the same question about the future of AI.\n\u201cEverybody's asking me about it, \u2018Is there a bubble here?\u2019 Absolutely there's a bubble. It's huge,\u201d he tells Fortune in an exclusive interview at C3.ai\u2019s New York offices in a Midtown WeWork.\nOver the last two years, analysts have pondered whether AI companies, both public and private, could possibly live up to their lofty valuations. Tom Siebel, who built his career in Silicon Valley as a sales executive at Oracle before leaving to start his own company that he eventually sold back to his former employer for $5.8 billion, the current state of AI reminded him of the dot-com bubble. Even then a great and wondrous technology\u2014the internet\u2014couldn\u2019t save a host of companies from coming crashing down.\n\u201cSo we have this similar thing going on with generative AI that we've seen with previous technologies,\u201d Siebel said. \u201cThe market is way, way overvaluing.\u201d\nTech analysts that Fortune spoke to broadly agreed with Siebel\u2019s point that valuations across the industry were inflated. \u201cFor now, virtually every notable AI company enjoys a fair degree of investor hype,\u201d said Sandeep Rao, senior researcher at Leverage Shares, a provider of ETPs.\nC3.ai specializes in enterprise AI applications that help companies with various business functions like optimizing their supply chain, predictive maintenance, and tracking their sales process. It also has a spate of lucrative government contracts with the likes of the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force. Among its biggest private sector customers are oil and gas giant Shell and energy company Baker Hughes (whose contract is up for renewal soon).\nEarlier this week C3.ai added another blue chip partner to its ranks when it announced a partnership with Microsoft. Fortune\u2019s interview with Siebel was conducted before the partnership was publicly revealed. (Alan Murray the former CEO of Fortune Media is on the board of C3.ai).\nIn particular, Siebel took aim at OpenAI, the startup with close ties to Microsoft and that is perhaps most closely associated with the AI revolution. OpenAI currently has a $157 billion valuation after an October funding round in which it raised $6 billion. Siebel wasn\u2019t impressed by that valuation.\n\u201cNobody would be surprised if that company disappeared next Monday,\u201d he said.\nWhen Fortune ventured that industry observers would be surprised, Siebel responded that it had \u201cdisappeared\u201d over Thanksgiving, a reference to the brief ouster of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in 2023.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf it disappeared, it wouldn't make any difference in the world,\u201d Siebel said of OpenAI. \u201cNothing would change. I mean, nobody's life would change. No company would change. Microsoft would find something else to power Copilot. There's like 10 other products available that would do it equally as good.\u201d\nThe OpenAI brand name has cachet because it was first to market, but that alone can\u2019t guarantee its market position in perpetuity, said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETF, an exchange-traded fund based out of Greenwich, Conn. \u201cJust because you're very well known doesn't mean that you can't be copied, replicated, and maybe even surpassed,\u201d Marino said.\nIn Rao\u2019s view, there are differences between large language models, but they are difficult to understand. \u201cLLMs are highly proprietary and nailing down definitive distinctions isn\u2019t easy,\u201d he said.\nTheir success, he added, is often due just as much to their business relationships as it is to their underlying tech. \u201cAn LLM\u2019s advantage isn\u2019t necessarily dictated by quality but could be dictated by low cost barriers and ease of use with existing tech instead,\u201d Rao said.\nIn this regard, OpenAI certainly fits the bill, having established deep ties with Microsoft.\nOpenAI did not respond to a request for comment regarding Siebel\u2019s comments.\nSiebel sees overvaluations throughout early stage AI startups as well.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long list of AI startups out of Illinois, Wisconsin, Stanford, that are being financed today on Sand Hill Road, where very little ideas by people who are highly inexperienced, who are going to build generative AI applications for dentist office, veterinarians, or divorce lawyers and these ideas are being financed at multi-billion dollar valuations,\u201d Siebel said. They\u2019re \u201cjust five people who don't know anything [with] four pages of a business plan. This is crazy.\u201d\nOver the last few years, a spate of AI startups with highly specific use cases has cropped up, some of which have indeed sold or raised money at large valuations. Their track records have been a mixed bag. In August 2023, Casetext, which specializes in AI for legal work, sold to Thomson Reuters for $650 million. JasperAI, a startup focused on AI for marketing departments, raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in a Series A in June 2023 only to cut its internal valuation three months later, according to The Information.\nExempt from Siebel\u2019s criticism are the major tech giants developing their own suite of AI products. Microsoft and Amazon, he said, are \u201cgreat companies\u201d that aren\u2019t overvalued. Neither are chipmakers Nvidia and TSMC. \u201cIf TSMC went out of business it would be the end of the world,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked where C3.ai belongs, Siebel naturally has no doubts. \u201cC3.ai is a bargain, okay? I mean, it's a value stock buddy,\u201d he said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other Ken Griffin's portfolio stocks to buy.\nOne of Wall Street\u2019s Greatest\nKen Griffin, the visionary founder of\u00a0Citadel Investment Group, launched his hedge fund in 1990 with $4.2 million, achieving unprecedented success. In 2022, Griffin\u2019s fund delivered an extraordinary 153% return, driven by accurate bets on inflation and interest rates. With a portfolio now exceeding $518 billion, Citadel Investment Group is one of Wall Street\u2019s most closely watched hedge funds, consistently achieving over 25% annual returns since 2016. Citadel employs a multi-strategy investment approach, combining long and short positions to capitalize on market opportunities.\u00a0Its flagship fund, Wellington, anchors Citadel\u2019s operations by investing across multiple asset classes and sectors, emphasizing diversification. In 2022, Wellington achieved an impressive 38% return, building on 26% in 2021 and 24% in 2020. Notably, the fund posted a 19.4% gain in 2019, more than double its 9.1% return in 2018.\nWhile Griffin\u2019s legacy is strongly tied to Citadel\u2019s hedge fund, a significant portion of his Forbes-calculated net worth comes from Citadel Securities, valued at $22 billion after Sequoia and Paradigm acquired a small stake two years ago. Citadel Securities has redefined modern trading, challenging the traditional dominance of big banks. In just two decades, it has become the largest stock buyer and seller in the U.S.; in August, it facilitated more equity trading within its electronic network than the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s main market. In 2023, Citadel Securities generated $2.8 billion in profit from $6.3 billion in net revenue, with an impressive $4.9 billion in net revenue achieved in the first half of 2024 alone.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Cathie Wood\u2019s 11 Favorite AI Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer November Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks.\nThe billionaire also ranks among the top donors to outside spending groups for the 2024 election, which secured former President Donald Trump a second term. As the founder and CEO of Citadel, he contributed $100 million to conservative causes, making him the fifth-largest individual contributor to federal election spending, according to Federal Election Commission data. While Griffin has donated millions to Republican candidates, particularly since 2022, he has notably refrained from directly supporting Trump\u2019s campaign.

Its products are distributed through OEMs, distributors, resellers, and directly via digital marketplaces, online platforms, and retail stores.\nIn FY25 Q1, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) posted $65.6 billion in revenue, a 16% year-over-year increase. The strong start to the fiscal year was fueled by Microsoft Cloud, which generated $38.9 billion in revenue. Segment-wise, Productivity and Business Processes revenue grew 12%, Intelligent Cloud rose 20%, and More Personal Computing increased by 17%, year-over-year.\nOn October 31, Citi reaffirmed its Buy rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a price target of $497, despite a mixed quarterly performance. The company exceeded top and bottom-line expectations, driven by a 1-2% revenue boost from Azure cloud services and a 5% rise in EPS, supported by 23% year-over-year growth in commercial bookings. However, the results were influenced by one-off factors like favorable revenue recognition and foreign exchange rates. Additionally, Microsoft\u2019s Q2 guidance fell short of analyst expectations due to new capacity constraints with a collocation partner, which is projected to slow Azure\u2019s growth by 1-2 percentage points.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $147 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. Shares gave back some gains from strong performance over the first half of this year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported a strong quarter with total revenue growing 16%, in line with the Street; Microsoft Cloud up 22%; Azure up 30%; 43% operating income margins; and 36% free cash flow margins. Core Azure growth came in one point shy of expectations, however, due to a soft European market and continued constraints on AI compute capacity. In the same vein, while Microsoft reiterated its fiscal 2025 targets of double-digit top-line and operating income growth, quarterly guidance called for Azure growth to slow a bit before accelerating in the back half of the fiscal year, as capital expenditures increase, yielding an expansion of AI compute capacity. We believe this investment is a leading indicator for growth, with more than half of the spend related to durable land and data center build outs, which should monetize over the next 15-plus years. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes, and we remain investors.\u201d\nOverall, MSFT ranks 8th on our list of Ken Griffin's portfolio stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "Over the past several years, Big Tech firms like Google and Microsoft have trumpeted ambitious plans to go carbon-neutral, or even carbon-negative, by 2030. But then the generative-AI boom came along and threw a giant wrench in their plans.\nAI models such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Google\u2019s Gemini, which underpin this latest tech craze, suck up vast amounts of energy. In the race to develop better models, with the help of more data centers to train and operate them, companies will need a lot more power to come online, and soon.\nOne way Big Tech hopes to achieve this, while also keeping its commitment to carbon-free emissions, is by tapping a source that has been much maligned in the U.S.: nuclear power.\nIn recent months, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all signed deals to help boost the development of new reactors and restart decommissioned ones. Their agreements are a huge endorsement for the nuclear industry and a sign that the tide against it may be turning.\nBut getting these ambitious projects to the finish line is far from assured, if the industry\u2019s track record is any guide. Of the 94 reactors currently active in the U.S., only four were built within the past three decades.\nPublic opposition over safety and questions about long-term storage of radioactive waste have made building new nuclear facilities almost a nonstarter. The industry is also facing competition from increasingly cheaper renewable energy that has made nuclear far less attractive financially.\nBut with the rise of artificial intelligence, and its huge demand for electricity, supporters of nuclear energy feel they have a new opening. And the tech industry has become their new best friend.\nThe rising impact of data centers on the electrical grid, in many cases to fuel artificial intelligence, is dramatic. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs predicted that server farms would suck up 8% of all U.S. electricity by 2030, up from just 3% in 2022. The data center boom is already a prime reason for soaring power costs across the country.\nBig Tech\u2019s rapid expansion into AI threatens to overwhelm grids and \u201cblow apart\u201d the sector\u2019s climate promises, argues Tyson Slocum, energy program director at consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which opposes nuclear energy. \u201cTheir Hail Mary is nukes.\u201d\nAmong the sector\u2019s attractions are its nearly carbonless footprint and around-the-clock availability, in contrast to solar and wind, which generate electricity that fluctuates depending on the elements. And the argument for it isn\u2019t entirely based on AI and data centers, but also on the rise of electric vehicle charging and the electrification of heating.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe demand picture has changed so radically that the economics actually get helped out a lot,\u201d says Bobby Hollis, Microsoft\u2019s vice president of energy.\nThere is plenty of enthusiasm among lawmakers for this potential nuclear revival. Last December, 25 countries including the U.S. signed a declaration calling for the tripling of nuclear-energy generation by 2050.\nThen this year, the U.S. passed the Advance Act, which promises to simplify the permitting process for new nuclear reactors. Traditional reactors have taken as long as a decade to approve, which adds to their already huge cost.\nA big part of the nuclear revival hinges on what are known as small modular reactors, or SMRs, a largely unproven technology. They involve mini reactors that are made in factories and assembled on-site, which would theoretically speed up the notoriously lengthy process of building nuclear plants.\n\u201cMini,\u201d however, is a relative term. The reactors can still be as big as an office building.\nSo far, there are no functioning SMRs in the U.S. The only examples are a few that recently went live in Russia and China.\nIn October, Google kicked off tech\u2019s dealmaking for SMR-produced energy by signing an agreement with Kairos Power, which promises to deliver six or seven reactors between 2030 and 2035.\nJust two days later, Amazon gave X-energy, another startup hoping to introduce SMRs, a high-profile lift by anchoring a $500 million investment round in the company. The e-commerce giant has also plowed money into public power agency Energy Northwest\u2019s nuclear project in Washington, due in 2031, which would be powered by SMRs built by X-energy.\nBut many are unconvinced that SMRs are the answer. \u201cWe still have to see how much they cost and how well the designs being marketed actually work,\u201d says David Schlissel, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think tank that is skeptical about nuclear power.\nGreg Cullen, a vice president at Amazon SMR partner Energy Northwest, acknowledged the possibility that early projects may be more expensive on a dollar-per-kilowatt basis than large reactors are. However, he said lessons from these initial deployments could lead to lower costs in future SMR projects.\nMeanwhile, in September, Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation Energy to revive Unit 1 at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island plant, the site, in 1979, of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The reactor in question wasn\u2019t the one involved in the partial meltdown, but rather one that had been shuttered in 2019 because it was too expensive to operate.\nConstellation says the reactor, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, will return to service a few years from now. Microsoft won\u2019t directly draw on Crane\u2019s output, but will instead use it to \u201cmatch\u201d its energy needs elsewhere and therefore avoid additional fossil-fuel plants having to be built, says Hollis.\nElsewhere in Pennsylvania, Amazon is also trying to tap into an existing nuclear plant, the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, by using the energy the facility produces to power an adjacent data center. However, the company\u2019s plans to expand the data center hit a major snag in November. Regulators sided with complaints from utilities, which buy electricity from the plant\u2019s owner, that the Amazon deal would increase prices for regular power users and threaten the grid\u2019s reliability.\nAmazon insists that\u2014even after claiming as much as 960 megawatts of power from Susquehanna, as it would like to\u2014there would be enough left over to satisfy local demand. While the deal doesn\u2019t introduce new power to the grid, Amazon says it should provide enough stable revenue to the plant\u2019s operator to keep the facility active for the foreseeable future.\nFinancially, most of the tech companies are taking on little risk with their nuclear alliances. The so-called power purchase agreements they\u2019ve signed give some financial security to the power-generation projects without placing any risk on themselves if the projects fail to pan out.\nPublic Citizen\u2019s Slocum says the reluctance of tech companies to provide upfront funding for nuclear development suggests \u201cthere is still hesitation about risk uncertainty with the nuclear build-out.\u201d\nAmazon is the exception by leading the big investment in X-energy, which Amazon data center chief Kevin Miller says is the right way to \u201chelp companies develop their climate solutions faster.\u201d\nIn the case of the former Three Mile Island, Constellation has reportedly applied for a federal loan guarantee that would cover the $1.6 billion cost of restarting the reactor. Some have argued that this shifts much of the risk onto taxpayers, though Constellation says it just enables lower-interest-rate financing, and insists the company would repay such a loan itself.\nThere are also concerns about the length of time it will take for any new nuclear power to come online. The demand for more energy is immediate, but none of the production related to the recent deals with Big Tech will be completed for at least a few years. The focus instead, nuclear critics say, should be on renewables like wind and solar, which are widely proven to work. Also, renewables could soon provide reliable 24/7 power, thanks to advances in energy storage like batteries and gradual improvements in connecting clean power projects to the broader electrical grid.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Hollis reckons renewables could plausibly satisfy Big Tech\u2019s energy cravings, once the connection and storage pieces of the puzzle are in place. But certainly for the next couple of decades, says Hollis, \u201cnuclear will have a role to play.\u201d\nGoing nuclear\nTech giants are racing to sign deals for nuclear energy to power their growing ambitions in AI.\nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft and Constellation Energy plan to restart the decommissioned Unit 1 at Pennsylvania's Crane Clean Energy Center, formerly Three Mile Island, by 2028.\nGoogle\nGoogle has signed an agreement with California reactor developer Kairos Power to buy energy from six or seven SMRs, to be completed from 2030 through 2035.\nAmazon\nAmazon has invested in SMR developer X-energy and utilityconsortium Energy Northwest, with a go-live target of the early 2030s. It\u2019s also exploring an SMR project in Virginia with Dominion Energy, and bought a data center collocated with the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.\nOracle\nOracle intends to soon build a large data center powered by three SMRs, chairman Larry Ellison announced in September.\nThis article appears in the December 2024/January 2025 issue of Fortune with the headline \"Why big tech is the nuclear industry's new best friend.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves right now.\nWith Donald Trump having won the elections, it seems Elon Musk is going to be a powerful force in the administration.\u00a0 After all, X CEO has played an outsized role in his comeback, contributing millions to his campaign, serving as policy advisor, and even using his social media platform as a Make America Great Again (MAGA) advocacy platform.\nNow that his efforts have come to fruition Max Tegmark, a leading scientist, who has previously worked with the world\u2019s richest person says Musk\u2019s influence could lead to tougher safety standards for artificial intelligence, as reported by The Guardian.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Stories Shaking Up Wall Street\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nTegmark says Musk\u2019s backing of a failed AI bill demonstrated that Musk is still worried about the repercussions of uncontrolled AI development. The SB 1047 bill in California required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them.\nHaving frequently warned that such an unrestrained development can be catastrophic for humanity, Musk was one of the 30,000 others who had signed a letter calling for a pause on the development of advanced AI technology last year.\nAccording to Tegmark, Musk could convince Trump to introduce standards that prevent the growth of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a term used for AI systems that match or surpass human levels of intelligence.\n\u201cI do think that if Elon manages to get Trump\u2019s ear on AI issues we\u2019re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI. He might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.\u201d\nBefore Trump won the elections, Musk had predicted the development of artificial intelligence that would be smarter than the smartest human being by next year or by 2026.\n\"If you define AGI (artificial general intelligence) as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably next year, within two years\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) to $375 from $325 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The analyst, rating the stock as part of a broader research note previewing Q3 results for the Infrastructure & Security Software names, notes that buyer behavior has been stabilizing and the firm is focused on visibility into 2025 when generative AI projects will have a \u201crubber meets the road\u201d moment. In particular, the firm believes that Crowdstrike\u2019s recent challenges, especially its global IT outage on July 19th, may lead to lower upsell revenue. There may also be a greater-than-normal decrease in business/ revenue due to longer-than-usual subscription durations following its global IT outage.\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves right now. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This caused significant reputational damage to the cybersecurity leader, as the outage led to grounded flights, canceled medical procedures and widespread disruption. Following this incident, the stock took a sharp dive, dropping from $345 to $264 on July 22, as investors reacted to the news.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRWD.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nThe repercussions from the July 19 outage was revealed when the company reported its Q2 FY25 earnings. Despite the outage, the company managed to outperform wall-street analysts' revenue and earnings expectations, leading to a 3% stock price increase following the earnings release. However, with its Q2 FY25 earnings results, management released its lowered top-line and bottom-line guidance for the upcoming quarters. Despite this lowered guidance, the stock largely rebounded, and is now in line with the S&P 500's YTD returns. My long-term investment perspective for CrowdStrike lies on one key trend in cybersecurity: the growing demand from enterprise customers to consolidate multiple-vendor solutions onto a single platform to cut costs. Consequently, the recent macroeconomic pressures have forced enterprise customers to focus on efficiency and find ways to do more with less. Thus, this key trend remains strong and I believe CrowdStrike is well-positioned to benefit, as it provides one of the top platforms in the market at significant cost-savings.\nThe Falcon Platform: One-Stop Shop\nCrowdStrike is basically known as an endpoint protection company in the cybersecurity market, but I don't think this fully captures the scope of services that the company currently offers. In reality, it operates as a one-stop platform for enterprise cybersecurity solutions, which was a key point highlighted during its Q2 FY25 earnings presentation. While there are many competitors in the industry, no other competitor is able to offer the scope of services that CrowdStrike does. Thus, as mentioned previously, I believe that CrowdStrike is positioned well to benefit in a time where enterprises are increasingly looking to consolidate its cybersecurity infrastructure. As a result, CrowdStrike's platform is able to serve as a consolidated solution, which is difficult to compete with in the current cybersecurity landscape.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nGeorge Kurtz (CEO of CrowdStrike) pointed out that enterprise customers are focused on efficiency and reducing complexity, noting that Customers don't want to go backwards and have a patchwork of products. They are still focused on the consolidation piece and they're looking at us as one of the key consolidators in the market\". What was actually meant by this statement is evident in the fact that about 65% of the company's customers use five or more modules, 45% use six or more and 30% use seven or modules. Furthermore, among larger customers that spend over $100,000 annually on CrowdStrike's services, nearly half use eight or more modules. This highlights the depth of the consolidation in CrowdStrike's cybersecurity customer portfolio, making it significantly challenging to compete with.\nFurther, I found a research piece from Gartner that noted that 75% of enterprise customers are actively looking to decrease the number of cybersecurity vendors that they work with, further supporting the industry trend of vendor consolidation. Thus, the primary goal for enterprise customers is to increase integration and lower vendor management costs, and this shift will likely result in a handful of dominant players emerging in the market. Given CrowdStrike's early focus on consolidation through its Falcon platform, it is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.\nPost-Outage Recovery\nPost the outage on July 19, CrowdStrike experienced some disruption in its sales pipeline with a few deals placed on hold, and to be finalized in subsequent quarters. Consequently, management clarified to investors that the larger part of those delayed deals would still stay in the pipeline. That said, investors should be prepared to hear that some of the new customers are going to be more cautious than usual, since the company has lost some trust within the marketplace as a result of the outage. During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, CFO Burt Podbere noted the following: \"We expect to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, with additional scrutiny requiring higher levels of approval at the CEO and, in some cases, Board of Directors level.\" The meaning behind this is simple: the longer the list of approvals, the more protracted the sales cycle will be, especially in large corporations. Although the CFO didn't mention the exact delay periods, I expect bigger deals to take close to six months to finalize.\nTo address the situation, it appears that CrowdStrike has introduced customer commitment packages, wherein the company gives a discount and other incentives to their customers in return for signing longer-term contracts. This may, however, affect the company's revenues for the next few quarters, but it's important to note that CrowdStrike still managed to win several eight and nine-figure deals despite the outage. For example, within cloud security, CrowdStrike secured an eight-figure deal with a major enterprise software firm, which opted to standardize on Falcon Cloud Security across its entire business, replacing another next-gen cloud security vendor. Similarly, a nine-figure cloud security deal saw a large enterprise adopt Falcon Cloud Security across a million hosts, replacing other cloud security products.\nIn the Security information and event management (SIEM) market, CrowdStrike continues to outperform legacy SIEM providers. Two major deals stand out: an eight-figure deal with an existing customer, which replaced two legacy SIEMs with CrowdStrike's LogScale, resulting in over 60% cost savings, and a seven-figure deal with a leading generative AI company, which standardized on LogScale after a year of use, improving search speed, response times, and total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to their previous legacy SIEM solution.\nExpanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)\nCrowdStrike's growth story is further supported by the expanding TAM. In 2024, the TAM for cybersecurity is expected to be around $100 billion, but this figure is projected to grow to $225 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8%. Even if CrowdStrike only manages to grow in line with the market, the company has a long runway for growth. Given its platformization strategy, I believe CrowdStrike is positioned to outpace market growth and capture significant market share.\nStrong Results Despite Challenges\nCrowdStrike's Q2 FY25 results, in my view, basically showcase the company's resilience and strength, even in the face of significant adversity (with the recent outage and macro pressures). The company reported revenue of $964 million (up 31.7% YoY), overperforming wall-street guidance by $5.5 million. With 94% of its revenue coming from subscriptions, the growth in this segment is a key indicator of CrowdStrike's performance. Subscription revenue grew 33% YoY, while ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) was up 32%, reaching $3.9 billion. This included $218 million in net new ARR, an 11% increase YoY, in line with the company's guidance.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nCrowdStrike also reported record non-GAAP operating income of $227 million, representing a 46% YoY increase, signaling excellent operational efficiency. Notably, non-GAAP operating income is growing faster than revenue, demonstrating the company's operating leverage, a key strength in the tech sector, where many companies prioritize growth over profitability.\nRobust Cash Flow Generation\nFree cash flows increased by 44% YoY to $272 million in Q2 FY25, with a 28% free cash flow margin, highlighting the company's ability to fund its own growth. The company achieved what it calls the \"rule of 60\" during the quarter. This means that the sum of its YoY revenue growth rate (approximately 32%) and its free cash flow margin (28%) equals 60. The term is derived from the \"rule of 40,\" a concept introduced by Brad Feld, who describes it as the idea that a company's growth rate combined with its profitability should total at least 40%. For example, a 20% growth rate should correspond with a 20% profit margin, while a 50% growth rate could be paired with a 10% loss. Exceeding this benchmark is rare, which is why investors tend to value CrowdStrike more highly compared to other growth stocks.\nLowered Management Guidance\nAlthough the company reported great Q2 FY25 results despite the outage, the repercussions of the outage is largely reflected in CrowdStrike's full-year guidance. Management lowered its initial revenue guidance for FY25 by 1.5%, now expecting revenue to be between $3.896 billion and $3.989 billion, down from the original forecast of $3.924 billion to $3.989 billion. Non-GAAP operating income guidance was also reduced by 11.23%, with the new midpoint at $788.5 million, down from $888.3 million. While Q3 FY25 is expected to show continued revenue growth of 34.2%, non-GAAP operating income growth is forecasted to slow to 8.3%, reflecting the near-term impact of the outage on profitability.\nCapacity For Continued Investments\nI have already mentioned Crowdstrike's ability to drive impressive revenue growth and operational efficiency. But, in addition to this, the reason that I'm bullish on the company is mainly due to the fact that CrowdStrike's fundamental strengths are also backed by its commitment to reinvest back into the core business. Looking at the closest rival to CrowdStrike (Palo Alto Networks), CrowdStrike's Capex to CFO ratio is relatively higher. Although Palo Alto Networks has larger R&D capex spending in absolute terms, if CRWD sustains its impressive CFO growth, it will likely close the gap with PANW soon. CrowdStrike's top-line and CFO is growing much faster compared to rivals.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nStrong Balance Sheet\nCrowdStrike also maintains a solid balance sheet. As of Q2 FY25, the company held $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents against $743.2 million in long-term debt, giving it a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of 0.28. Furthermore, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.75 suggests that CrowdStrike can comfortably manage its debt using operating profits. Furthermore, while some competitors and investors overhyped the potential for CrowdStrike to lose business, the company's operating leverage remains on track. With its continued focus on platform consolidation, I expect CrowdStrike to maintain its leadership position and recover from the recent setbacks caused by the outage.\nValuation Thoughts\nFrom a valuation standpoint, I am quite optimistic about CrowdStrike's potential. I believe CrowdStrike is currently trading at a significant discount, especially when considering the several growth catalysts that will unfold in both the short and long term. At the moment, CrowdStrike is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23x, which is well below its five-year historical average of 29x. This disparity may suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its historical valuation, presenting a unique buying opportunity for investors. In the near term, I anticipate that CrowdStrike's stock may experience some additional drawdowns as investors reassess their positions in light of the recent outage. However, I view this as a temporary phase, which could provide a compelling entry point for those who may have missed out on the stock during its earlier growth stages.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nHistorically, CrowdStrike's P/S ratio has been considerably higher, so I expect that as the company fully recovers from the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) incident, its valuation will revert closer to the five-year average of 29x. Given these factors, I'm setting a target multiple of 27x, which would imply a price target of around $375 per share. This represents an upside of approximately 20%, which, in my opinion, provides a solid margin for investors to take advantage of at current levels.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[Alpha Spread]\nFrom a discounted cash flow (DCF) perspective, I used a discount rate of 8% (which reflects the company's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC) and applied a conservative terminal growth rate of 5%. This DCF analysis aligns with Wall Street's growth forecasts for CrowdStrike over the next five years, which reflects a topline-growth rate of 15% over the next five years and some operating leverage improvements as the company expands beyond endpoint protection and solidifies its position as a leader in platform consolidation, offering a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity services. The scalability and robustness of the Falcon platform have already been proven, supporting the optimistic outlook from analysts. Based on this DCF model, I derive an upside of roughly 19% (with a target price of $408), which I believe offers ample margin for value investors seeking to capitalize on CrowdStrike's current valuation. Given the company's strong fundamentals, its recovery potential, and the broader market opportunity, I see this as an attractive entry point for those looking to invest at these levels.\nConclusion\nDespite the recent outage and its immediate challenges, I remain confident in CrowdStrike's long-term growth potential. The company's current market position, and the strategy towards platform consolidation positions it well to capitalize on the growing trend of enterprise customers seeking to streamline their cybersecurity solutions with a single provider to save costs and improve efficiency. Even after the setback (with regards to BSOD), CrowdStrike secured significant deals, demonstrating resilience and maintaining market trust. Additionally, with its current valuation appearing attractive compared to historical averages, a robust balance sheet, and a proven ability to drive growth through its Falcon platform, I see this as a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on its recovery and long-term market potential.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 6.7% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nStory Continues\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs CRWD a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.65.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.

This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 30.95 of its industry.\nWe can also see that CRWD currently has a PEG ratio of 3.28. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Internet - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.45 as of yesterday's close.\nStory Continues\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

That's why a stock split, which multiplies the number of shares an investor owns or that an investor can buy, always makes big news. Hot tech stocks are prone to splitting when their share price gets excessively high and there is speculation these three tech stocks could be primed for a split.\nDon't Miss:\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nCrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD)\nIf you've ever surfed the web, you have likely used a website that uses CrowdStrike to keep the site secure. Since its IPO in 2019, CrowdStrike has established itself as one of the world's most recognizable cloud-based cybersecurity companies. Back then, its shares traded for only $34, but today, a share in CrowdStrike will set you back a hefty $336.\nCrowdStrike occupies a large market share, largely because it's one of the few cybersecurity companies that provide its services via cloud apps instead of directly installing applications like DVDs. This approach allows Crowdstrike's biggest clients, many of which are tech companies or have extensive Web-based operations, to keep the same service as their operations expand.\nCrowdstrike's reputation hit in the summer when it experienced a global outage that knocked some of the world's biggest tech companies offline. Despite that, the company's public filings show that CrowdStrike became profitable in 2024. More importantly, analysts expect this stock's earnings per share (EPS) to grow by over 70% by 2027. If CrowdStrike hits those targets, this stock price may shoot so high that a split becomes a strong possibility.\nTrending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% \u2014 Investors like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nMongoDB (Nasdaq: MDB)\nMongoDB manufactures database management software that allows companies more options for upscaling or customization.

Another bonus for ASML shareholders is that it pays a dividend of 0.098% ($6.45/share).\nConsidering this stock's previous history of splitting and its current sky-high share price, it's not hard to imagine ASML getting set for another split at some point in the future. In the meantime, analysts at JP Morgan and Wells Fargo have given ASML a \"buy now\" rating. The buy-in isn't cheap, but the prospect of earning a dividend and a future stock split makes ASML worth some attention from tech investors.\nDiversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nWhile Realty Income is undoubtedly a solid choice for investors seeking consistent monthly dividend income, it's important to remember that publicly traded stocks are subject to market volatility. For those looking to diversify their income streams and potentially reduce exposure to market fluctuations, real estate investing through platforms like Arrived is worth considering.\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio.\nThis article Investor Alert-Could These Three Hot Tech Stocks Be About To Split originally appeared on Benzinga.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 26% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE.\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CrowdStrike Holdings is:\n6.0% = US$175m \u00f7 US$2.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nCrowdStrike Holdings' Earnings Growth And 6.0% ROE\nOn the face of it, CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that CrowdStrike Holdings grew its net income at a significant rate of 28% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\nWe then compared CrowdStrike Holdings' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period.\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Past Earnings Growth November 18th 2024\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is CRWD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\nStory Continues\nIs CrowdStrike Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nGiven that CrowdStrike Holdings doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we do feel that CrowdStrike Holdings has some positive attributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for CrowdStrike Holdings, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.012 = US$53m \u00f7 (US$7.2b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).\nThus, CrowdStrike Holdings has an ROCE of 1.2%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 9.0%.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024\nIn the above chart we have measured CrowdStrike Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CrowdStrike Holdings for free.\nWhat Can We Tell From CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE Trend?\nThe fact that CrowdStrike Holdings is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 1.2% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 439% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.\nOur Take On CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE\nIn summary, it's great to see that CrowdStrike Holdings has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CrowdStrike Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\nOne more thing, we've spotted 2 warning signs facing CrowdStrike Holdings that you might find interesting.\nStory Continues\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD has staged an impressive comeback, with shares rallying 34% over the past three months. This surge follows the significant dip in its share price triggered by the global IT outage on July 19, 2024.\nCRWD stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry and the S&P 500 index\u2019s rise of 16.2% and 10%, respectively, in the past three months. It has also fared better than other cybersecurity players, including Palo Alto Networks PANW, CyberArk Software CYBR and Check Point Software CHKP. Shares of Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk Software have soared 17.1% and 9.1%, respectively, while Check Point Software stock has declined 3.4% during the same time frame.\n3-Month Price Return Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis outperformance has made investors wonder if this is the right time to buy or hold CRWD stock and wait for more stability. Here\u2019s why maintaining a hold strategy could be the most prudent move.\nResilience in CRWD\u2019s Financial Performance Post Outage\nCrowdStrike\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company\u2019s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.\nThe company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm\u2019s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.\nThis robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike\u2019s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company\u2019s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation\nCrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.\nThe Falcon platform\u2019s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike\u2019s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Market Position and Customer Loyalty\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm\u2019s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.\nMoreover, the company's \u201cFalcon Flex\u201d subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.\nNavigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike\nDespite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company\u2019s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management\u2019s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.\nAnalysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPotential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike\u2019s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern\nCrowdStrike\u2019s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry\u2019s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now\nWhile CrowdStrike\u2019s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These totals would mark changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, from last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.13% lower. Currently, CrowdStrike Holdings is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note CrowdStrike Holdings's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 93.93. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 32.89.\nWe can additionally observe that CRWD currently boasts a PEG ratio of 3.33. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.52.\nStory Continues\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 52, putting it in the top 21% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.\nData Breaches to Disruptions\nThe technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\u2014a 300% increase from 2015 levels.\nA Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.\nAI Meets Cybercrime\nAs AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.\nAI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. \u201cCyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,\u201d noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.\nNonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 \u201cwill be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,\u201d yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively\u2014closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.\nStory Continues\nThe constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nYear-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nEarlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike\u2019s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn\u2019t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon\u2019s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.\nClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.\u201d\nOverall, CRWD ranks 6th on our list of\u00a0 best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC). These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nBroadcom\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors\u00a0industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company\u2019s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.\nHowever, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom\u2019s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\nMerck\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\nYet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\nShares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.\nAggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.\nHowever, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space. The company formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions.\nStory Continues\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)\nShares of Natural Health Trends have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+1.8% vs. +21.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, a declining active member base remains the biggest concern for the company. It faces liquidity challenges and high operating expenses. Dependency on key markets and intense competition pose additional risks.\nHowever, expansion into new markets and improvement in cost management bode well.\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Natural Health Trends here >>>)\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shopify Inc.

High competition from other players is an overhang.\nMarsh & McLennan (MMC) Strategic Buyouts Aid, Expenses High\nPer the Zacks analyst, multiple acquisitions help Marsh & McLennan expand geographically, and diversify its portfolio. However, escalating expenses continue to trim margins.\nIncrease in New Insurance Written Aid MGIC Investment (MTG)\nPer the Zacks analyst, MGIC Investment is set to grow on higher insurance in force and annual persistency, lower claims and a strong capital position. Yet, rising expenses weigh on margin expansion.\nPre-Salt Reserves Help Petrobras (PBR), Debt Mountain Hurts\nThe Zacks analyst believes Petrobras' stakes in Brazil's lucrative pre-salt oil reservoirs should improve its earnings outlook, but is concerned about the company's massive $44,251 million debt load.\nCustomer Growth, Investment Aid Pinnacle West Capital (PNW)\nPer the Zacks analyst, Pinnacle West is gaining from customer additions, which is creating demand. Investment in infrastructure and energy generation is aiding it to serve customers efficiently.\nQuanta (PWR) Benefits From Strong Demand Amid Labor Woes\nPer the Zacks analyst, Quanta is benefiting from robust demand for its services and accretive acquisitions. However, labor and supply chain woes are major concerns.\nOngoing Menu Expansion Aids QIAGEN (QGEN), Macro Woes Stay\nPer the Zacks analyst, QIAGEN's robust R&D spending to expand the testing menu across key platforms is encouraging. Yet, macroeconomic volatilities, including the challenges in China, raise concerns.\nNew Upgrades\nCorcept (CORT) Rides on Robust Korlym Sales Performance\nPer the Zacks analyst, Corcept's sole drug, Korlym, approved for treating Cushing's syndrome, is driving the top-line. The company is also making good progress with its promising pipeline candidates.\nFocus on Cost Savings to Bolster McCormick's (MKC) Margins\nPer the Zacks analyst, McCormick's focus on cost-saving plans will continue to enhance its margins. The company expects its fiscal 2024 gross margin to increase by 50 to 100 basis points.\nProduct Rollouts & Growing Merchant Base Aid Shopify (SHOP)\nPer the Zacks analyst, Shopify is benefiting from expanding merchant base driven by applications like Shopify Bill Pay, Tax platform, Collective and Marketplace Connect solutions.\nNew Downgrades\nDecline in Vehicle Production, Rising Debt Ail Magna (MGA)\nPer the Zacks analyst, lower-than-anticipated vehicle production in North America and Europe is likely to hurt Magna's top-line growth. Rising debt levels are also concerning.\nHigh Costs, Falling Revenues Hurt Affiliated Managers (AMG)\nPer the Zacks analyst, weak top-line performance, and elevated costs are major near-term headwinds for Affiliated Managers. The presence of substantial intangible assets on its balance sheet is a woe.\nSpectrum Brands (SPB) Struggles With Numerous Headwinds\nPer the Zacks analyst, Spectrum Brands has been witnessing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty for a while.

An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them. The hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.\nAnd while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.\nAnalysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) in the last month.\nHere are the major companies that have become popular shorts.\nPopular short stocks\nS3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.\nStory continues\nChipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.\nThe demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.\nAt the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.\nShares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.\nAnd Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.\nRead more: Rise in UK borrowing shows Reeves has 'little wiggle room' on spending\nThe discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.\nTesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.\nHowever, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve \"slight growth\" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.\nS3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).\nFollowing its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.\nS&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this \"may be related to the [US] election\".\nThey said that despite this significant activity in \"all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses\".\nGlobal short bets\nMeanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.\nThe data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on \"crowdedness\", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors\u2019 supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.\nLVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.\nThe company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an \"uncertain economic and geopolitical environment\" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.\nRead more: FTSE 100 and European-listed stocks to own in 2025, according to Barclays\nThe luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\nKering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.\nShares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.\nMultinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.\nDiageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIt has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.\nIn South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.\nRead more: What we know about planned UK private stock market Pisces\nHindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were \"nothing but a lie\".\nOn Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.\nShares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.\nIn a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were \"baseless\".\nHindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.\nHowever, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024\nHow Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.\nOf course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\nStory Continues\nBroadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.\nOur View\nWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers\u2014critical components for Nvidia\u2019s AI-focused operations.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nA strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.\nHistorically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s during major market reactions. Nvidia\u2019s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.\nHow To Buy AVGO Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\nStory Continues\nCheck It Out:\nArrived Achieved A Total Return of 34.7% On Their Biggest Sale Yet \u2014 Diversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure.\nOnce the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months.\nNvidia (NVDA) earnings \u2014 coming after the bell Wednesday \u2014 will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday.\n\"It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,\" said Essaye. \"It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.\"\nNvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock \u2014 up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years \u2014 hit record highs following the election.\nBut many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.\nSemiconductor returns during the second half of 2024\nThe worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.\nMeanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) \u2014 seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor \u2014 is down 14%.\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months.

Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia \u2014 \"priced to perfection\" according to many analysts \u2014 underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.\nStory Continues\nBut Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this \"bellwether\" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.\n\"They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far,\" he said. \"I think they can do it again.\"\nmorning brief image\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there\u2019s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University\u2019s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).\nFounded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university\u2019s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard\u2019s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard\u2019s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university\u2019s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard\u2019s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.\nAccording to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. \u201cNarv\u201d Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia\u2019s 11.5% or Brown\u2019s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC\u2019s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:\n\u201cIn FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC\u2019s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.\u201d\nNotably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from \"overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500.\" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar\u2019s strategy of overhauling the university\u2019s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Harvard Management Company\u2019s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company\u2019s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing \u201cseasonal headwinds\u201d linked to a product transition for Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's \"easy\" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some \"serious gains.\"\n\"I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It\u2019s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don\u2019t count. But that, people, is nonsense.\"\nCramer said banks do not \"care\" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.\n\"I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I\u2019m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.\"\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks.\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nCommenting about Broadcom in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said:\n\u201cI am also pulling for Broadcom. I think Broadcom should do well. I don\u2019t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.\u201d\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market.\u00a0Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe continued to build our position in\u00a0Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "Broadcom: 3 Reasons We Love This Stock\nBroadcom currently trades at $165.14 and has been a dream stock for shareholders. It\u2019s returned 431% since November 2019, blowing past the S&P 500\u2019s 87.9% gain. The company has also beaten the index over the past six months as its stock price is up 16.8%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy AVGO? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is AVGO a Good Business?\nOriginally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.\n1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Over the last five years, Broadcom grew its sales at an excellent 16% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).\nBroadcom Quarterly Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nBroadcom\u2019s management team is currently guiding for a 50.6% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect Broadcom\u2019s revenue to grow 24.6% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus its 21.6% annualized growth rate for the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and implies its newer products and services will catalyze higher growth rates.\n3. Excellent Free Cash Flow Boosts Reinvestment Potential\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nBroadcom has shown terrific cash profitability, and if sustainable, puts it in an advantageous position to invest in new products, return capital to investors, and consolidate the market during industry downturns. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the semiconductor sector, averaging an eye-popping 43.8% over the last two years.\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we think Broadcom is a great business, and with its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 28.2x forward price-to-earnings (or $165.14 per share). Is now a good time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than Broadcom\nThe elections are now behind us. With rates dropping and inflation cooling, many analysts expect a breakout market to cap off the year - and we\u2019re zeroing in on the stocks that could benefit immensely.\nTake advantage of the rebound by checking out our Top 9 Market-Beating Stocks. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like Comfort Systems (+783% five-year return).

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 points to a change of +14% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nData is at the forefront of many inventions today and is the primary ingredient of innovation. Of the many branches of data usage, predictive analytics is garnering immense traction, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistics, modeling, and machine learning to forecast, predict, and plan future events. There are different types of predictive analytics including regression analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics market was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023. The global predictive analytics market is expected to grow to $95.3 billion by 2032 from $18.02 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%. The report attributes the growth in the industry to the growing investments in data by the government and large corporations followed by IoT and AI integrations. The use of predictive analytics is bifurcated into multiple segments including life sciences, automotive, retail, energy, telecom, and healthcare, to name a few.\nStartups Disrupting the Predictive Analytics Space\nThere are a range of startups in the predictive analytics space that are revolutionizing the industry. One such name is Pecan AI. The automated predictive analytics platform is developed and designed intricately to meet the needs of data scientists. Data scientists can use the platform to build powerful predictive AI capabilities and machine learning models that drive business impact. Data scientists do not need coding or data science skills to make use of the platform. The platform is used by a range of companies including Johnson & Johnson, SciPlay, Hydrant, Kenvue, Proper Cloth, and DME Acquire. Earlier in January, the company introduced predictive generative AI to transform enterprises. Pecan AI also has partnerships with some of the largest tech corporations and platforms including Azure and AWS.\nDataRobot is another leader in the predictive analytics industry that delivers revolutionary AI use cases for businesses. Its AI platform consists of core AI features such as generative AI, predictive AI, AI governance, AI observability, and AI foundation. The platform promises 83% faster deployment and secures nearly 1.4 billion predictions every day. Users can run models in minutes by skipping manual data preparation and cleaning. Additionally, the platform eliminates the need for repetitive coding, by streamlining feature discovery and defining elements of datasets automatically. Users can connect data from warehouses such as AWS and Azure into a singular workspace. Some of the predictive use cases facilitated by DataRobot include time series modeling, clustering and seasonality, cold start forecasting, nowcasting, and anomaly detection.\nStory Continues\nNow that we have studied the predictive analytics industry and some revolutionary startups, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now we went through multiple reports on the internet, ETFs, and stock screeners. We then examined the analyst upside of each stock and ranked the ones with the highest percentage. Our list is in ascending order of the analyst upside as of November 11, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Predictive Analytics Stock to Invest in Now?\nA data analyst working at a computer, crunching numbers for the company's 80% total assets.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nAnalyst upside as of November 11, 2024: 12%\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) offers predictive analytics through its Automation Analytics and Intelligence platform. The platform offers workload automation solutions supported by a predictive analytics workload platform allowing entities to visualize data and manage complex workloads that facilitate the development of crucial business insights.\nSome key features of the platform by Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) include cross-platform visibility, dynamic service level management, enhanced workload analytics, business monitoring, enhanced change control, and dynamic critical path discovery. All these features combined put AVGO ahead of its competitors.\nOverall, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a rapidly growing company with expertise in ASICs, infrastructure software, and data analytics, contributing to its ranking on our list. Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their median price target of $200 implies an upside of 12%, as of November 11.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cWe continued to build our position in\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 8th on our list of best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain.\nWhile the stock has fallen 10% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.5% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 39% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 140.31.\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Earnings Per Share Growth November 16th 2024\nDive deeper into Broadcom's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Broadcom's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWhat About Dividends?\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Broadcom's TSR for the last 5 years was 507%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nA Different Perspective\nWe're pleased to report that Broadcom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 71% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 43%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:\n14% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\nTo start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.\nNYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nCramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:\n\u201cLet's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive\u2026 Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market\u2026 Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting\u2026 Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again\u2026 Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company\u2019s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.\nOverall NOW ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing \u201csovereign\u201d artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to \u201ccodify\u201d a country\u2019s culture, history, and collective intelligence.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News You Must Read Today.\nThat said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.\u201d\nWhile AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.\nLatest Advancements in AI\nIn recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification\u201d.\nStory Continues\nOther fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.\nIn other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed \u201cOperator\u201d, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human\u2019s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia\u2019s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.\nThis partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.\nFor the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%.

Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock\u2019s ongoing upward momentum.\nAbout the Company\nToast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.\nWith its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.\nIts platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.\nToast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of \u201cA\u201d in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a \u201cF\u201d in Value.\nQ3 Earnings Beat\nOn November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.\nQ3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.\nThe company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.\nGross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.\nManagement comments were overwhelmingly bullish:\n\u201cToast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.\u201d\nEstimates Headed Higher\nAnalysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.\nStory Continues\nFor the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.\nFor the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.\nFor the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.\nToast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote\nWith the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.\nJPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.\nThe Technical Take\nThe stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO\u2019d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.\nAfter trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.\nWith the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.\nPost earnings low: $36\nGap fill: $33\n21-day: $32\n50-day: $29.20\n200-day: $25.20\nFibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32\nWhile that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.\nIn Summary\nToast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.\nThe company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.\nAs Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.\nBear of the Day:\nClean Harbors \u00a0is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.\nThe company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?\nWith an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.\nAbout the Company\nClean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).\nThe company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world\u2019s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.\nCLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cD\u201d in Value, But \u201cB\u201d in both Momentum and Growth.\nQ3 Earnings\nThe company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.\nDespite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.\nPositive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.\nWhile there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.\nEarnings Estimates\nEstimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.\nFor the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.\nLooking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.\nFor the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year\u2019s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.\nTechnical Take\nThe drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.\nThis volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.\nThe drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.\nThe stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.\nIn Summary\nClean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.\nWith significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.\nAdditional content:\nServiceNow Expands Generative AI Offerings: Is the Stock a Buy?\nServiceNow\u00a0is adding Generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to the Now platform to foster responsible AI.

The free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, subscription revenues are projected between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 21.5-22% on a GAAP basis. At cc, subscription revenues are expected to grow at 20.5%.\nCurrent Remaining Performance Obligation is expected to grow 21.5% year over year on both non-GAAP and GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% for the current quarter.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $13.87 per share, up 0.4% over the past 30 days, indicating a 28.66% year-over-year increase.\nServiceNow, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ServiceNow, Inc. Quote\nThe consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.\nStrong Portfolio Aids NOW\u2019s Prospects\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.\nServiceNow\u2019s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.\nThe Xanadu update adds the latest AI capabilities to boost customer agility, enhance productivity and improve employee experiences.

It is expected to reduce the time to resolve an issue and make live agents more productive.\nStrong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive\nA strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nNOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.\nThe strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.\nIn third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.\nNOW\u2019s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation\nHowever, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector\u2019s 6.37X.\nWe believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow\u2019s premium valuation.\nConclusion\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.\nServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc.

          "whole_article": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in NOW?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.\nInsiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nNYSE:NOW Insider Trading Volume November 14th 2024\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of ServiceNow\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?\nInsiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nMarket Capitalization: $215.95 billion\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps digitize and unify organizations so that they can find smarter, faster, better ways to make work flow.\nOn November 12, Wells Fargo raised the firm\u2019s price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $1,150 from $1,050 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares. According to the firm, ServiceNow is among the few companies that are demonstrating tangible AI monetization, i.e. they are really making money from AI. One of the key catalysts that will drive this momentum forward is the launch of its CSM/ITSM agents in Xanadu on November 24. The launch is a major step for the company in enhancing its AI-led customer service offerings. Finally, Wells Fargo expects ServiceNow to take the lead in AI customer service.\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?\u201d\nCramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.\n\u201cTrump wants to cut taxes\u2014all taxes\u2014including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It\u2019s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that\u2019s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.\u201d\nCramer said the market is still \u201coversold\u201d as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

By combining the strengths of ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) and the Five9 platform, the solution will create more streamlined self-service and assisted service operations and unify customer support processes to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and simplify contact center operations.\n\"Organizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together,\" said John Ball, senior vice president, Customer and Industry Workflows at ServiceNow. \"ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self-service and assisted service across voice and digital channels. Our expanded partnership with Five9 takes this even further, combining the best of both platforms to streamline and unify contact center operations with a turnkey solution that\u2019s fast to deploy and delivers fast ROI.\"\n\"Five9\u2019s longstanding partnership with ServiceNow has been rooted in the joint mission to create seamless and powerful end-to-end customer experiences,\" said Callan Schebella, executive vice president, product management, Five9. \"This next phase of our partnership transforms the approach to customer experience management, alleviating a lot of the frustrations that come with using multiple systems to address customer needs. We\u2019ve taken a big step forward to empower customers with our joint AI capabilities and improved interface functionality, easing the day-to-day challenges of customer-facing service.\"\n\"Combining the most valuable features into a unified interface can transform the way we support our customers,\" said Bob Massengill, senior director, Technology Infrastructure, Pilot Travel Centers, LLC. \"This new ServiceNow-Five9 joint solution has the potential to enable us to address customer needs more quickly and effectively.\"\nStory Continues\nThe new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.\nReal-time Transcription \u2013 Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents\u2019 work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.\nUnified Routing \u2013 Five9\u2019s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9. This reduces operational overhead for managers through streamlined routing management across both systems, making it easier to adjust staffing during high-demand periods. It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.\nSingle Agent Experience \u2013 Native Call Controls within ServiceNow\u2019s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer\u2019s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.\nAvailability\nThe ServiceNow and Five9 integrated capabilities are expected to be available to select customers in the first half of 2025.\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is putting AI to work for people.
