(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nTechnology giants in the United States have pledged tens of billions towards building AI data centers in the next few years. These announcements have served to bolster the hype around companies that build data centers. For example, Crusoe Energy, a startup building data centers for large AI firms, plans to raise more than $800 million in funding, per regulatory filings. The filings detail that the company has already raised close to $685 million of the $818 million in total that it is seeking, with seventy investors contributing to the funding. Crusoe is one of many crypto-origin firms that have pivoted to AI in recent months.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nA report by consulting firm McKinsey reveals that global demand for data center capacity could rise at an annual rate of between 19%-22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts. McKinsey analysis suggests that demand for AI-ready data center capacity will rise at an average rate of 33% a year between 2023 and 2030 in a midrange scenario. Per the consulting firm, this means that around 70% of total demand for data center capacity will be for data centers equipped to host advanced-AI workloads by 2030. Gen AI, currently the fastest-growing advanced-AI use case, will account for around 40 percent of the total, the report underlines.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks on the list.\nWith the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least.\nNaturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled \u2018Global Strategy Paper No. 71,\u00a0 the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This \u2018concentration\u2019 refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence.\nSince the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos\u2019 eCommerce company, and the world\u2019s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns.\nAs per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index \u201cby an annualized 200 bp-800 bp\u201d over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today\u2019s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI\u2019s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang\u2019s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade.\nGS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market\u2019s performance of the two indexes before the bubble\u2019s \u2018pop\u2019 to point out that \u201cthe trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).\u201d This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall \u201chas been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.\u201d\nStory Continues\nLinking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this \u201cextreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.\u201d Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then \u201cthis would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.\u201d\nWhile stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk\u2019s car company record stunning gains. Goldman\u2019s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that \u201cthe biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.\u201d He shared that \u201cany sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.\u201d These include \u201cenergy, traditional energy versus renewables\u201d with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%.\nTuteja added that \u201cthe resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election\u201d was a standout from the market\u2019s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that \u201cwhat I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.\u201d This is because \u201cit takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.\u201d According to him, in 2016, \u201cregional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.\u201d Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that \u201cunder the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime\u2019s policies.\u201d\nFor some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now.\nWithin this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024\u2019s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings \u201cgrowth alone can explain 40% of next quarter\u2019s cash spending growth.\u201d\nJust like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the \u201ctypical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.\u201d Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects \u201ccash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,\u201d but cautions that \u201cthe potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 top growth investment stocks, we used the bank\u2019s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm\u2019s cash flow from operations.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA financial analyst in their office, monitoring the daily performance of the stock market.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nGrowth Investment Ratio: 83%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the world\u2019s biggest social media company. Courtesy of its social media network Facebook, the firm can boast about having a whopping 3.2 billion users under its wing. This massive user base is also at the center of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s hypothesis. It makes the firm indispensable to advertisers who have no choice but to run ads on its platform if they want to capture sizable users. The scale has enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to amass significant resources, as evident through its $156 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue and $43.9 billion in cash and equivalent. The firm has used these to create a foothold in the AI industry by developing the Llama foundational AI model. Unlike other big tech players which are gearing their AI products towards cloud computing, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is targeting everyday consumers and advertisers on its platform. The billions it has invested in AI means that investors are on the watch-out for profit generation.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMeta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks 26th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by Meta Platforms Inc., leaving it to face a multibillion-dollar lawsuit that accuses the company of misleading shareholders about the data-harvesting scandal involving political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future\nNYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge\nTrump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy\nNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes\nTokyo\u2019s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\nInvestors claim the company, then known as Facebook, inflated share prices through misleading disclosures about the risk of the scandal leading to the misuse of user data. The shareholders say revelations about the breach eventually contributed to two 2018 price drops that cost the company more than $200 billion in market value.\nMeta was seeking reversal of a federal appeals court decision that had let the lawsuit go forward. The Supreme Court agreed to consider the appeal in June and heard arguments on Nov. 6.\nThe court occasionally drops cases after argument. As is its usual practice, the court provided no explanation, saying only that the case was being \u201cdismissed as improvidently granted.\u201d\nThe dismissal makes it more likely Meta will face a costly settlement \u2014 potentially as large as $2 billion \u2014 according to Matthew Schettenhelm, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. A Meta victory at the Supreme Court would have knocked out some though not all of the case against the company.\n\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,\u201d Meta said in a statement. \u201cWe are disappointed in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to clarify this part of the law.\u201d\nThe attorney for the investors, Kevin Russell, declined to comment.\nThe case more broadly had the potential to reset the legal rules governing corporate disclosure. Business groups led by the Chamber of Commerce had urged the court to side with Meta, saying that risk-disclosure allegations have contributed to a wave of meritless securities-fraud suits.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission since 2005 has required companies to disclose material factors that would make an investment risky.\nThe Supreme Court is also considering an appeal by AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp., which is being sued for allegedly misleading shareholders about its reliance on crypto-mining revenue in the run-up to a market crash.\nStory Continues\nCambridge Analytica\nThe first hint of the Cambridge Analytica controversy came in December 2015, when The Guardian reported that the British firm was using a database of information gleaned from Facebook users to help the presidential primary campaign of Senator Ted Cruz. At the time, Facebook said it was investigating.\nThe suing shareholders say Facebook quickly concluded that Cambridge Analytica had obtained the private information of more than 30 million users without their consent.\nBut the shareholders say the company publicly characterized the risk of a breach as hypothetical and didn\u2019t change that stance until March 2018, when it issued a statement to preempt more far-reaching stories in The New York Times and The Guardian. The investors say those revelations caused the share price to plunge.\nThe shareholders say the company\u2019s inadequate disclosures also contributed to a July 2018 stock plunge that at the time was the largest one-day drop in value in US history.\nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the allegations were sufficient to let the lawsuit go forward.\nMeta said it had no reason to think the scandal would harm the company because details had already been published without any impact on the stock price. Meta said the 9th Circuit\u2019s reasoning would require companies to disclose risks that occurred years earlier even if they don\u2019t pose any known current threat of business harm.\nThe Biden administration backed the shareholders at the Supreme Court.\nThe case is Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, 23-980.\n(Updates with analyst, Meta reaction starting in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nClear\u2019s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End\nAn Airline\u2019s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nJaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "By John Kruzel\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court sidestepped on Friday a decision on whether to allow shareholders to proceed with a securities fraud lawsuit accusing Meta's Facebook of misleading investors about the misuse of the social media platform's user data.\nThe justices, who heard arguments in the case on Nov. 6, dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court's ruling that allowed a 2018 class action led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed. The Supreme Court opted not to resolve the underlying legal dispute, determining that the case should not have been taken up. Its action leaves the lower court's decision in place.\nThe court's dismissal came in a one-line order that provided no explanation.\nThe Facebook dispute was one of two cases to come before the Supreme Court this month involving the right of private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud. The other one, involving the artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, was argued on Nov. 13. The Supreme Court has not ruled yet in the Nvidia case.\nThe plaintiffs in the Facebook case claimed the company unlawfully withheld information from investors about a 2015 data breach involving British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica that affected more than 30 million Facebook users. They accused Facebook of misleading investors in violation of the Securities Exchange Act, a 1934 federal law that requires publicly traded companies to disclose their business risks.\nFacebook's stock fell following 2018 media reports that Cambridge Analytica had used improperly harvested Facebook user data in connection with Donald Trump's successful U.S. presidential campaign in 2016. The investors have sought unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Facebook stock they held.\nAt issue was whether Facebook broke the law when it failed to detail the prior data breach in subsequent business-risk disclosures, and instead portrayed the risk of such incidents as purely hypothetical.\nFacebook spokesperson Andy Stone expressed disappointment \"in the Supreme Court's decision not to clarify this part of the law.\"\n\"The plaintiff's claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,\" Stone said.\nFacebook argued that it was not required to reveal that its warned-of risk had already materialized because \"a reasonable investor\" would understand risk disclosures to be forward-looking statements.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration supported the shareholders in the case.\nStory Continues\nU.S. District Judge Edward Davila dismissed the lawsuit but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived it, prompting Facebook's appeal to the Supreme Court.\nGeorge Washington University law professor Alan Morrison said that following the Supreme Court's dismissal of Facebook's appeal, the plaintiffs would be expected to seek discovery, a process that involves the exchange of information among parties in a case. Morrison added that Facebook \"might renew their motion to dismiss under a somewhat different standard - partially for purposes of delay.\"\nThe Cambridge Analytica data breach prompted U.S. government investigations into Facebook's privacy practices, various lawsuits and a U.S. congressional hearing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 brought an enforcement action against Facebook over the matter, which the company settled for $100 million. Facebook paid a separate $5 billion penalty to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the issue.\nThe Supreme Court in prior rulings has limited the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that polices securities fraud.\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)\nView Comments"

Most of these startups are software companies working on expanding AI use cases. In the midst of this AI boom, BrightAI, an AI startup that focuses on the physical aspect of the AI business, is now making waves on Wall Street. Founded by Alex Hawkinson, an entrepreneur and investor with a proven track record in the tech world, the company offers an end-to-end tech platform that uses sensors to help companies monitor physical assets.

Since then, the firm has managed to attract seven large enterprise customers across six verticals, including HVAC, waste management, and power. It has deployed more than 250,000 sensors and has reached $80 million in revenue. These figures are impressive since the startup managed to do this without raising any outside capital.

Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected.\nThe report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time.\nNow Nvidia is saying that the chips aren\u2019t just shipping, they\u2019re in the hands of all of the company\u2019s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker\u2019s data center revenue. Ensuring they\u2019re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia\u2019s continued growth.

I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth\u2019s chips makes it difficult to meet demand.\n\u201cIt is the case that demand exceeds supply,\u201d Huang told analysts. \u201cAnd that\u2019s expected as we\u2019re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.\u201d\nCEO Jensen Huang speaks during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nFor some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.\nThe H100 is Nvidia\u2019s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.\nStory Continues\nAs Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need.\n\u201cNvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,\u201d New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. \u201cAnd so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.\u201d\nIn its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth.

And the PMIs don\u2019t fully capture the recent increases in government spending (they focus on private sector activity).\n\u201cEven so, there appears to be more underlying weakness than we had thought. Some of this may be due to the policies announced in the Budget. But since the PMIs in Europe have followed a similar trajectory as in the UK, that\u2019s not the whole story.\n\u201cOur forecasts assume that economic growth improves a bit in Q4 and strengthens further next year, partly due to the rises in government spending announced in the Budget.\n\u201cBut I am now more worried that economic growth will be weaker than our forecasts. And at this stage, it would no longer be a surprise if the economy contracted in Q4.\n\u201cAny recession, though, would presumably be short and small as the drag on the economy from higher interest rates should now be fading.\u201d\n01:59 PM GMT\nRecession warning as Britain reels from Reeves\u2019s Budget\nEconomists have sounded the alarm over a UK recession after data showed Britain\u2019s economy was reeling from the effects of Rachel Reeves\u2019s tax-raising Budget.\nBritain is now \u201cclose to stagnation\u201d after closely watched PMI figures showed activity among the UK\u2019s private sector companies shrank for the first time in more than a year in November.\nSterling dropped to its lowest against the dollar since May and banking stocks plunged on Friday.

Consumer confidence has picked up.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a serious risk of a major recession here but growth has slowed to a crawl.\u201d\n12:35 PM GMT\nBorrowing costs slump amid rate cut bets\nThe cost of government borrowing has fallen amid expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates more sharply next year.\nThe yield on 10-year UK gilts - the return the government promises to buyers of its debt - fell more than five basis points to 4.38pc as traders raced to snap up bonds.\nThe rally in bond markets comes after weak retail sales figures and PMI data sounded the alarm on the health of the UK economy.\nEuropean debt costs were also falling after weak PMI data for the eurozone, potentially pushing central banks to cut interest rates at a faster pace to support growth.\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said the UK PMI figures were \u201cdismal\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cUK bond yields are lower across the curve, although European bond yields are leading the charge.\u201d\n12:00 PM GMT\nRyanair and Easyjet fined over \u00a3100m for \u2018abusive\u2019 baggage fees\nFive budget airlines have been fined \u20ac179m (\u00a3149m) by the Spanish government for \u201cabusive practices\u201d such as charging passengers for hand luggage.\nRyanair has pledged to appeal the \u201cillegal\u201d penalties issued over the Irish carrier\u2019s baggage policies, which it said had been approved in multiple Spanish and EU court hearings.\nIts rival EastJet, Spanish airlines Volotea and Vueling, and Norwegian Air were also fined for charging passengers to reserve adjacent seats for children and other dependents.\nSpain\u2019s consumer rights ministry said the penalties had also been applied for not accepting cash when selling tickets at airports.\nRyanair, which was the first to start charging extra for hand luggage in November 2018, was slapped with the biggest fine of \u20ac107.8m (\u00a389.7m).\nEasyJet was fined \u20ac29.1m (\u00a324.2m).\nRyanair has vowed to appeal the \u2018illegal\u2019 fines placed on the Irish carrier - REUTERS/ Albert Gea\n11:33 AM GMT\nBanks slump amid rising rate cut bets\nUK bank stocks have slumped after Britain\u2019s private sector activity shrank for the first time in a year following the Budget.\nBanks were down 1.6pc across the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 as the weak economic data increased bets on interest rate cuts.\nBarclays was down 3.5pc, Standard Chartered fell 2.8pc, NatWest dropped 2.3pc and Lloyds Banking Group fell 1.9pc.\nHSBC was down 0.9pc as money markets indicate the Bank of England will cut interest rates at least three times next year, sending the pound to its lowest level since May.\n11:08 AM GMT\nFebruary interest rate cut \u2018slam dunk\u2019 as activity shrinks\nThe contraction in Britain\u2019s private sector economy makes an interest rate cut in February a \u201cslam dunk\u201d according to economists.\nMoney markets indicate there is a 89pc chance that the Bank of England will reduce borrowing costs at its first meeting next year, up from a litter under 80pc on Thursday, after business activity slumped for the first time in a year following the Budget.\nElliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cIn isolation, the sharp drop in the headline index of the flash composite PMI for November would substantially raise the probability of the MPC cutting interest rates in December.\n\u201cBut the PMI captures only part of the story. The tax hikes hitting private sector sentiment will be recycled by Chancellor Reeves into stronger government spending which is mostly not measured by the PMI, although government investment plans should support the construction PMI more elevated.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, sticky price pressures signalled by the PMI, signs that the headline survey balance may have overshot in November, now rising CPI inflation, and the risks from election of Mr Trump in the US leaves only a low chance of another rate cut in December.\n\u201cSigns of weaker growth, however, make a February rate cut a slam dunk we think.\n\u201cAccordingly, the market repriced closer to our call after the PMI release, now pricing three rate cuts over the next 12 months. We expect the same, with the MPC cutting in February, May and November.\u201d\n10:38 AM GMT\nPound drops after private sector activity shrinks\nThe value of the pound has dropped sharply after a closely watched survey showed Britain\u2019s private sector activity shrank for the first time in more than a year after the Budget.\nSterling was down as much as 0.9pc against the dollar to less than $1.25 - its lowest level since May - after preliminary PMI data showed business output declined in November.\nIt was the first contraction in activity since October last year and comes after Rachel Reeves raised taxes by \u00a340bn in the Budget, including a \u00a325bn increase in employer National Insurance contributions.\nThe pound was also down 0.1pc against the euro, which is worth 83.3p.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s chief UK economist Sanjay Raja said: \u201cToday\u2019s PMI data were the first real test of the Chancellor\u2019s Budget \u2013 alongside businesses reaction to unfolding geopolitical events.\n\u201cUnderneath the hood, we are seeing stress on hiring plans. Both the manufacturing and services sectors reported falls in hiring plans. And (input) prices \u2013 particularly for services \u2013 have started to firm \u2013 as businesses digest the Budget tax implications.\n\u201cFor policymakers, the key question now will be to assess whether the potential inflationary hit from higher taxes offsets the potential demand hit from weaker private demand. With prices likely to pick up in the first half of 2025, we expect the [Bank of England] to be more cautious than ever, treading a fine line between removing policy restraint too quickly, or indeed, keeping policy too restrictive in the face of heightened uncertainty.\u201d\n10:21 AM GMT\nMore job losses to come following Budget tax raid, say economists\nBosses are growing more concerned about having to make job cuts after a downturn in output since the Budget, economists have said.\nThe closely watched S&P Global Flash UK PMI said both Britain\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors reduced their headcounts in November.\nIt said private sector firms had widely commented about hiring freezes and avoiding replacing voluntary leavers.\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said \u201cthe downturns in output and hiring represent marked contrasts to the robust growth rates seen back in the summer and are accompanied by deepening concern about prospects for the year ahead\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThe November PMI is indicative of the economy slipping into a modest decline, with GDP dropping at a 0.1pc quarterly rate, but the loss of confidence hints at worse to come \u2013 including further job losses \u2013 unless sentiment revives.\u201d\nElias Hilmer, assistant economist at Capital Economics, added: \u201cThe fall in the Composite PMI suggests that tax hikes announced in the Budget seem to have restrained some private sector activity. Equally so, the prospect of new tariffs imposed by the incoming Trump administration may have weighed on activity too.\u201d\n10:01 AM GMT\nBosses cut back on staff as optimism drops\nBritain\u2019s private sector unexpectedly slumped as bosses began to cut back on staff and gave a \u201cthumbs down\u201d to the Budget, PMI data showed.\nThe contraction in output to 49.9 was lower than the expectations of economists, who had pencilled in a reading of 51.8 for the latest S&P Global survey.\nConcerns about the business outlook, as well as stronger input price inflation, \u201cimpacted negatively on workforce numbers in November\u201d, the preliminary PMI data indicated.\nIt said: \u201cSurvey respondents typically commented on subdued customer demand.\n\u201cSome firms noted delayed investment decisions, as well as cutbacks to new projects in response to worsening domestic business conditions and geopolitical uncertainty.\u201d\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: \u201cBusiness optimism has slumped sharply since the General Election, dropping further in November to hit the lowest since late 2022.\n\u201cCompanies are giving a clear \u2018thumbs down\u2019 to the policies announced in the Budget, especially the planned increase in employers\u2019 National Insurance contributions.\u201d\n09:41 AM GMT\nPrivate sector shrinks after Reeves\u2019s tax-raising Budget\nBritain\u2019s private sector suffered a slump in output for the first time in a year after Rachel Reeves\u2019s tax-raising Budget, according to a closely watched survey.\nThe S&P Global Flash UK PMI - a gauge of activity in the UK economy - has fallen to 49.9 in November.\nIt is the first time the PMI reading has dropped below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction since October last year, and is the first major reading of Britain\u2019s economic growth covering the period after the Budget, when taxes were increased by \u00a340bn.\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: \u201cThe first survey on the health of the economy after the Budget makes for gloomy reading.\n\u201cBusinesses have reported falling output for the first time in just over a year while employment has now been cut for two consecutive months.\n\u201cAlthough only marginal, the downturns in output and hiring represent marked contrasts to the robust growth rates seen back in the summer and are accompanied by deepening concern about prospects for the year ahead.\u201d\n09:20 AM GMT\nEurozone private sector slumps amid \u2018political mess\u2019\nBusiness activity in the eurozone contracted for the second time in three months in November, as weak demand saw companies facing challenges securing orders, a closely watched survey showed.\nThe HCOB Flash Eurozone purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) published by S&P Global registered a figure of 48.1 compared to 50.0 in October. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below 50 shows contraction.\nDr Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: \u201cThings could hardly have turned out much worse.\n\u201cThe eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector is sinking deeper into recession, and now the services sector is starting to struggle after two months of marginal growth.\n\u201cIt is no surprise really, given the political mess in the biggest eurozone economies lately \u2013 France\u2019s government is on shaky ground, and Germany\u2019s heading for early elections.\n\u201cThrow in the election of Donald Trump as US president, and it is no wonder the economy is facing challenges.

Health and beauty had yet another strong month of sales growth, especially with the popularity of beauty advent calendars which went on sale.\nThis additional revenue is essential as retailers face over \u00a37bn of additional costs in 2025 alone, as changes to employers\u2019 National Insurance contributions, the increase in minimum wage, and new packaging taxes come into effect.\n\u201cThese changes will pile pressure onto an industry that already pays far more than its fair share in business taxes, and will make job losses and store closures inevitable.\n\u201cTo avoid a cliff edge of costs in April 2025, Government must reconsider the existing timelines for the new packaging levy, while ensuring any changes to business rates offer a meaningful reduction for all retailers as early as possible.\u201d\n07:49 AM GMT\nMild weather hits clothing sales at start of \u2018Golden Quarter\u2019\nClothing stores had a particularly weak month, with industry data suggesting that mild October weather may have caused shoppers to hold off buying more warm winter clothing.\nJacqui Baker, head of retail at RSM UK, said it was a \u201cconcerning start to the Golden Quarter\u201d in the run-up to Christmas when retailers typically make most of their annual sales.\nShe said: \u201cWith half-term falling later this year and relatively mild weather, consumers have put off buying their winter coats and boots.\n\u201cThis has made it difficult for retailers to shift stock, particularly as many have held off spending to take advantage of Black Friday deals.\u201d\nAsif Aziz, retail director at EE added: \u201cOctober has been a quiet month on the high street with shoppers clearly keeping their powder dry ahead of Black Friday sales.\n\u201cUncertainty around the Budget will have also fostered a save now, spend tomorrow mindset, as consumers start to factor in increased expenditure in the run-up to Christmas.\u201d\n07:32 AM GMT\nShoppers \u2018held back on spending ahead of the Budget\u2019, says ONS\nONS senior statistician Hannah Finselbach said:\nRetail sales fell back in October following three months of growth.\n07:31 AM GMT\nBudget blamed as retail sales slump\nRetail sales slumped last month, official figures show, as shoppers held back spending ahead of Rachel Reeves\u2019s Budget.\nSales volumes fell 0.7pc in October compared to the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThe figure was down from a rise of 0.1pc in September, which was revised down from a previous estimate of 0.3pc growth.\nIt was also worse than analyst estimates for a fall of 0.3pc.\nONS senior statistician Hannah Finselbach said: \u201cThe fall was driven by a notably poor month for clothing stores, but retailers across the board reported consumers held back on spending ahead of the Budget.\u201d\nIt comes after dozens of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers this week warned the Chancellor that her plans to hike National Insurance will cause staff to be laid off and shops to be shut.\nMajor companies including Tesco, M&S, Boots and B&Q wrote to Ms Reeves saying that job losses were now \u201cinevitable\u201d, as a result of the \u201csheer scale\u201d of the new costs on business.\nIn a letter from over 70 companies, Ms Reeves was told that the sector faces \u00a37bn in increased costs as a result of changes to employers\u2019 National Insurance, a higher minimum wage rise and levies on packaging.\n07:29 AM GMT\nGood morning\nThanks for joining me. Retail sales fell more sharply than expected last month as Budget uncertainty gripped shoppers.\nSales volumes fell 0.7pc in October compared to a downwardly-revised rise of 0.1pc in September as consumers held back on spending ahead of Rachel Reeves\u2019s tax raising speech.\n5 things to start your day\nEnergy price cap rises as Starmer pulls winter fuel payments | Household energy bills will jump by \u00a321 from January\nWhy Reeves\u2019s public sector pay binge means even higher taxes are on the way | The Chancellor is running out of options to pay for her largesse in spending, economists say\nRoyal Navy sonar maker under investigation over bribery claims | Key defence contractor Thales faces \u2018serious allegations\u2019 of bribery and corruption\nItaly, Abu Dhabi and Cyprus woo Britain\u2019s rich after non-dom crackdown | Foreign countries encourage wealthy UK residents to move abroad after Labour\u2019s Budget\nBen Marlow: Big business is cynically exploiting Reeves\u2019s tax bombshell | Royal Mail won\u2019t be the only one to use the Budget as cover to pick customers\u2019 pockets\nWhat happened overnight\nAsian equities rose, with semiconductor companies rallying as investors shook off initial concerns over Nvidia\u2019s revenue outlook. Gold jumped.\nShares in Australia, Japan and South Korea rose. The MSCI Asia Pacific index climbed as much as 0.7pc, as technology stocks in the region rebounded from Thursday\u2019s selloff, encouraged by Nvidia\u2019s gain in the US.\nShares in Hong Kong and China fell, extending losses into midday, after an index of US-listed Chinese stocks dropped 1% Thursday.\nAsian equities are on pace for their first back-to-back monthly losses this year amid strength in the dollar and lingering concerns over the Chinese economy.

So, $1,200 / 0.0044 = $272,727 to generate an income of $100 per month.\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock\u2019s current price.\nStory Continues\nThe dividend yield can change over time due to fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).\nIn summary, income-focused investors may find Apple stock an attractive option for making a steady income of $100 per month by owning 1,191 shares of stock.\nCheck out this article by Benzinga for three companies offering high dividend yields.\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

          "whole_article": "The mobile browser market in the UK is not working well for businesses and consumers and Apple and Google should be investigated further by the competition watchdog, an initial inquiry has said.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s (CMA) independent inquiry group carried out an in-depth assessment of the mobile browser markets, and has raised concerns about how Apple controls how mobile web browsers work on its devices.\nThe CMA opened its investigation after its own market study, published in 2021, found Apple and Google have an effective duopoly on mobile ecosystems, across operating systems, app stores and web browsers on mobile devices, which it said meant the two companies were in a position to effectively set the rules on how mobile browsers work on their respective devices.\nThe independent inquiry group\u2019s initial inquiry found that Apple\u2019s rules in this area restrict competitors from being able to deliver new and innovative features to consumers.\nIt said concerns had been raised by other browser providers, who said that they are unable to offer a full range of features because of how Apple\u2019s iOS and App Store operate.\nIn addition, it said Apple and Google can manipulate how users are presented with choices about which web browser to use on their devices to make their own browsers the clearest or easiest option.\nAs a result, the group has recommended that the CMA prioritises investigating Apple and Google\u2019s activities in mobile ecosystems under new digital markets competition rules coming into force next year.\nMargot Daly, chairwoman of the CMA\u2019s independent inquiry group, said: \u201cMarkets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers.\n\u201cThrough our investigation, we have provisionally found that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK.\n\u201cThe analysis set out in this report and a range of potential interventions considered to address the market issues identified by the group merits consideration by the CMA board under its new powers, which have been specifically designed for digital markets.\n\u201cUnder those new powers, the CMA can consider the case for designating firms with strategic market status, taking account of the interplay between the specific markets that are the subject of this market investigation and Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s wider mobile ecosystems.\u201d\nElsewhere, the group had also looked at the mobile cloud gaming market in the UK, but found that there was no need for the CMA to intervene at this time.\nStory continues\nIn response, Apple said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\u201cWe disagree with the findings in the report\u00a0regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS.\n\u201cWe are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report\u00a0for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act\u00a0would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart.\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI news stories you can\u2019t miss.\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT in late November 2022. Although it had zero fanfare when it was launched, the platform has grown exponentially ever since. As of today, it boasts more than 200 million users worldwide, driven by the generative AI craze that has made it a hit.\nIt can be safe to say that the chatbot had unofficially ushered in the AI era and a race for businesses to capitalize on it. Initially, companies started slowly by integrating artificial intelligence into their offerings to pinpoint what works and what doesn\u2019t.\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News Shaping Wall Street Today\nAs of today, they are taking giant leaps into the AI realm, confident of the fruits they will reap once everything is in place.\n\u201c2023 was really a year of industry and businesses wrapping their heads around AI. 2024 is the year we\u2019re starting to see real-scale deployments of our technology\u201d.\nCountless innovations in AI prove how the technology continues to be a strong force today. In the latest news, Enfabrica, a California-based startup that aims to make AI chips work more efficiently together at scale, recently announced that it has raised $115 million in funding and plans to release its newest chip early next year.\nThe startup is tackling one of the biggest technical problems that has emerged in the AI field. The problem is related to tying tens of thousands (or more) of chips together with a network. \u00a0The chip company strives to allow computing chips to simultaneously talk to more parts of a network.\nAccording to co-founder and CEO Rochan Sankar, current systems can link about 100,000 AI chips before the network slows down. Sankar says chips from Enfabrica could increase this figure to about 500,000 chips, making it possible to train even larger AI models.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become apparent in the last six to nine months that the attributes of that network really drive the capability of that (computing power), whether it\u2019s bandwidth, resiliency or recovery from loss. All these things matter when you start running at scale.\u201d\nIn other news, OpenAI has recently launched a free training course for teachers with non-profit partner Common Sense Media. The training will enable teachers to understand artificial intelligence and use it efficiently. The move comes amid OpenAI promoting a positive image of ChatGPT in education. Previously, ChatGPT had been causing a frenzy as it helped students spin-off papers, complete their homework, and even write novels.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMy goal in this role is to put AI into the hands of every student and every teacher\u2026 and also give them the skills to learn how to do it responsibly and effectively\u201d.\nBelsky revealed that student adoption of ChatGPT is \u201cvery, very high,\u201d and parents are generally supportive, realizing that AI skills as essential for future careers.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The steepness of those lines shows how persistent the favorable revisions trend has been, with analysts seemingly struggling to catch up with how strong underlying business trends have been for Nvidia.\nNvidia\u2019s stock market momentum has made its market capitalization the highest of the Magnificent 7 group at $3.59 trillion, surpassing Apple at $3.45 trillion and Microsoft at $3.07 trillion. Investors\u2019 lukewarm reaction suggests that they have become used to getting far bigger guidance upgrades than what they received this time around. Nvidia\u2019s upgraded guidance is solid, but relatively underwhelming by the company\u2019s own standards.\nWe don\u2019t want to come across as making too big of a deal of the stock\u2019s reaction to the quarterly results. After all, Nvidia shares are up +191.3% over the past year and have handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (up +32.5%), the S&P 500 index (up +30.4%), and the Mag 7 group (up +20.6%).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBeyond Nvidia, the focus lately has been on the Retail sector, with several major conventional operators coming out with quarterly results. Through Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 29 of the 34 Retail sector companies in the S&P 500 index.\nRegular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players.\nTotal Q3 earnings for these 29 retailers that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 58.6% beating EPS estimates and only 51.7% beating revenue estimates.\nStory Continues\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, members of the Zacks Retail sector have struggled to beat estimates in Q3, with the trend particularly notable on the EPS beats front that are tracking below the 20-quarter low at this stage.\nConcerning the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 24 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +71.6% on +11% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is now a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon\u2019s results (left side chart) and without Amazon\u2019s numbers (right side chart).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nThrough Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 476 S&P 500 members, or 92.2% of the index\u2019s total membership. We have another 8 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this holiday-shortened week, including Dell, HP, Best Buy, and others.\nTotal earnings for these 476 companies that have reported are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 73.7% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates.\nThe proportion of these 476 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51.1%.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. The first set of comparison charts show the earnings and revenue growth rates.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOne significant drag on the aggregate growth pace has been the Energy sector, whose Q3 earnings were down -22.9% from the same period last year on -2.7% lower revenues. Q3 earnings for the index would be up +10.6% on +6.3% higher revenues had it not been for this Energy sector drag. The comparison charts below show the ex-Energy earnings and revenue growth pace across different periods.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe second set of comparison charts compare the Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below spotlight the revenue performance and the blended beats percentage for this group of 476 index members.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the growth trend appears stable-to-positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter averages.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues.\nThe chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.\nHad it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +10.6% instead of +8.1%. Excluding the Tech sector\u2019s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be up only +2.9% instead of +8.1%.\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +2.4% instead of +8.1%.\nFor the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues.\nUnlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better, as the chart below shows.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with the +7.9% earnings growth this year followed by double-digit gains in 2025 and 2026.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +7.9% earnings growth improves to +9.9% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Walmart and Target: A Closer Look at Retail Earnings\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is investing an additional $4 billion in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, boosting its stake in one of OpenAI\u2019s chief rivals.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future\nNYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge\nTrump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy\nNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes\nTokyo\u2019s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\nThe new infusion, announced by the companies on Friday, follows a $4 billion investment in Anthropic completed earlier this year. That deal included provisions that Anthropic use Amazon Web Services data centers for some of its computing needs, as well as AWS-designed AI chips. Anthropic also has close ties with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\nThe latest investment \u201cestablishes AWS as our primary cloud and training partner,\u201d Anthropic said in a blog post, adding that the startup plans to use Amazon\u2019s AI chips to develop its most advanced models. The deal maintains Amazon\u2019s minority stake in the company, Anthropic said. As with Amazon\u2019s original $4 billion infusion, this deal takes the form of convertible notes. Amazon\u2019s initial additional investment will be $1.3 billion, with the rest to follow.\nFounded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, Anthropic has become one of the ChatGPT maker\u2019s closest rivals. Its Claude family of chatbots is widely seen as among the most capable of generating text from scratch. Anthropic has gained traction selling AI software to businesses, including finance and healthcare firms. And Amazon has used its close relationship with Anthropic to bolster its credentials in AI services, offering the Claude models to clients on the AWS marketplace of AI model providers.\nThe additional investment from Amazon highlights the enthusiasm for AI products and the immense capital needs for building the large language models that underpin them. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in funding in October at a $157 billion valuation. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, meanwhile, has been seeking to raise funding at a $40 billion valuation, Bloomberg previously reported.\nAnthropic Chief Executive Officer Dario Amodei has said he expects the costs of developing larger AI models could eventually grow to $100 billion, up from $100 million this year. Like other leading AI developers, however, Anthropic has also seen some diminishing returns from its costly efforts to build more advanced artificial intelligence models, Bloomberg previously reported. Anthropic has seen the timetable slip for the release of its long-awaited Claude model called 3.5 Opus.\nStory Continues\nAnthropic and other AI companies have also seen their funding deals come under scrutiny from regulators who worry that big tech is using large investments and cloud computing partnerships to dominate the emerging AI sector.\nThe UK\u2019s competition watchdog recently cleared the prior investments from Amazon and Google into Anthropic. But the US Justice Department is now seeking to unwind Google\u2019s Anthropic deal in particular.\nAmazon shares were little changed as the markets opened in New York on Friday.\n--With assistance from Rachel Metz.\n(Updates with details on deal, beginning in the third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nClear\u2019s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End\nAn Airline\u2019s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nJaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks on the list.\nWith the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least.\nNaturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled \u2018Global Strategy Paper No. 71,\u00a0 the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This \u2018concentration\u2019 refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence.\nSince the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos\u2019 eCommerce company, and the world\u2019s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns.\nAs per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index \u201cby an annualized 200 bp-800 bp\u201d over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today\u2019s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI\u2019s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang\u2019s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade.\nGS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market\u2019s performance of the two indexes before the bubble\u2019s \u2018pop\u2019 to point out that \u201cthe trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).\u201d This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall \u201chas been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.\u201d\nStory Continues\nLinking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this \u201cextreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.\u201d Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then \u201cthis would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.\u201d\nWhile stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk\u2019s car company record stunning gains. Goldman\u2019s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that \u201cthe biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.\u201d He shared that \u201cany sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.\u201d These include \u201cenergy, traditional energy versus renewables\u201d with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%.\nTuteja added that \u201cthe resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election\u201d was a standout from the market\u2019s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that \u201cwhat I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.\u201d This is because \u201cit takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.\u201d According to him, in 2016, \u201cregional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.\u201d Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that \u201cunder the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime\u2019s policies.\u201d\nFor some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now.\nWithin this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024\u2019s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings \u201cgrowth alone can explain 40% of next quarter\u2019s cash spending growth.\u201d\nJust like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the \u201ctypical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.\u201d Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects \u201ccash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,\u201d but cautions that \u201cthe potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 top growth investment stocks, we used the bank\u2019s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm\u2019s cash flow from operations.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nGrowth Investment Ratio: 137%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the dominating players in the global eCommerce and cloud computing industries. These provide it with access to a volume-heavy business in the form of eCommerce, and a margin-heavy, recurring revenue-friendly business through cloud computing. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the few companies in the world with access to a foundational AI model. Called Claude, this model is courtesy of the firm\u2019s investment in Anthropic \u2013 a firm set up by former OpenAI employees. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s resources, as evidenced by $71 billion in cash and equivalents, also provide it with the resources to develop an end-to-end AI stack. The latest bit on this front is a custom AI chip that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) believes will help it compete with NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs on a cost basis. Additionally, the firm also hopes to provide businesses access to NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs through its cloud computing business. On the e-commerce front, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s business depends on high volumes and sustained consumer spending in key seasons such as the upcoming holiday season.\nPolen Capital mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cThe largest absolute detractors were Alphabet, Airbnb, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon\u2019s position as a notable detractor speaks more to the size of the position than the magnitude of the underperformance, as the company delivered a solid set of results during the quarter.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 11th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(Sarah Stier/Getty Images for Netflix) \u00b7 Sarah Stier via Getty Images\nSince the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged roughly 85%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.\nStory Continues\nLast week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.\nNetflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyonc\u00e9 will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.\nThe company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nJefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a \"breakthrough\" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.\nBofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, \"Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.\"\nNetflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.\nStill, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat \u2014 a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.\n\"With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.\nValuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock \"is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025.\" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "By Caroline Valetkevitch\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Netflix shares were on track for a fifth consecutive gain on Friday and set for their biggest weekly percentage rise since January, after the streaming media company's popular boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul.\nThe stock was last up 0.2% at $899.06, off its intraday record high of $908 on Thursday. It has risen every session since the Nov. 15 fight, taking the stock up more than 9% for the week.\nSeveral brokerages this week raised their price targets on the stock, including BofA Global Research, which on Thursday bumped up its price target to $1,000 from $800.\nNetflix said on Tuesday that 108 million people worldwide watched the match between Paul, a 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prize-fighter, and the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Tyson. The event, which Paul won, was streamed live on Netflix.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nJefferies analysts, which also raised their 12-month target on Netflix to $1,000 this week, wrote in a note on Monday that the event was \"a major breakthrough for NFLX's live events strategy.\"\nThe median 12-month price target on Netflix is $800, with 31 analysts rating the stock a \"buy\" or \"strong buy,\" 14 rating it a \"hold,\" and two analysts rating it a \"sell,\" according to LSEG data.\nKenneth Leon, vice president and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note this week: \"NFLX is flexing its streaming capability with select live sporting events that draw from a global subscriber base.\"\n\"Advertising is still in the early stages, but is expected to be a revenue driver by 2026,\" Leon noted. CFRA also raised its price target on Netflix.\nIncluding the session move, the stock is up roughly 85% for the year.\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; additional reporting by Lance Tupper; Editing by Rod Nickel)\nView Comments"

These companies have millions of digital customers\u2014and billions of interactions with them. They are using the insights from this data to rapidly optimize each customer\u2019s next experience.\nIn the age of artificial intelligence, competitive advantage is increasingly determined by a company's ability to deliver personalized experiences at scale. We call this phenomenon the \u201cpersonalization advantage,\u201d which can be expressed by a simple formula:\nP = n \u00d7 v2\nP represents the competitive advantage of personalization.\nN is the volume of interactions from which the company can learn.\nV is the speed of learning, which has an exponential impact.\nThe Personalization Advantage formula illustrates why these companies are winning: they have both scale (n) in terms of customer interactions and speed (v) in learning from and acting on these interactions.\nPersonalization is not just customization\u2014it\u2019s about using customer data to deliver experiences tailored in real-time, evolving with each interaction. Whether it's a website suggesting products you didn't know you needed based on prior behavior, a call center agent knowing your shopping history with the company, or a sales associate remembering your preferences, the key is scaling these interactions across millions of customers and constantly learning from them.\nPersonalization is creating experiences at scale that get fine-tuned with each successive interaction, empowering customers to get what they want better, faster, cheaper, or more easily. The difference lies in the way personalized communications build on everything the company learns about the customer over time, and about how other customers like them behave. In our experience across industries and consumer contexts, this is what makes personalization truly effective. This effectiveness is directly linked to the Personalization Advantage formula. The more interactions a company has (n), and the faster it can learn from them (v), the greater its personalization advantage (P) becomes.\nIt is enabled by the many different forms of AI available: machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and others, often combined together. Business is now effectively at the point where competitive advantage will be based on a company\u2019s ability to relentlessly capture, analyze, and utilize customer data, at a massive scale, with every possible contact\u2014and on how it uses that data to understand, shape, personalize, and optimize each customer\u2019s journey.\nStory Continues\nBuilding economies of scale has always been important in business, especially in the physical aspects of competition: supply chains, production, and distribution. However, personalization changes the nature of scale in the customer experience from the mass production of goods to the mass delivery of 1:1 experiences built on accumulated intelligence. Personalization at scale, and the ongoing cycle of experimentation and learning that power it, create a competitive moat that is very hard to replicate. This competitive moat is precisely what our Personalization Advantage formula quantifies.\nIt\u2019s about scale (n)\nCompanies such as Alipay, Amazon, Tencent, Flipkart, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify have each amassed over 200 million active users. The sheer size of their digital customer base is enormous. They distill insights about these users not just when they transact, but every time they browse or click in a digital channel. But even non-digital native companies are maximizing the \u201csurface area\u201d they have for gathering and using customer information\u2014like an alarm company understanding how homeowners use their touchpads or B2B distributors tracking the frequency and nature of replenishment orders.\nThese companies even know the lifetime value of each new active user they add\u2014and invest accordingly. For example, a large food and beverage company we\u2019ve worked with estimated that each 10 million new digital customer relationships would add $1 billion in incremental revenue.\nIt\u2019s about speed (v)\nUltimately, personalization is about what companies do with the insights about their customers. This is where companies are competing on speed. Speed in getting to know the customer throughout the customer journey, speed in executing based on a trigger about a customer, and speed in constantly improving the experience based on that knowledge. We are big believers in the importance of \u201ctime-based competition,\u201d the concept of competing on the basis of speed. In personalization, it is foundational.\nThe squared term in our formula (v2) emphasizes the outsized impact of speed. Doubling the speed of learning and execution more than doubles the personalization advantage.\nIt is no coincidence that companies across a wide swath of categories, including home improvement, banking, restaurants, grocery, and apparel have publicly announced that personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences are central to their corporate strategy. These companies understand that maximizing both (n) and (v) in the Personalization Advantage formula is crucial for their success.\nBy studying hundreds of personalization leaders over the past decade, we have even quantified the size of the personalization advantage pioneering companies are capturing in terms of growth. Across industries, we find that personalization leaders consistently outgrow laggards. In fact, leaders grow top-line revenues 10 points faster per year than laggards. Taken together, we estimate that by the end of this decade, the personalization leaders, on a combined basis, will capture almost $2 trillion in incremental growth.\nThe basis of competition has shifted\u2014and the prize for those that rethink their business model accordingly is enormous. But here\u2019s the catch. Our research also finds that only 10% of companies qualify as personalization leaders. Many businesses say they are doing personalization but fail to go beyond basic segmented marketing. They end up sending more spam, generating more calls from complaining customers, and frustrating themselves with slower growth than expected. These laggards are failing to optimize both (n) and (v) in the personalization advantage formula, limiting their growth potential.\nMore must-read\u00a0commentary\u00a0published by\u00a0Fortune:\nShell\u2019s Pyrrhic victory may well set the stage for more corporate climate accountability\nDemis Hassabis-James Manyika: AI will help us understand the very fabric of reality\nI worked with Steve Jobs.

The company's recent successes with events like the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match, which drew 108 million average viewers, demonstrate its potential in the live streaming arena. However, technical challenges during these events raise questions about the platform's readiness for major live programming.\nTechnical Infrastructure Concerns\nNetflix's strategic expansion into live streaming, marked by high-profile events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the $5 billion WWE deal, demonstrates its commitment to diversifying content offerings beyond traditional streaming. However, widespread streaming issues and buffering problems plagued many viewers. These technical difficulties are particularly concerning as the company prepares for even bigger events, including two NFL Christmas Day games and the upcoming launch of WWE's Monday Night Raw in 2025.\n\nThe platform's ability to handle large-scale concurrent streaming remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed. Despite these short-term hurdles, Netflix's strong market position, growing advertising business and comprehensive entertainment strategy suggest long-term potential. However, given the significant investments required and execution risks in live programming, investors might benefit from waiting for stronger evidence of successful implementation before increasing exposure.\nStrategic Content Acquisitions\nNetflix's $5 billion deal with WWE for Monday Night Raw represents a significant investment in live programming. Combined with NFL games and special events featuring major entertainers like Beyonc\u00e9, the company is positioning itself as a comprehensive entertainment destination. This diversification strategy could help Netflix maintain its competitive edge in an increasingly crowded streaming landscape.\n\nNetflix expects paid net additions to be higher sequentially in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects substantial growth in paid subscribers, with total paid memberships expected to reach 290.54 million by the end of 2024, indicating an 11.6% year-over-year increase.\nFinancial Implications and Growth Prospects\nThe company expects revenues to grow in the range of 11-13% in 2025, reaching $43-$44 billion. This growth rate represents a slowdown from the 15% expected in 2024. Netflix's investment in live content and infrastructure improvements may pressure margins in the short term, though management targets a 28% operating margin for 2025.\n\nWith total debt reaching $15.98 billion and streaming content obligations at $22.7 billion, Netflix faces significant financial commitments.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $38.91 billion, indicating 15.37% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $19.78 per share, indicating a substantial 64.42% increase from the previous year.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nThe recent surge in Netflix's stock price has led to expanded valuation multiples, potentially limiting future upside for investors. The company's forward 12-month sales multiple of 8.73 exceeds its five-year median of 6.53, indicating that the stock may be trading at a premium to its historical valuation. Moreover, this multiple surpasses the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward earnings multiple of 3.4, suggesting that Netflix's valuation is stretched relative to its peers.\nPrice-to-Sales (Forward 12 Months)\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMarket Position and Competition\nAs traditional media companies increasingly bundle their services, Netflix is taking a different approach by expanding its standalone offering. The addition of live sports and entertainment could help justify future price increases and reduce churn. However, the technical challenges and high costs associated with live programming present risks.\n\nInvestors have responded enthusiastically to Netflix's performance, with NFLX shares returning an impressive 81.5% year to date, significantly outperforming tech giants like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.\nYear-to-date Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Outlook\nWhile Netflix's push into live streaming shows promise, current investors should maintain their positions but new investors might want to wait for a better entry point. The company needs to prove that it can consistently deliver high-quality live streaming experiences before the market fully prices in this growth opportunity. Additionally, the significant investments required for live content rights and technical infrastructure may impact near-term profitability.\nConclusion\nNetflix's venture into live streaming represents both an opportunity and a challenge. While the strategy could strengthen its market position, technical hurdles and high costs suggest caution. Current shareholders should remain invested to benefit from the company's long-term potential, but new investors might find better entry points after Netflix demonstrates consistent execution in live programming delivery.

A Florida-based person named Ronald Blue Denton sued Netflix in state court for what he considered a shoddy performance in delivering the event to its clients in sharp craving, stating that Netflix was unstoppably ill-equipped for the demand for the show, making it unwatchable.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Netflix violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and breached the parties' contract while also demanding monetary damages and a class action on behalf of other affected Netflix subscribers. According to Denton, Netflix is guilty of abdicating its role as a service provider since it failed to provide a perfect viewing experience for millions of people.\nThe November 15 fight that Netflix promoted as its primary sports event attracted 108 million viewers worldwide. Nonetheless, many people used social networks to complain about the declining video quality, numerous instances of buffering, and completely frozen streams, especially if the moment in the match was important.\nNetflix included the topic as part of a significant milestone in sports streaming to establish its dominance in the live segment. Denton's lawsuit now appears to potentially overshadow the feat and is symbolic of the dangers of mounting highly visible live events when viewer expectations steadily rise.\nThis legal dispute could try Netflix for various technical problems and issue a challenge to how the company plans to handle mass streaming events as it faces increasing competition in live sports rights.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\nFox Corporation and Netflix are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FOX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nFOX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.71, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 44.06. We also note that FOX has a PEG ratio of 1.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.68.\nAnother notable valuation metric for FOX is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 16.39.\nBased on these metrics and many more, FOX holds a Value grade of A, while NFLX has a Value grade of D.\nFOX sticks out from NFLX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FOX is the better option right now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "By Jessie Pang\nHONG KONG (Reuters) -Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Saturday that global collaboration and cooperation in technology will continue, even if the incoming U.S. administration imposes stricter export controls on advanced computing products.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, in his first term in office, imposed a series of restrictions on the sale of U.S. technology to China citing national security concerns - a policy broadly continued under incumbent President Joe Biden.\n\"Open science in global collaboration, cooperation across math and science has been around for a very long time. It is the foundation of social advancement and scientific advancement,\" Huang told media during a visit to Hong Kong.\nGlobal cooperation is \"going to continue. I don't know what's going to happen in the new administration, but whatever happens, we'll balance simultaneously compliance with laws and policies, continue to advance our technology and support and serve customers all over the world.\"\nEarlier on Saturday Huang told graduates and academics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology that \"the age of AI has started\" in a speech after receiving an honorary doctorate degree in engineering.\nThe head of the world's leading maker of chips used for artificial intelligence applications received the award alongside actor Tony Leung, Nobel Prize for Chemistry winner Prof. Michael Levitt and Fields Medallist Prof. David Mumford.\n\"The age of AI has started. A new computing era that will impact every industry and every field of science,\" said Huang.\nHe said Nvidia has \"reinvented computing and sparked a new industrial revolution,\" 25 years after inventing the graphics processing unit.\n\"AI is certainly the most important technology of our time, and potentially of all times.\"\nHuang, 61, also told graduates that he wished he had started his career at this time.\n\"The whole world is reset. You're at the starting lines with everybody else. An industry is being reinvented. You now have the instruments, the instruments necessary to advance science in so many different fields,\" Huang said.\n\"The greatest challenges of our time, unimaginable challenges to overcome in the past, all of a sudden seem possible to tackle.\"\nIn the afternoon, Huang will participate in a fireside chat with the university's Council Chairman Harry Sham, teachers and students.\n(Reporting by Jessie Pang; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

In the case of NVIDIA (NVDA), a stock that has seen meteoric rise, revisiting past assessments can shed light on the challenges of predicting future market trends, even for seasoned investors.\nOn August 5th, several media outlets reported famous activist hedge fund Elliott Management's statements about AI hype and NVDA bubble. We summarized those statements in an article:\n\"Billionaire Paul Singer\u2019s\u00a0Elliott Management\u00a0has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in \u201cbubble land\u201d and Nvidia is \u201coverhyped.\u201d The fund said in its letter that it\u2019s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is \u201coverhyped with many applications not ready for prime time\u201d. It also claimed that many AI use cases are \u201cnever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\u201d The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver \u201cvalue commensurate with the hype\u201d.\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are \u201cfew real uses\u201d of AI other than \u201csummarizing notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding\u201d.\nPaul Singer of Elliott Management\nElliott's letter was dated July 30th and predicted that the AI bubble will burst when NVDA \" has bad numbers and breaks the spell.\". Here is an excerpt from that letter:\n\"Speaking of NVIDIA . . .\nStory Continues\nInterestingly NVDA shares hit a low of $92 on August 5th when the Elliott news came out.

These announcements have served to bolster the hype around companies that build data centers. For example, Crusoe Energy, a startup building data centers for large AI firms, plans to raise more than $800 million in funding, per regulatory filings. The filings detail that the company has already raised close to $685 million of the $818 million in total that it is seeking, with seventy investors contributing to the funding. Crusoe is one of many crypto-origin firms that have pivoted to AI in recent months.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nA report by consulting firm McKinsey reveals that global demand for data center capacity could rise at an annual rate of between 19%-22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts. McKinsey analysis suggests that demand for AI-ready data center capacity will rise at an average rate of 33% a year between 2023 and 2030 in a midrange scenario. Per the consulting firm, this means that around 70% of total demand for data center capacity will be for data centers equipped to host advanced-AI workloads by 2030. Gen AI, currently the fastest-growing advanced-AI use case, will account for around 40 percent of the total, the report underlines.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of technicians assembling a complex electrical connector in a factory environment.\nAmphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nAmphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) primarily designs, manufactures, and markets electrical, electronic, and fiber optic connectors. It has a range of product offerings for AI firms, including chipsets, networking products, and server and GPU solutions. On November 21, investment advisory Evercore released an investor note on the AI industry, noting that the strong earnings and guidance of NVIDIA had wide-ranging implications for a number of other companies, including Amphenol Corporation. Per the advisory, ramping Blackwell shipments in the Jan-qtr and through FY26, as well as management commentary on being on track to exceed prior Q4 shipment expectations, is a positive read through for Amphenol, given it is a supplier to the system.\nStory Continues\nOverall APH ranks 9th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and rankings. While we acknowledge the potential of APH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The S&P 500 rose 0.3% while an equal-weighted version of the gauge \u2014 where Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. has the same influence as Nvidia Corp. \u2014 climbed 0.8%, on track for an all-time closing high.\nListen and follow The Big Take daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% while an index of bank stocks climbed to the highest in more than two years, the Russell 2000 jumped 1.8%. The small-cap index climbed 4.5% this week while the biggest technology stocks, like Nvidia, Alphabet Inc. and Facebook-parent company Meta Platforms Inc., lagged.\nFundstrat\u2019s Thomas Lee sees room for more gains in small-caps and cyclicals given President-elect\u2019s plans for deregulation and general \u201canimal spirits.\u201d He also sees a \u201cTrump put\u201d keeping the broader market buoyant. Faith that the government and Donald Trump won\u2019t let the economy knuckle under is helping bolster stocks, at least for the moment.\n\u201cWhen sentiment reaches a \u2018bullish extreme\u2019 is when we see equities priced to \u2018perfection,\u2019\u201d according to Lee. \u201cBy several measures, we are not there at that point yet.\u201d\nTo Bank of America Corp. strategists the Nasdaq 100, which has rallied more than 4% this month, is approaching a level versus the S&P 500 that could trigger the unwinding of the trade favoring US equities. The tech-heavy gauge ended Friday up 0.2% with a 1.9% weekly gain.\nMeanwhile, data on Friday showed S&P Global flash November composite output index for service providers and manufacturers advanced to 55.3 \u2014 the highest level since April 2022. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped around one basis point to 4.41%.\n\u201cThe US flash PMIs for November were bullish in aggregate thanks to strength in services,\u201d according to Vital Knowledge\u2019s Adam Crisafulli, who said the details suggested a goldilocks scenario, \u201cwith favorable growth developments and cooling price pressures.\u201d\nStory Continues\nThe dollar registered its longest streak of weekly wins since September 2023. A Bloomberg gauge of the currency\u2019s strength has risen around 2.6% so far this month, adding to October\u2019s gains of nearly 3%.\n\u201cThe US dollar\u2019s run can continue,\u201d said Peter McLean, head of multi-asset portfolio solutions at Stonehage Fleming. \u201cWe also have those geopolitical tensions, which are escalating at the moment.

His tenure was marked by a flurry of crypto enforcement actions, which the industry expects will peter out under Trump.\nIn Europe, S&P Global\u2019s composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for the euro area dipped back beneath a level that indicates contraction in November.

          "whole_article": "Nvidia\u2019s NVDA quarterly results were excellent, with the chip giant not only beating estimates and raising guidance but also achieving top- and bottom-line growth rates that are typically associated with start-up players.\nNvidia\u2019s Q3 earnings increased +106.3% from the year-earlier period to $19.37 billion while revenues were up +93.6% year-over-year to +35.08 billion.\nTo get a sense of the market\u2019s lukewarm reaction to these otherwise impressive results from Nvidia, take a look at the chart below that plots the stock price relative to how estimates consensus EPS estimates have evolved over time.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart's light blue and red lines represent the evolution of consensus EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025, respectively. The steepness of those lines shows how persistent the favorable revisions trend has been, with analysts seemingly struggling to catch up with how strong underlying business trends have been for Nvidia.\nNvidia\u2019s stock market momentum has made its market capitalization the highest of the Magnificent 7 group at $3.59 trillion, surpassing Apple at $3.45 trillion and Microsoft at $3.07 trillion. Investors\u2019 lukewarm reaction suggests that they have become used to getting far bigger guidance upgrades than what they received this time around. Nvidia\u2019s upgraded guidance is solid, but relatively underwhelming by the company\u2019s own standards.\nWe don\u2019t want to come across as making too big of a deal of the stock\u2019s reaction to the quarterly results. After all, Nvidia shares are up +191.3% over the past year and have handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (up +32.5%), the S&P 500 index (up +30.4%), and the Mag 7 group (up +20.6%).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBeyond Nvidia, the focus lately has been on the Retail sector, with several major conventional operators coming out with quarterly results. Through Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 29 of the 34 Retail sector companies in the S&P 500 index.\nRegular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players.\nTotal Q3 earnings for these 29 retailers that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 58.6% beating EPS estimates and only 51.7% beating revenue estimates.\nStory Continues\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, members of the Zacks Retail sector have struggled to beat estimates in Q3, with the trend particularly notable on the EPS beats front that are tracking below the 20-quarter low at this stage.\nConcerning the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 24 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +71.6% on +11% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is now a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon\u2019s results (left side chart) and without Amazon\u2019s numbers (right side chart).\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nThrough Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 476 S&P 500 members, or 92.2% of the index\u2019s total membership. We have another 8 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this holiday-shortened week, including Dell, HP, Best Buy, and others.\nTotal earnings for these 476 companies that have reported are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 73.7% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates.\nThe proportion of these 476 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51.1%.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. The first set of comparison charts show the earnings and revenue growth rates.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOne significant drag on the aggregate growth pace has been the Energy sector, whose Q3 earnings were down -22.9% from the same period last year on -2.7% lower revenues. Q3 earnings for the index would be up +10.6% on +6.3% higher revenues had it not been for this Energy sector drag. The comparison charts below show the ex-Energy earnings and revenue growth pace across different periods.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe second set of comparison charts compare the Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below spotlight the revenue performance and the blended beats percentage for this group of 476 index members.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the growth trend appears stable-to-positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter averages.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues.\nThe chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.\nHad it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +10.6% instead of +8.1%. Excluding the Tech sector\u2019s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be up only +2.9% instead of +8.1%.\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +2.4% instead of +8.1%.\nFor the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues.\nUnlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better, as the chart below shows.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with the +7.9% earnings growth this year followed by double-digit gains in 2025 and 2026.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +7.9% earnings growth improves to +9.9% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Walmart and Target: A Closer Look at Retail Earnings\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has delivered better-than-expected sales and earnings in its latest quarterly report as it continues to progress banking on the incessant demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\nAmid the recent data center success, NVIDIA stock remains attractively priced, exhibits a bullish trend, and is fundamentally strong, making it a good buy for investors. Let\u2019s see in detail \u2013\nNVIDIA Stock \u2013 Positive Q3 Data Center Result & Outlook\nNVIDIA recently reported fiscal third-quarter results, in which its revenues jumped 94% to $35.1 billion from the same period a year ago. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.81, up 103% from a year ago.\nThe company\u2019s revenues exceeded Wall Street expectations due to record gains from the data center business. Third-quarter revenues from the data center came in at $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago.\nCEO Jensen Huang admitted that demand for its Superchips and related hardware was robust, particularly for its present Hopper chips. Huang expects continued high demand for Hopper chips into next year.\nThe advanced H200 chips will be available in several cloud services, such as Azure, Google Cloud and AWS. Beyond big tech cloud operators, Denmark launched its AI supercomputer driven by H100 Tensor Core graphic processing units (GPUs). The government\u2019s demand for Hopper chips, beyond private companies, fuels NVIDIA\u2019s growing data center business in the information arms race.\nBut it\u2019s not all about Hopper chips, Huang clarified that the demand for the much-awaited next-generation Blackwell chips remains \u201cstaggering\u201d for the fourth quarter and next year.\nCompanies like Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Meta Platforms, Inc. META will likely adopt the Blackwell chips for higher AI throughput than the current Hopper chips. The Blackwell platform can enhance AI training performance and train large language models cost-effectively.\nAccording to SoftBank Corp, NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell platform will build Japan\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer. Also, NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell platform may power Taiwan\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer. Therefore, the data center business will drive NVIDIA\u2019s success and increase its share price, making it an enticing buy.\nNVIDIA Stock is Less Pricey Than Its Peers\nNVIDIA\u2019s strong third-quarter performance comes as no surprise since the company has been delivering promising quarterly results for quite some time. NVIDIA is one of the top performers on the S&P 500 and is the most valuable company.\nDespite all the success, buying NVIDIA stock as of now will burn a smaller hole in your pocket than its peers. After all, per the price/earnings, the NVDA stock trades at 51.7X forward earnings, less than the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 59.6X forward earnings multiple.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA Stock Has Bullish Chart Patterns\nDespite NVIDIA\u2019s commendable third-quarter performance, its share price dipped initially as the hype surrounding its earnings results was insane. The stock was in overbought territory and a short-term dip after the earnings release was inevitable.\nHowever, the NVIDIA stock is currently trading above the short-term 50-day moving average (DMA) and long-term 200-DMA, a tell-tale bullish trend, making it a sound investment option.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA Stock is Fundamentally Solid\nNVIDIA has been able to manage its costs efficiently and generate profits persistently for a somewhat long time, which anyhow makes it the best stock to invest in.\nNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, higher than the industry\u2019s 47.3%. Any reading greater than 20% indicates a high profit margin.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSimilarly, NVIDIA\u2019s return on equity (ROE) of 120.4% exceeded the industry average of 78.3%, showcasing that the net income surpassed equity.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA, thus, rightfully has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (read more: This Is Why NVIDIA Joined the Dow; And Why It's Time to Buy).

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nTechnology giants in the United States have pledged tens of billions towards building AI data centers in the next few years. These announcements have served to bolster the hype around companies that build data centers. For example, Crusoe Energy, a startup building data centers for large AI firms, plans to raise more than $800 million in funding, per regulatory filings. The filings detail that the company has already raised close to $685 million of the $818 million in total that it is seeking, with seventy investors contributing to the funding. Crusoe is one of many crypto-origin firms that have pivoted to AI in recent months.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nA report by consulting firm McKinsey reveals that global demand for data center capacity could rise at an annual rate of between 19%-22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts. McKinsey analysis suggests that demand for AI-ready data center capacity will rise at an average rate of 33% a year between 2023 and 2030 in a midrange scenario. Per the consulting firm, this means that around 70% of total demand for data center capacity will be for data centers equipped to host advanced-AI workloads by 2030. Gen AI, currently the fastest-growing advanced-AI use case, will account for around 40 percent of the total, the report underlines.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 160\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. On November 21, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $212. In an investor note, the analyst noted that proposed DOJ remedies in a Google antitrust case are more punitive than expected. Per the analyst, the DOJ seeks to prohibit Google from offering anything of value to Apple and other third-party distributors, which could push Apple to explore other options, including shifting default search from Google to a competitor such as OpenAI.\nStory Continues\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and rankings. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is investing an additional $4 billion in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, boosting its stake in one of OpenAI\u2019s chief rivals.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future\nNYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge\nTrump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy\nNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes\nTokyo\u2019s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\nThe new infusion, announced by the companies on Friday, follows a $4 billion investment in Anthropic completed earlier this year. That deal included provisions that Anthropic use Amazon Web Services data centers for some of its computing needs, as well as AWS-designed AI chips. Anthropic also has close ties with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\nThe latest investment \u201cestablishes AWS as our primary cloud and training partner,\u201d Anthropic said in a blog post, adding that the startup plans to use Amazon\u2019s AI chips to develop its most advanced models. The deal maintains Amazon\u2019s minority stake in the company, Anthropic said. As with Amazon\u2019s original $4 billion infusion, this deal takes the form of convertible notes. Amazon\u2019s initial additional investment will be $1.3 billion, with the rest to follow.\nFounded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, Anthropic has become one of the ChatGPT maker\u2019s closest rivals. Its Claude family of chatbots is widely seen as among the most capable of generating text from scratch. Anthropic has gained traction selling AI software to businesses, including finance and healthcare firms. And Amazon has used its close relationship with Anthropic to bolster its credentials in AI services, offering the Claude models to clients on the AWS marketplace of AI model providers.\nThe additional investment from Amazon highlights the enthusiasm for AI products and the immense capital needs for building the large language models that underpin them. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in funding in October at a $157 billion valuation. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, meanwhile, has been seeking to raise funding at a $40 billion valuation, Bloomberg previously reported.\nAnthropic Chief Executive Officer Dario Amodei has said he expects the costs of developing larger AI models could eventually grow to $100 billion, up from $100 million this year.

Apple does this by restricting progressive web apps, which don't need to be downloaded from an app store and aren't subject to app store commissions, the report said.\n\u201cThis technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,\u201d the watchdog said in a provisional report on its investigation into mobile browsers that it opened after an initial study concluded that Apple and Google effectively have a chokehold on \u201cmobile ecosystems.\u201d\nThe CMA's report also found that Apple and Google manipulate the choices given to mobile phone users to make their own browsers \u201cthe clearest or easiest option.\u201d\nAnd it said that the a revenue-sharing deal between the two U.S. Big Tech companies \u201csignificantly reduces their financial incentives\u201d to compete in mobile browsers on Apple's iOS operating system for iPhones.\nBoth companies said they will \u201cengage constructively\u201d with the CMA.\nApple said it disagreed with the findings and said it was concerned that the recommendations would undermine user privacy and security.\nGoogle said the openness of its Android mobile operating system \u201chas helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratize access to smartphones and apps\" and that it's \u201ccommitted to open platforms that empower consumers.\u201d\nIt's the latest move by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to crack down on the dominance of Big Tech companies. U.S. federal prosecutors this week unveiled their proposals to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser as they target its monopoly in online search.\nThe CMA's final report is due by March. The watchdog indicated it would recommend using the U.K.'s new digital competition rulebook set to take effect next year, which includes new powers to rein in tech companies, to prioritize further investigation into Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s \u201cactivities in mobile ecosystems.\"\nView Comments"

Similar to Amazon's previous $4 billion investment, it comes in the form of convertible notes and comes in phases, first at $1.3 billion.\nAnthropic is also in talks with additional investors to raise more capital on the back of Amazon backing, sources added, who requested anonymity for discussing private matters. Anthropic declined to comment.\nAmazon, which has gradually established itself as Anthropic's primary cloud partner, is fiercely competing with Microsoft and Alphabet's Google to offer AI-powered tools for its cloud customers. AWS is bringing significant revenue to Anthropic as a major distributor of its latest models.\n\"The investment in Anthropic is essential for Amazon to stay in a leadership position in AI,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\nThe e-commerce company's increased investment in Anthropic underscores the billions of dollars funneled into AI startups over the past year, as investors look to cash in on a boom in the technology, which became popular with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022.\nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI raised $6.6 billion from investors last month, which could value the company at $157 billion and cement its position as one of the most valuable private companies in the world.\nAnthropic plans to train and deploy its foundational models on Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips. The intensive process of training AI models requires powerful processors, making securing pricey AI chips a top priority for startups.\n\"It (partnership) also allows Amazon to promote its AI services such as leveraging its AI chips for training and inferencing, which Anthropic is using,\" Luria said.\nNvidia currently dominates the market for AI processors and counts Amazon among its long list of so-called hyperscaler customers.\nStill, Amazon has been working to develop its own chips through its Annapurna Labs division, which Anthropic said it was \"working closely with\" to aid in developing processors.

He observed that even if the Biden government is improving cybersecurity defenses, further actions are required to deter nation-state intrusions.\nAccording to Microsoft's own statistics, its users go through approximately 600 million cyberattacks per day, including state-sponsored entities working on operations and resource sharing alongside criminal organizations.\nTalking on how a Trump presidency may affect the IT industry, Smith said it is too early to say any major impact will result. Any relaxation of U.S. merger and acquisition rules should be evaluated in relation to world norms, he said.\nFollowing recent export restrictions on artificial intelligence chips imposed by the Biden government, Smith also advised the United States to help the transfer of American digital technology to areas such the Middle East and Africa. He underlined the need of developing consistent procedures to let American technology compete internationally.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Microsoft (MSFT) is preparing to roll out its long-delayed artificial intelligence-powered Recall feature for Windows 11 PCs to developers as part of its Windows Insider program.\nThe company initially announced Recall back in May when it debuted its Copilot+ PCs, AI PCs that have a specific set of features for running native AI applications. Recall is designed to capture screenshots of the various tasks you perform while using your computer, whether that\u2019s browsing the web or working on a document.\nThe idea is for you to be able to search through Recall\u2019s screenshots and then be able to take action on them. Say you were searching for flights and hotels for an upcoming trip or doing research for a work project but closed out your browser. You\u2019d be able to search Recall for information related to those topics and pull up the appropriate screenshots.\nWith Microsoft\u2019s Click to Do feature, which is also in preview, you\u2019d then be able to take action on those screenshots. For instance, you\u2019d be able to copy text, navigate back to the website Recall captured, or edit images.\nIt sounds very convenient for keeping track of your activity and going back to tasks you need to finish, but Recall immediately set off alarm bells among security researchers and privacy experts. The fear is that hackers or other cyber criminals could gain access to Recall\u2019s screenshots and get their hands on sensitive user data.\nMicrosoft subsequently made a series of changes to Recall including making it an opt-in feature, rather than an opt-out feature, meaning users have to choose to use it instead of it automatically being available.\nMicrosoft's new Click to Do option provides you with a context sensitive toolbox for taking actions related to what you're viewing on your screen. (Image: Microsoft) \u00b7 Microsoft\nThe company also said Recall screenshots, or Snapshots as Microsoft calls them, are encrypted and can only be accessed using the company\u2019s Windows Hello authentication feature. You can also choose whether or not Recall saves information from specific websites. The app will also recognize when you\u2019re entering sensitive information like credit card numbers, passwords, and other personal identification numbers and temporarily stop saving screenshots.\nMicrosoft also says you\u2019ll be able to disable Recall through the Windows settings menu and that the feature is automatically removed from PCs that are managed by administrators for work and school.\nThe Recall preview will initially only be available for Windows 11 laptops running Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) Snapdragon processors. Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) laptops will have to wait.\nAll of this is part of Microsoft\u2019s effort to get users to buy into its Copilot+ PC effort. The general idea for the platform is to bring generative AI capabilities to Windows PCs through both on-device and cloud-based AI services.\nStory Continues\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMicrosoft already offers its marquee AI feature, Copilot, to users, but is continuing to expand on the software to give users more reasons to upgrade to AI PCs.\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t the only company using AI as a major selling point. Apple has already rolled out its first set of Apple Intelligence features for its iPhone, iPad, and Mac line of products, and Google is outfitting its software and Pixel line of phones with its own AI.\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell if consumers are truly interested in AI just yet, though. If you want Microsoft\u2019s latest Surface laptop outfitted with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chip\u2014an excellent device\u2014you\u2019re buying an AI PC, even if that wasn\u2019t your intention. Ditto if you buy a new iPhone. Even if you\u2019re not interested in the AI features, you\u2019re still buying an AI smartphone.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see just how many users end up taking advantage of AI PC and AI smartphone software and how often they use it to get a better sense of whether the categories are successes in and of themselves.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

He told Sozzi he is now spending $200 million more to address the issue, on top of an initial $100 million pledge revealed in September of this year.\nHe encouraged other wealthy people to join him in the fight against cyberattacks.\n\u201cI tell people, 'Hey, the people who protect us could use some help. The amounts of money comparatively are small, so why not help out,'\u201d he said.\nCraig Newmark, founder of Newmark Philanthropies, speaks during a panel discussion on Sept. 12, 2022. (Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) \u00b7 Pacific Press via Getty Images\nCybersecurity has had a banner year in the spotlight, with issues going beyond past annoyances where consumers simply need to change passwords, call a credit bureau, or cancel an account after a breach.\nThis past summer, a Microsoft (MSFT) Windows update containing a defect hit 8.5 million computers. It resulted in flight cancellations and hampered health and payment services. Concerns swirled about potential infrastructure attacks on a global scale, such as the Paris Olympics.\nIn October, utility company American Water Works (AWK) announced a cybersecurity attack that temporarily shut down its customer portal and paused billing.\n\u2022 USD\n(PANW)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nShares of cybersecurity stocks have subsequently soared: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) are up 38% and 53% year to date, respectively. Wall Street is staying bullish on each stock, according to Yahoo Finance analyst recommendation and price target data.\nThe global financial impact of cybercrimes could reach $13.82 trillion by 2028 from $9.22 trillion in 2024, the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia estimated.\nThe need for municipalities and other government entities to act rather than react remains paramount, warns Newmark.\n\u201cI think a lot about this,\u201d said Newmark. \u201cI\u2019ve started to fund networks of smart volunteers who can help people protect infrastructure, particularly [for] the small companies and utilities across the country who are responsible for most of our electrical and power supplies, transportation infrastructure, [and] food distribution.\u201d\nStory Continues\nListen to more episodes of Opening Bid\nCraigslist founder is giving away $200 million to prevent cybercrimes against the US\nWhy Nvidia stock is ripe for another surge: Investor\nTrump, tariffs, and one unpredictable economy in 2025\n\u201cA lot of these systems have no protection, so an adversary could just compromise them, saying unless you do what we need, we can start shutting off these things,\u201d he continued. Should that happen, recovery \u201ccould take weeks and weeks without your water supply or electricity.\"\nNewmark is a self-professed tech nerd. The IBM alum worked at Big Blue for 17 years before founding Craigslist in 1995.\nWhile he continues to follow Craigslist from afar, Newmark said these days he's most focused on ensuring his wealth ends up at the correct causes.\n\"My deal is that I want all that money to go straight to the nonprofit world \u2014 I just have to figure out where that goes and how do I handle it over the next five to 20 years,\" Newmark said.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

However, as the AI boom plays out, the central bank in Europe has issued a dire warning about the development of an AI bubble. The warning was included in the biannual Financial Stability Review, a report that lists the risks that could threaten the financial well being of world markets. In the review, the European Central Bank noted that the stock market, particularly in the United States, had become increasingly dependent on a handful of companies perceived as the beneficiaries of the AI boom.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPer the ECB, this concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble. It added that in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointing. The ECB further underlined that investors were demanding a low premium to own shares and bonds while funds had cut their cash buffers. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments, the ECB said.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "The upcoming report from CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a decline of 1.2% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $982.26 million, representing an increase of 25% year over year.\nThe current level reflects no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some CrowdStrike metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- Subscription' of $936.57 million. The estimate suggests a change of +27.7% year over year.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenue- Professional services' stands at $49.04 million. The estimate indicates a change of -6.7% from the prior-year quarter.\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- United States' to reach $682.66 million. The estimate indicates a change of +26.9% from the prior-year quarter.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Annual recurring revenue (ARR)' should arrive at $4,001,747.00. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $3,150,000.\nAnalysts expect 'Non-GAAP subscription gross profit' to come in at $752.42 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $588.69 million.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Non-GAAP professional services gross profit' should come in at $16.57 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $23.02 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'GAAP professional services gross profit' reaching $11.95 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $17.38 million.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'GAAP subscription gross profit' will reach $734.84 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $573.63 million.\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for CrowdStrike here>>>\n\nOver the past month, shares of CrowdStrike have returned +17.4% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +17.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.25 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other trending AI stocks that are making waves today.\nIs artificial intelligence a tool for the rich countries and the wealthy? Even if it is, Chinese President Xi Jinping warns that it shouldn\u2019t be. At the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Xi noted that AI shouldn\u2019t be a game of the affluent, calling on more international governance and cooperation on the matter. In a separate meeting in Peru, Xi and Joe Biden also agreed that human beings, and not artificial intelligence, should be making decisions about nuclear weapons, as reported by The White House.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Stories You Can\u2019t Miss and\u00a015 AI News Making Waves Right Now\nThe call for equitable AI development and responsible decision-making underscores the growing global focus on AI's impact, and all the latest developments being made in the AI realm. As the global race to advance AI accelerates, one country striving to secure its position in this competitive landscape is Japan. The country is reportedly readying a $65-billion push in microchips and artificial intelligence, as revealed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this month. The move comes amid the country\u2019s efforts to reclaim its status as a global tech leader.\nNews like these underscores how artificial intelligence continues to be a dominant theme in the business world. A Cisco 2024 AI Readiness Report reveals how companies around the world realize that the momentum for AI deployment is building fast, pulling up immense pressure on them in the process. However, only 13% of companies are ready to leverage AI and AI-powered technologies to their full potential. This is a 1-point decline from last year. Even though organizations are doing their best to leverage AI, the ROI is nowhere in the picture for many.\nAccording to an AI consultant Rider Harris, some major reasons for companies failing to reap ROIs are that they probably invested in a bad tool, they weren\u2019t trained enough (or at all), there\u2019s a lack of excitement on the fear that AI may take their job away, or there may even be a lack of resources for employees to adequately make use of or navigate those tools. \u00a0This is why focusing on aspects such as training employees, getting them excited about the AI tool, and providing adequate resources can go a long way.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity technology company harnessing artificial intelligence to streamline and strengthen cyber protection.\nOn November 20, Stifel raised the firm\u2019s price target on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) to $375 from $300 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating comes ahead of the company\u2019s Q3 earnings report, scheduled to be released on November 26. Recent checks on the company\u2019s faulty update back in July demonstrate mixed trends. However, the impact of the issue is seen to be fading, and there is growing confidence in the company\u2019s medium-term market opportunities. Despite facing legal action from Delta Airlines, there is optimism around the company\u2019s performance, with growth expectations by the second half of 2026. The company has also formed a strategic partnership with Plurilock Security Inc. to enhance protection for critical infrastructure, leveraging AI-native cybersecurity solution Falcon.\nOverall CRWD ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The SB 1047 bill in California required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them.\nHaving frequently warned that such an unrestrained development can be catastrophic for humanity, Musk was one of the 30,000 others who had signed a letter calling for a pause on the development of advanced AI technology last year.\nAccording to Tegmark, Musk could convince Trump to introduce standards that prevent the growth of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a term used for AI systems that match or surpass human levels of intelligence.\n\u201cI do think that if Elon manages to get Trump\u2019s ear on AI issues we\u2019re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI. He might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.\u201d\nBefore Trump won the elections, Musk had predicted the development of artificial intelligence that would be smarter than the smartest human being by next year or by 2026.\n\"If you define AGI (artificial general intelligence) as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably next year, within two years\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nMarket Capitalization: $84.07 billion\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity technology company that uses artificial intelligence to automate and improve cyber protection, learning from more than 2 trillion incidents every day to enhance accuracy.\nOn Monday, November 18, Truist raised the firm\u2019s price target on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) to $375 from $325 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The analyst, rating the stock as part of a broader research note previewing Q3 results for the Infrastructure & Security Software names, notes that buyer behavior has been stabilizing and the firm is focused on visibility into 2025 when generative AI projects will have a \u201crubber meets the road\u201d moment. In particular, the firm believes that Crowdstrike\u2019s recent challenges, especially its global IT outage on July 19th, may lead to lower upsell revenue. There may also be a greater-than-normal decrease in business/ revenue due to longer-than-usual subscription durations following its global IT outage.\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves right now. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This caused significant reputational damage to the cybersecurity leader, as the outage led to grounded flights, canceled medical procedures and widespread disruption. Following this incident, the stock took a sharp dive, dropping from $345 to $264 on July 22, as investors reacted to the news.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRWD.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nThe repercussions from the July 19 outage was revealed when the company reported its Q2 FY25 earnings. Despite the outage, the company managed to outperform wall-street analysts' revenue and earnings expectations, leading to a 3% stock price increase following the earnings release. However, with its Q2 FY25 earnings results, management released its lowered top-line and bottom-line guidance for the upcoming quarters. Despite this lowered guidance, the stock largely rebounded, and is now in line with the S&P 500's YTD returns. My long-term investment perspective for CrowdStrike lies on one key trend in cybersecurity: the growing demand from enterprise customers to consolidate multiple-vendor solutions onto a single platform to cut costs. Consequently, the recent macroeconomic pressures have forced enterprise customers to focus on efficiency and find ways to do more with less. Thus, this key trend remains strong and I believe CrowdStrike is well-positioned to benefit, as it provides one of the top platforms in the market at significant cost-savings.\nThe Falcon Platform: One-Stop Shop\nCrowdStrike is basically known as an endpoint protection company in the cybersecurity market, but I don't think this fully captures the scope of services that the company currently offers. In reality, it operates as a one-stop platform for enterprise cybersecurity solutions, which was a key point highlighted during its Q2 FY25 earnings presentation. While there are many competitors in the industry, no other competitor is able to offer the scope of services that CrowdStrike does. Thus, as mentioned previously, I believe that CrowdStrike is positioned well to benefit in a time where enterprises are increasingly looking to consolidate its cybersecurity infrastructure. As a result, CrowdStrike's platform is able to serve as a consolidated solution, which is difficult to compete with in the current cybersecurity landscape.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nGeorge Kurtz (CEO of CrowdStrike) pointed out that enterprise customers are focused on efficiency and reducing complexity, noting that Customers don't want to go backwards and have a patchwork of products. They are still focused on the consolidation piece and they're looking at us as one of the key consolidators in the market\". What was actually meant by this statement is evident in the fact that about 65% of the company's customers use five or more modules, 45% use six or more and 30% use seven or modules. Furthermore, among larger customers that spend over $100,000 annually on CrowdStrike's services, nearly half use eight or more modules. This highlights the depth of the consolidation in CrowdStrike's cybersecurity customer portfolio, making it significantly challenging to compete with.\nFurther, I found a research piece from Gartner that noted that 75% of enterprise customers are actively looking to decrease the number of cybersecurity vendors that they work with, further supporting the industry trend of vendor consolidation. Thus, the primary goal for enterprise customers is to increase integration and lower vendor management costs, and this shift will likely result in a handful of dominant players emerging in the market. Given CrowdStrike's early focus on consolidation through its Falcon platform, it is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.\nPost-Outage Recovery\nPost the outage on July 19, CrowdStrike experienced some disruption in its sales pipeline with a few deals placed on hold, and to be finalized in subsequent quarters. Consequently, management clarified to investors that the larger part of those delayed deals would still stay in the pipeline. That said, investors should be prepared to hear that some of the new customers are going to be more cautious than usual, since the company has lost some trust within the marketplace as a result of the outage. During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, CFO Burt Podbere noted the following: \"We expect to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, with additional scrutiny requiring higher levels of approval at the CEO and, in some cases, Board of Directors level.\" The meaning behind this is simple: the longer the list of approvals, the more protracted the sales cycle will be, especially in large corporations. Although the CFO didn't mention the exact delay periods, I expect bigger deals to take close to six months to finalize.\nTo address the situation, it appears that CrowdStrike has introduced customer commitment packages, wherein the company gives a discount and other incentives to their customers in return for signing longer-term contracts. This may, however, affect the company's revenues for the next few quarters, but it's important to note that CrowdStrike still managed to win several eight and nine-figure deals despite the outage. For example, within cloud security, CrowdStrike secured an eight-figure deal with a major enterprise software firm, which opted to standardize on Falcon Cloud Security across its entire business, replacing another next-gen cloud security vendor. Similarly, a nine-figure cloud security deal saw a large enterprise adopt Falcon Cloud Security across a million hosts, replacing other cloud security products.\nIn the Security information and event management (SIEM) market, CrowdStrike continues to outperform legacy SIEM providers. Two major deals stand out: an eight-figure deal with an existing customer, which replaced two legacy SIEMs with CrowdStrike's LogScale, resulting in over 60% cost savings, and a seven-figure deal with a leading generative AI company, which standardized on LogScale after a year of use, improving search speed, response times, and total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to their previous legacy SIEM solution.\nExpanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)\nCrowdStrike's growth story is further supported by the expanding TAM. In 2024, the TAM for cybersecurity is expected to be around $100 billion, but this figure is projected to grow to $225 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8%. Even if CrowdStrike only manages to grow in line with the market, the company has a long runway for growth. Given its platformization strategy, I believe CrowdStrike is positioned to outpace market growth and capture significant market share.\nStrong Results Despite Challenges\nCrowdStrike's Q2 FY25 results, in my view, basically showcase the company's resilience and strength, even in the face of significant adversity (with the recent outage and macro pressures). The company reported revenue of $964 million (up 31.7% YoY), overperforming wall-street guidance by $5.5 million. With 94% of its revenue coming from subscriptions, the growth in this segment is a key indicator of CrowdStrike's performance. Subscription revenue grew 33% YoY, while ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) was up 32%, reaching $3.9 billion. This included $218 million in net new ARR, an 11% increase YoY, in line with the company's guidance.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nCrowdStrike also reported record non-GAAP operating income of $227 million, representing a 46% YoY increase, signaling excellent operational efficiency. Notably, non-GAAP operating income is growing faster than revenue, demonstrating the company's operating leverage, a key strength in the tech sector, where many companies prioritize growth over profitability.\nRobust Cash Flow Generation\nFree cash flows increased by 44% YoY to $272 million in Q2 FY25, with a 28% free cash flow margin, highlighting the company's ability to fund its own growth. The company achieved what it calls the \"rule of 60\" during the quarter. This means that the sum of its YoY revenue growth rate (approximately 32%) and its free cash flow margin (28%) equals 60. The term is derived from the \"rule of 40,\" a concept introduced by Brad Feld, who describes it as the idea that a company's growth rate combined with its profitability should total at least 40%. For example, a 20% growth rate should correspond with a 20% profit margin, while a 50% growth rate could be paired with a 10% loss. Exceeding this benchmark is rare, which is why investors tend to value CrowdStrike more highly compared to other growth stocks.\nLowered Management Guidance\nAlthough the company reported great Q2 FY25 results despite the outage, the repercussions of the outage is largely reflected in CrowdStrike's full-year guidance. Management lowered its initial revenue guidance for FY25 by 1.5%, now expecting revenue to be between $3.896 billion and $3.989 billion, down from the original forecast of $3.924 billion to $3.989 billion. Non-GAAP operating income guidance was also reduced by 11.23%, with the new midpoint at $788.5 million, down from $888.3 million. While Q3 FY25 is expected to show continued revenue growth of 34.2%, non-GAAP operating income growth is forecasted to slow to 8.3%, reflecting the near-term impact of the outage on profitability.\nCapacity For Continued Investments\nI have already mentioned Crowdstrike's ability to drive impressive revenue growth and operational efficiency. But, in addition to this, the reason that I'm bullish on the company is mainly due to the fact that CrowdStrike's fundamental strengths are also backed by its commitment to reinvest back into the core business. Looking at the closest rival to CrowdStrike (Palo Alto Networks), CrowdStrike's Capex to CFO ratio is relatively higher. Although Palo Alto Networks has larger R&D capex spending in absolute terms, if CRWD sustains its impressive CFO growth, it will likely close the gap with PANW soon. CrowdStrike's top-line and CFO is growing much faster compared to rivals.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nStrong Balance Sheet\nCrowdStrike also maintains a solid balance sheet. As of Q2 FY25, the company held $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents against $743.2 million in long-term debt, giving it a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of 0.28. Furthermore, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.75 suggests that CrowdStrike can comfortably manage its debt using operating profits. Furthermore, while some competitors and investors overhyped the potential for CrowdStrike to lose business, the company's operating leverage remains on track. With its continued focus on platform consolidation, I expect CrowdStrike to maintain its leadership position and recover from the recent setbacks caused by the outage.\nValuation Thoughts\nFrom a valuation standpoint, I am quite optimistic about CrowdStrike's potential. I believe CrowdStrike is currently trading at a significant discount, especially when considering the several growth catalysts that will unfold in both the short and long term. At the moment, CrowdStrike is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23x, which is well below its five-year historical average of 29x. This disparity may suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its historical valuation, presenting a unique buying opportunity for investors. In the near term, I anticipate that CrowdStrike's stock may experience some additional drawdowns as investors reassess their positions in light of the recent outage. However, I view this as a temporary phase, which could provide a compelling entry point for those who may have missed out on the stock during its earlier growth stages.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nHistorically, CrowdStrike's P/S ratio has been considerably higher, so I expect that as the company fully recovers from the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) incident, its valuation will revert closer to the five-year average of 29x. Given these factors, I'm setting a target multiple of 27x, which would imply a price target of around $375 per share. This represents an upside of approximately 20%, which, in my opinion, provides a solid margin for investors to take advantage of at current levels.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[Alpha Spread]\nFrom a discounted cash flow (DCF) perspective, I used a discount rate of 8% (which reflects the company's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC) and applied a conservative terminal growth rate of 5%. This DCF analysis aligns with Wall Street's growth forecasts for CrowdStrike over the next five years, which reflects a topline-growth rate of 15% over the next five years and some operating leverage improvements as the company expands beyond endpoint protection and solidifies its position as a leader in platform consolidation, offering a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity services. The scalability and robustness of the Falcon platform have already been proven, supporting the optimistic outlook from analysts. Based on this DCF model, I derive an upside of roughly 19% (with a target price of $408), which I believe offers ample margin for value investors seeking to capitalize on CrowdStrike's current valuation. Given the company's strong fundamentals, its recovery potential, and the broader market opportunity, I see this as an attractive entry point for those looking to invest at these levels.\nConclusion\nDespite the recent outage and its immediate challenges, I remain confident in CrowdStrike's long-term growth potential. The company's current market position, and the strategy towards platform consolidation positions it well to capitalize on the growing trend of enterprise customers seeking to streamline their cybersecurity solutions with a single provider to save costs and improve efficiency. Even after the setback (with regards to BSOD), CrowdStrike secured significant deals, demonstrating resilience and maintaining market trust. Additionally, with its current valuation appearing attractive compared to historical averages, a robust balance sheet, and a proven ability to drive growth through its Falcon platform, I see this as a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on its recovery and long-term market potential.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 6.7% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nStory Continues\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs CRWD a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.65.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.

The company plans to announce its earnings on November 26, 2024. On that day, CrowdStrike Holdings is projected to report earnings of $0.82 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $982.26 million, up 24.97% from the prior-year quarter.\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion, indicating changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for CrowdStrike Holdings. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.47% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. CrowdStrike Holdings is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nInvestors should also note CrowdStrike Holdings's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 92.37. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 30.95 of its industry.\nWe can also see that CRWD currently has a PEG ratio of 3.28. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Internet - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.45 as of yesterday's close.\nStory Continues\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 33, which puts it in the top 14% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

          "whole_article": "Investor Alert-Could These Three Hot Tech Stocks Be About To Split\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nOwning a hot stock can enrich investors in many ways and the more shares investors own, the more money they stand to make. That's why a stock split, which multiplies the number of shares an investor owns or that an investor can buy, always makes big news. Hot tech stocks are prone to splitting when their share price gets excessively high and there is speculation these three tech stocks could be primed for a split.\nDon't Miss:\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nCrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD)\nIf you've ever surfed the web, you have likely used a website that uses CrowdStrike to keep the site secure. Since its IPO in 2019, CrowdStrike has established itself as one of the world's most recognizable cloud-based cybersecurity companies. Back then, its shares traded for only $34, but today, a share in CrowdStrike will set you back a hefty $336.\nCrowdStrike occupies a large market share, largely because it's one of the few cybersecurity companies that provide its services via cloud apps instead of directly installing applications like DVDs. This approach allows Crowdstrike's biggest clients, many of which are tech companies or have extensive Web-based operations, to keep the same service as their operations expand.\nCrowdstrike's reputation hit in the summer when it experienced a global outage that knocked some of the world's biggest tech companies offline. Despite that, the company's public filings show that CrowdStrike became profitable in 2024. More importantly, analysts expect this stock's earnings per share (EPS) to grow by over 70% by 2027. If CrowdStrike hits those targets, this stock price may shoot so high that a split becomes a strong possibility.\nTrending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% \u2014 Investors like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nMongoDB (Nasdaq: MDB)\nMongoDB manufactures database management software that allows companies more options for upscaling or customization. This flexibility lets MongoDB clients store and access their important data in the way that best suits the client instead of having to adapt to the traditional, structured method of database management offered by competing businesses.\nStory Continues\nMongoDB's IPO was in 2017 when shares in this tech company cost only $24. Today, MongoDB shares have surged to nearly $280 and its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 40% from 2018 to 2024. Although the company has yet to turn a profit, analysts at Barclays and Citigroup have recently upgraded their price targets for MongoDB to $345 and $400. If the analyst predictions are correct, MongoDB shares could be primed for a split.\nSee Also: Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.\nASML (Nasdaq: ASML)\nSemiconductors are mission-critical components in AI applications and ASML is a global leader in manufacturing lithography systems fo semiconductors superconductors. These systems work by using advanced optics to imprint circuit patterns onto microchips. This Dutch-based company counts some of the world's foremost tech companies, including Samsung and Intel as its clients.\nASML's Q3 2024 report showed a nearly 60% increase over Q3 2023 and company management predicted revenue would exceed $63 billion by 2030. This company has been around since 1995 and its stock has split four times. The last one came in 2007, but ASML's share price has jumped by nearly 1,500% to the current price of $658.63. Another bonus for ASML shareholders is that it pays a dividend of 0.098% ($6.45/share).\nConsidering this stock's previous history of splitting and its current sky-high share price, it's not hard to imagine ASML getting set for another split at some point in the future. In the meantime, analysts at JP Morgan and Wells Fargo have given ASML a \"buy now\" rating. The buy-in isn't cheap, but the prospect of earning a dividend and a future stock split makes ASML worth some attention from tech investors.\nDiversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nWhile Realty Income is undoubtedly a solid choice for investors seeking consistent monthly dividend income, it's important to remember that publicly traded stocks are subject to market volatility. For those looking to diversify their income streams and potentially reduce exposure to market fluctuations, real estate investing through platforms like Arrived is worth considering.\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio.\nThis article Investor Alert-Could These Three Hot Tech Stocks Be About To Split originally appeared on Benzinga.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 26% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE.\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CrowdStrike Holdings is:\n6.0% = US$175m \u00f7 US$2.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nCrowdStrike Holdings' Earnings Growth And 6.0% ROE\nOn the face of it, CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that CrowdStrike Holdings grew its net income at a significant rate of 28% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\nWe then compared CrowdStrike Holdings' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period.\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Past Earnings Growth November 18th 2024\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is CRWD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\nStory Continues\nIs CrowdStrike Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nGiven that CrowdStrike Holdings doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we do feel that CrowdStrike Holdings has some positive attributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp.

The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company\u2019s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.\nHowever, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern.

The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\nYet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth.

Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.\nStory Continues\nAggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind.

          "whole_article": "Investor confidence in certain major companies has propelled markets higher, but there are also those betting against big-name stocks through short selling amid continued uncertainty.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly topped the 6,000-point mark in the recent rally following Donald Trump's election win, though they have since eased back, with the main US index closing Wednesday's session flat at 5,917.\nWhile markets broadly rose following the US election, there were a particular group of stocks that rallied in what has been dubbed the \"Trump trade\", around expectations as to the policies that the Republican president-elect could look to implement after he returns to the White House in January.\nOne of which was Tesla (TSLA), as the electric carmaker's CEO Elon Musk was a major supporter of Trump's campaign and has since been nominated by the president-elect to co-lead the recently announced Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nRead more: FTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win\nThe post-election rally in Tesla stock pushed its market valuation to over the $1tn mark, which was welcome news for investors that are bullish about the company's prospects.\nHowever, not all investors were reaping the benefits, as data from S3 Partners showed that short-sellers had lost nearly $8bn by the Monday after the election, according to Business Insider.\nUnlike the traditional way of investing in markets by buying shares with the goal of selling them at a higher price, also known as going \"long\", short selling aims to make a profit on the declining price of the stock. An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.\nThe hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.\nAnd while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.\nAnalysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) in the last month.\nHere are the major companies that have become popular shorts.\nPopular short stocks\nS3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.\nStory continues\nChipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.\nThe demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.\nAt the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.\nShares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.\nAnd Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.\nRead more: Rise in UK borrowing shows Reeves has 'little wiggle room' on spending\nThe discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.\nTesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.\nHowever, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve \"slight growth\" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.\nS3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).\nFollowing its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.\nS&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this \"may be related to the [US] election\".\nThey said that despite this significant activity in \"all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses\".\nGlobal short bets\nMeanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.\nThe data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on \"crowdedness\", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors\u2019 supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.\nLVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.\nThe company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an \"uncertain economic and geopolitical environment\" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.\nRead more: FTSE 100 and European-listed stocks to own in 2025, according to Barclays\nThe luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\nKering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.\nShares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.\nMultinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.\nDiageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIt has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.\nIn South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.\nRead more: What we know about planned UK private stock market Pisces\nHindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were \"nothing but a lie\".\nOn Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.\nShares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.\nIn a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were \"baseless\".\nHindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.\nHowever, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024\nHow Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.\nOf course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\nStory Continues\nBroadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.\nOur View\nWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers\u2014critical components for Nvidia\u2019s AI-focused operations.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nA strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.\nHistorically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s during major market reactions. Nvidia\u2019s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.\nHow To Buy AVGO Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\nStory Continues\nCheck It Out:\nArrived Achieved A Total Return of 34.7% On Their Biggest Sale Yet \u2014 Diversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure.\nOnce the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months.\nNvidia (NVDA) earnings \u2014 coming after the bell Wednesday \u2014 will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday.\n\"It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,\" said Essaye. \"It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.\"\nNvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock \u2014 up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years \u2014 hit record highs following the election.\nBut many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.\nSemiconductor returns during the second half of 2024\nThe worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.\nMeanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) \u2014 seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor \u2014 is down 14%.\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTo be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday.\n\"Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],\" said Essaye.\nSince the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia \u2014 \"priced to perfection\" according to many analysts \u2014 underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.\nStory Continues\nBut Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this \"bellwether\" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.\n\"They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far,\" he said. \"I think they can do it again.\"\nmorning brief image\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.\nWhen it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there\u2019s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University\u2019s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).\nFounded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university\u2019s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard\u2019s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard\u2019s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university\u2019s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard\u2019s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.\nAccording to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. \u201cNarv\u201d Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia\u2019s 11.5% or Brown\u2019s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC\u2019s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:\n\u201cIn FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC\u2019s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.\u201d\nNotably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from \"overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500.\" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar\u2019s strategy of overhauling the university\u2019s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Harvard Management Company\u2019s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nHarvard Management Company's Stake: $89.6 million\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the world\u2019s largest technology companies, with operations spanning the hardware and software sectors. The company\u2019s primary strength is in hardware, as it supplies networking and custom chips across diverse applications.\nIn its third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and robust non-AI semiconductor sales. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI revenue to grow 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the annual AI revenue to $12 billion, largely fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOn November 6, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company\u2019s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing \u201cseasonal headwinds\u201d linked to a product transition for Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's \"easy\" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some \"serious gains.\"\n\"I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It\u2019s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don\u2019t count. But that, people, is nonsense.\"\nCramer said banks do not \"care\" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.\n\"I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I\u2019m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.\"\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks.\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nCommenting about Broadcom in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said:\n\u201cI am also pulling for Broadcom. I think Broadcom should do well. I don\u2019t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.\u201d\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market.\u00a0Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe continued to build our position in\u00a0Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The company is slated to reveal its earnings on December 12, 2024. On that day, Broadcom Inc. is projected to report earnings of $1.39 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 25.23%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $14.06 billion, indicating a 51.29% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Broadcom Inc. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 32.63.\nAlso, we should mention that AVGO has a PEG ratio of 1.63. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Semiconductors was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.72 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

          "whole_article": "Broadcom: 3 Reasons We Love This Stock\nBroadcom currently trades at $165.14 and has been a dream stock for shareholders. It\u2019s returned 431% since November 2019, blowing past the S&P 500\u2019s 87.9% gain. The company has also beaten the index over the past six months as its stock price is up 16.8%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy AVGO? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is AVGO a Good Business?\nOriginally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.\n1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Over the last five years, Broadcom grew its sales at an excellent 16% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).\nBroadcom Quarterly Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nBroadcom\u2019s management team is currently guiding for a 50.6% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect Broadcom\u2019s revenue to grow 24.6% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus its 21.6% annualized growth rate for the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and implies its newer products and services will catalyze higher growth rates.\n3. Excellent Free Cash Flow Boosts Reinvestment Potential\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nBroadcom has shown terrific cash profitability, and if sustainable, puts it in an advantageous position to invest in new products, return capital to investors, and consolidate the market during industry downturns. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the semiconductor sector, averaging an eye-popping 43.8% over the last two years.\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we think Broadcom is a great business, and with its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 28.2x forward price-to-earnings (or $165.14 per share). Is now a good time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than Broadcom\nThe elections are now behind us. With rates dropping and inflation cooling, many analysts expect a breakout market to cap off the year - and we\u2019re zeroing in on the stocks that could benefit immensely.\nTake advantage of the rebound by checking out our Top 9 Market-Beating Stocks. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like Comfort Systems (+783% five-year return).

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 points to a change of +14% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Former chip leader Intel (INTC) was kicked out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that Nvidia is part of the mix now,\u201d Jackson said, noting it could encourage purchases from retail investors.\nOne potential hiccup is the restrictions around selling to China by the Biden administration and subsequent write-downs, which were a \u201cmeaningful part of their quarterly earnings,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey had to take it down to zero.\u201d\nStory Continues\nIncoming president Donald Trump could stay firm on the chip issue as well, making good on his campaign promises around China.\n\"The good news for investors is that they\u2019ve written everything down and so if anything comes from the relationship with China and Nvidia, it\u2019s going to be great,\u201d Jackson said.\nWall Street will be hard-pressed to downgrade Nvidia's stock in the medium term.\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\nCraigslist founder is giving away $200 million to prevent cybercrimes against the US\nWhy Nvidia stock is ripe for another surge: Investor\nTrump, tariffs, and one unpredictable economy in 2025\n\u201cThe revenue monetization opportunity is so much greater [than investors appreciate],\u201d Bank of America analyst and Nvidia bull Vivek Arya said on Opening Bid.\nKey drivers for Arya's bullish Nvidia call include coming next-generation AI chips \u2014 the Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra.

While many are still bullish on further upside in the stock, we believe it's time to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the profits.\nServiceNow specializes in digital workflow automation, providing cloud-based workflow automation solutions that help organizations improve their operations. Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.\nThe company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.\nHard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage\nThe rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.\nApproximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.\nSome of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.\nOur bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft\u2019s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.\nCarahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn\u2019t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company\u2019s future relations with the government.\nIn a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.\nThis also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn\u2019t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock\u2019s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow ranks 24th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 97 hedge fund portfolios held NOW at the end of the second quarter which was 90 in the previous quarter.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:\n14% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\nTo start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.\nNYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\nStory Continues\nIs ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nCramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:\n\u201cLet's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive\u2026 Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market\u2026 Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting\u2026 Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again\u2026 Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company\u2019s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.\nOverall NOW ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance.

The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nHow ServiceNow Inc (NOW)\u2019s AI Partnerships Are Driving Its Soaring Growth: Insights from Jim Cramer\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia\u2019s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.\nThis partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.\nFor the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%. The company also expects a gross profit margin of 84.5% for its subscription services, with an operating income margin of 29.5% and a free cash flow margin of 31%.\nOverall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013November 15, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Toast TOST, as the Bull of the Day and Clean Harbors CLH, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nToast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.\nThe stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock\u2019s ongoing upward momentum.\nAbout the Company\nToast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.\nWith its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.\nIts platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.\nToast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of \u201cA\u201d in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a \u201cF\u201d in Value.\nQ3 Earnings Beat\nOn November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.\nQ3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.\nThe company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.\nGross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.\nManagement comments were overwhelmingly bullish:\n\u201cToast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.\u201d\nEstimates Headed Higher\nAnalysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.\nStory Continues\nFor the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.\nFor the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.\nFor the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.\nToast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote\nWith the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.\nJPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.\nThe Technical Take\nThe stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO\u2019d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.\nAfter trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.\nWith the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.\nPost earnings low: $36\nGap fill: $33\n21-day: $32\n50-day: $29.20\n200-day: $25.20\nFibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32\nWhile that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.\nIn Summary\nToast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.\nThe company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.\nAs Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.\nBear of the Day:\nClean Harbors \u00a0is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.\nThe company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?\nWith an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.\nAbout the Company\nClean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).\nThe company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world\u2019s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.\nCLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cD\u201d in Value, But \u201cB\u201d in both Momentum and Growth.\nQ3 Earnings\nThe company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.\nDespite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.\nPositive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.\nWhile there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.\nEarnings Estimates\nEstimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.\nFor the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.\nLooking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.\nFor the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year\u2019s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.\nTechnical Take\nThe drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.\nThis volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.\nThe drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.\nThe stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.\nIn Summary\nClean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.\nWith significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.\nAdditional content:\nServiceNow Expands Generative AI Offerings: Is the Stock a Buy?\nServiceNow\u00a0is adding Generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to the Now platform to foster responsible AI. NOW is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio, including new, expanded Now Assist capabilities with an AI Governance feature for secure and compliant AI practices.\nNOW\u2019s expanding GenAI portfolio and rich partner base have been driving top-line growth. A strong partner base, which includes the likes of Microsoft , NVIDIA and many more, is strengthening ServiceNow\u2019s AI capabilities.\nNOW and Five9 recently signed an expanded partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified end-to-end employee and customer experiences by combining ServiceNow Customer Service Management and the Five9 platform.\nNOW\u2019s prospects remain bright, with shares appreciating 48% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers \u2013 IT Services industry\u2019s returns of 30% and 15.8%, respectively.\nServiceNow shares are trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\nLet us dig deeper to find out the factors driving NOW\u2019s prospects.\nServiceNow Raises Subscription Revenue Guidance\nFor 2024, NOW expects subscription revenues of $10.655-$10.66 billion (up from previous guidance of $10.575-$10.585 billion), which suggests a rise of 23% from the 2023 actuals on a GAAP basis and 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects the non-GAAP subscription gross margin to be 84.5% and the non-GAAP operating margin to be 29.5%. The free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, subscription revenues are projected between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 21.5-22% on a GAAP basis. At cc, subscription revenues are expected to grow at 20.5%.\nCurrent Remaining Performance Obligation is expected to grow 21.5% year over year on both non-GAAP and GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% for the current quarter.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $13.87 per share, up 0.4% over the past 30 days, indicating a 28.66% year-over-year increase.\nServiceNow, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ServiceNow, Inc. Quote\nThe consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.\nStrong Portfolio Aids NOW\u2019s Prospects\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.\nServiceNow\u2019s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.\nThe Xanadu update adds the latest AI capabilities to boost customer agility, enhance productivity and improve employee experiences. It expands the GenAI portfolio to enterprise functions, including Security, and Sourcing & Procurement Operations.\nNOW plans to integrate Agentic AI into the ServiceNow platform and unlock 24/7 productivity at a massive scale. This service will be available this November for Customer Service Management AI Agents and IT Service Management AI Agents. It is expected to reduce the time to resolve an issue and make live agents more productive.\nStrong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive\nA strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nNOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.\nThe strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.\nIn third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.\nNOW\u2019s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation\nHowever, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector\u2019s 6.37X.\nWe believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow\u2019s premium valuation.\nConclusion\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.\nServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc.

          "whole_article": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in NOW?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.\nInsiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nNYSE:NOW Insider Trading Volume November 14th 2024\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of ServiceNow\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?\nInsiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:NOW) to $1,150 from $1,050 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares. According to the firm, ServiceNow is among the few companies that are demonstrating tangible AI monetization, i.e. they are really making money from AI. One of the key catalysts that will drive this momentum forward is the launch of its CSM/ITSM agents in Xanadu on November 24. The launch is a major step for the company in enhancing its AI-led customer service offerings. Finally, Wells Fargo expects ServiceNow to take the lead in AI customer service.\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?\u201d\nCramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind.
