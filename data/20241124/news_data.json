          "whole_article": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPrivate equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models.

I say that as a compliment. Nobody gets away with charging too much anymore\u2014not in this country, no matter the industry, perhaps even the drug industry. It\u2019s happening now, it\u2019s happening fast, and many companies are being left behind by the change. I see it everywhere I go\u2014in the grocery store, online, in the mall, and, of course, in the stock market.\u201d\nCramer talked about how restaurants that offer cheaper but quality meals are seeing a surge in their stock prices amid rising revenues. He also discussed how weight-loss drugs are impacting companies that sell alcohol products.\n\u201cAmerican people are tired of paying up. They feel gou, they feel betrayed, they feel that the only thing about brand loyalty is that it isn\u2019t worth a dime. They want a better deal. They\u2019ll eagerly switch lifetime habits in order to save some money because prices are up so much that you feel like an idiot if you\u2019re paying up.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about.

Cramer said he agrees with the analyst.\nStory Continues\nMichael Nathanson said the following about Meta Platforms\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0in a latest interview with CNBC:\n\u201cMeta, their core business is really getting the benefit of AI. You see it in their ad numbers; they\u2019re accelerating. Their engagement is doing really, really well, so they definitely have momentum behind their business. And they\u2019ve beat our numbers all year long.\u201d\nDespite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\nAccording to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta\u2019s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), the world\u2019s largest social network, were up this quarter, due to impressive top-line growth of 22% year-over-year and solid forward guidance. Despite its large scale, Meta continues to outgrow the broader digital advertising industry, with better AI-driven content recommendations increasing engagement in products like Instagram Reels, and AI improving ad targeting and conversion rates. Our industry checks have continued to validate advertiser adoption and satisfaction, with improvements in Reels monetization, as well as strong adoption of Advantage+, Meta\u2019s AI-driven service to allocate advertiser budgets across its content surfaces.\nOverall, META ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's latest stock picks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

These announcements have served to bolster the hype around companies that build data centers. For example, Crusoe Energy, a startup building data centers for large AI firms, plans to raise more than $800 million in funding, per regulatory filings. The filings detail that the company has already raised close to $685 million of the $818 million in total that it is seeking, with seventy investors contributing to the funding.

McKinsey analysis suggests that demand for AI-ready data center capacity will rise at an average rate of 33% a year between 2023 and 2030 in a midrange scenario. Per the consulting firm, this means that around 70% of total demand for data center capacity will be for data centers equipped to host advanced-AI workloads by 2030. Gen AI, currently the fastest-growing advanced-AI use case, will account for around 40 percent of the total, the report underlines.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

In this piece, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks on the list.\nWith the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least.\nNaturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled \u2018Global Strategy Paper No. 71,\u00a0 the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This \u2018concentration\u2019 refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence.\nSince the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos\u2019 eCommerce company, and the world\u2019s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns.\nAs per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index \u201cby an annualized 200 bp-800 bp\u201d over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today\u2019s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI\u2019s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang\u2019s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade.\nGS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market\u2019s performance of the two indexes before the bubble\u2019s \u2018pop\u2019 to point out that \u201cthe trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).\u201d This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall \u201chas been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.\u201d\nStory Continues\nLinking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this \u201cextreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.\u201d Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then \u201cthis would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.\u201d\nWhile stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk\u2019s car company record stunning gains. Goldman\u2019s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that \u201cthe biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.\u201d He shared that \u201cany sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.\u201d These include \u201cenergy, traditional energy versus renewables\u201d with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%.\nTuteja added that \u201cthe resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election\u201d was a standout from the market\u2019s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that \u201cwhat I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.\u201d This is because \u201cit takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.\u201d According to him, in 2016, \u201cregional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.\u201d Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that \u201cunder the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime\u2019s policies.\u201d\nFor some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now.\nWithin this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024\u2019s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings \u201cgrowth alone can explain 40% of next quarter\u2019s cash spending growth.\u201d\nJust like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the \u201ctypical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.\u201d Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects \u201ccash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,\u201d but cautions that \u201cthe potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 top growth investment stocks, we used the bank\u2019s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm\u2019s cash flow from operations.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA financial analyst in their office, monitoring the daily performance of the stock market.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nGrowth Investment Ratio: 83%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the world\u2019s biggest social media company. Courtesy of its social media network Facebook, the firm can boast about having a whopping 3.2 billion users under its wing. This massive user base is also at the center of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s hypothesis. It makes the firm indispensable to advertisers who have no choice but to run ads on its platform if they want to capture sizable users. The scale has enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to amass significant resources, as evident through its $156 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue and $43.9 billion in cash and equivalent. The firm has used these to create a foothold in the AI industry by developing the Llama foundational AI model. Unlike other big tech players which are gearing their AI products towards cloud computing, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is targeting everyday consumers and advertisers on its platform. The billions it has invested in AI means that investors are on the watch-out for profit generation.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMeta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks 26th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by Meta Platforms Inc., leaving it to face a multibillion-dollar lawsuit that accuses the company of misleading shareholders about the data-harvesting scandal involving political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future\nNYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge\nIn Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women\u2019s Sports Takes the Field\nNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes\nTokyo\u2019s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\nInvestors claim the company, then known as Facebook, inflated share prices through misleading disclosures about the risk of the scandal leading to the misuse of user data. The shareholders say revelations about the breach eventually contributed to two 2018 price drops that cost the company more than $200 billion in market value.\nMeta was seeking reversal of a federal appeals court decision that had let the lawsuit go forward. The Supreme Court agreed to consider the appeal in June and heard arguments on Nov. 6.\nThe court occasionally drops cases after argument. As is its usual practice, the court provided no explanation, saying only that the case was being \u201cdismissed as improvidently granted.\u201d\nThe dismissal makes it more likely Meta will face a costly settlement \u2014 potentially as large as $2 billion \u2014 according to Matthew Schettenhelm, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. A Meta victory at the Supreme Court would have knocked out some though not all of the case against the company.\n\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,\u201d Meta said in a statement. \u201cWe are disappointed in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to clarify this part of the law.\u201d\nThe attorney for the investors, Kevin Russell, declined to comment.\nThe case more broadly had the potential to reset the legal rules governing corporate disclosure. Business groups led by the Chamber of Commerce had urged the court to side with Meta, saying that risk-disclosure allegations have contributed to a wave of meritless securities-fraud suits.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission since 2005 has required companies to disclose material factors that would make an investment risky.\nThe Supreme Court is also considering an appeal by AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp., which is being sued for allegedly misleading shareholders about its reliance on crypto-mining revenue in the run-up to a market crash.\nStory Continues\nCambridge Analytica\nThe first hint of the Cambridge Analytica controversy came in December 2015, when The Guardian reported that the British firm was using a database of information gleaned from Facebook users to help the presidential primary campaign of Senator Ted Cruz. At the time, Facebook said it was investigating.\nThe suing shareholders say Facebook quickly concluded that Cambridge Analytica had obtained the private information of more than 30 million users without their consent.\nBut the shareholders say the company publicly characterized the risk of a breach as hypothetical and didn\u2019t change that stance until March 2018, when it issued a statement to preempt more far-reaching stories in The New York Times and The Guardian. The investors say those revelations caused the share price to plunge.\nThe shareholders say the company\u2019s inadequate disclosures also contributed to a July 2018 stock plunge that at the time was the largest one-day drop in value in US history.\nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the allegations were sufficient to let the lawsuit go forward.\nMeta said it had no reason to think the scandal would harm the company because details had already been published without any impact on the stock price. Meta said the 9th Circuit\u2019s reasoning would require companies to disclose risks that occurred years earlier even if they don\u2019t pose any known current threat of business harm.\nThe Biden administration backed the shareholders at the Supreme Court.\nThe case is Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, 23-980.\n(Updates with analyst, Meta reaction starting in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nClear\u2019s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nAn Airline\u2019s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare\nDon\u2019t Get Out of the Points Game, Says the Points Guy\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "By John Kruzel\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court sidestepped on Friday a decision on whether to allow shareholders to proceed with a securities fraud lawsuit accusing Meta's Facebook of misleading investors about the misuse of the social media platform's user data.\nThe justices, who heard arguments in the case on Nov. 6, dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court's ruling that allowed a 2018 class action led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed. The Supreme Court opted not to resolve the underlying legal dispute, determining that the case should not have been taken up. Its action leaves the lower court's decision in place.\nThe court's dismissal came in a one-line order that provided no explanation.\nThe Facebook dispute was one of two cases to come before the Supreme Court this month involving the right of private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud. The other one, involving the artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, was argued on Nov. 13. The Supreme Court has not ruled yet in the Nvidia case.\nThe plaintiffs in the Facebook case claimed the company unlawfully withheld information from investors about a 2015 data breach involving British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica that affected more than 30 million Facebook users. They accused Facebook of misleading investors in violation of the Securities Exchange Act, a 1934 federal law that requires publicly traded companies to disclose their business risks.\nFacebook's stock fell following 2018 media reports that Cambridge Analytica had used improperly harvested Facebook user data in connection with Donald Trump's successful U.S. presidential campaign in 2016. The investors have sought unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Facebook stock they held.\nAt issue was whether Facebook broke the law when it failed to detail the prior data breach in subsequent business-risk disclosures, and instead portrayed the risk of such incidents as purely hypothetical.\nFacebook spokesperson Andy Stone expressed disappointment \"in the Supreme Court's decision not to clarify this part of the law.\"\n\"The plaintiff's claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,\" Stone said.\nFacebook argued that it was not required to reveal that its warned-of risk had already materialized because \"a reasonable investor\" would understand risk disclosures to be forward-looking statements.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration supported the shareholders in the case.\nStory Continues\nU.S. District Judge Edward Davila dismissed the lawsuit but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived it, prompting Facebook's appeal to the Supreme Court.\nGeorge Washington University law professor Alan Morrison said that following the Supreme Court's dismissal of Facebook's appeal, the plaintiffs would be expected to seek discovery, a process that involves the exchange of information among parties in a case. Morrison added that Facebook \"might renew their motion to dismiss under a somewhat different standard - partially for purposes of delay.\"\nThe Cambridge Analytica data breach prompted U.S. government investigations into Facebook's privacy practices, various lawsuits and a U.S. congressional hearing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 brought an enforcement action against Facebook over the matter, which the company settled for $100 million. Facebook paid a separate $5 billion penalty to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the issue.\nThe Supreme Court in prior rulings has limited the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that polices securities fraud.\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\nWarren Buffett has cemented his legacy as Wall Street\u2019s most successful investor. During the high-flying stock market of the 1960s, he leveraged his investment partnership to acquire\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling New England textile company at the time. Today, the firm is a vastly different entity, boasting a diverse range of businesses from Geico insurance to BNSF Railway, an equity portfolio exceeding $266 billion, and an enormous cash reserve of $325.2 billion. Decades of strong returns have built Buffett\u2019s unmatched track record. Since he took over in 1965, the company\u2019s shares have delivered an annualized gain of 19.8%.\nBuffett has famously stated that his ideal holding period for a stock is \u201cforever\u201d. True to his word, the Oracle of Omaha has held onto some of his favorite stocks for the long haul, allowing them to deliver steady share performance and generate passive income for his portfolio over time. Moreover, market analysts and investors alike have consistently praised Buffett\u2019s disciplined, long-term approach to investing, more so now that his firm has become the latest non-tech firm to surpass a $1 trillion market cap, highlighting Buffett\u2019s stock-picking abilities.\nHowever, despite strong market performance through much of 2024, Buffett seems to have adopted a more defensive stance. Concerned about inflated valuations amid high interest rates and worsening economic conditions, he has offloaded significant holdings in companies whose valuations have surged too high. Billionaire investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital echoed this in his hedge fund\u2019s quarterly letter, noting Buffett\u2019s cautious approach:\n\u201cOne could argue that sitting out bear markets has been the underappreciated reason for his outstanding long-term returns. It is therefore noteworthy to observe that Mr. Buffett is again selling large swaths of his stock portfolio and building enormous cash reserves.\u201d\nOver the past two years, Buffett has been an active net seller of stocks. His firm offloaded a total of $36.1 billion in stocks during the third quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter in which Berkshire was a net seller of equities. At the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett mentioned the possibility of a future rise in the corporate tax rate.\nMoreover, in his 2023 letter, Buffett also addresses common questions about Berkshire, including whether the company can continue to achieve the same level of outperformance as in the past:\nStory Continues\n\u201cThere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can\u2019t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance. Nevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive side, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Apple Inc. (AAPL) Still a Key Fixture in Warren Buffett\u2019s Portfolio?\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a global leader in consumer electronics has been a key fixture in Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio for several years. However, recent filings from Berkshire Hathaway revealed that the firm sold approximately $14.34 billion worth of Apple shares in Q3 2024. Despite this, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains Buffett\u2019s top holding, valued at almost $70 billion.\nIn Q3 of FY24, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered one of its best performances in recent years, setting a June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, marking a 5% year-over-year increase. Product revenue grew 2% to $61.8 billion, fueled by the launch of the iPad Pro and iPad Air. Additionally, services revenue hit an all-time high of $24.2 billion, a 14% rise from the previous year.\nOn October 23, UBS reaffirmed its Neutral rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), keeping the price target at $236. The analyst projected that Apple\u2019s September revenue and earnings per share would likely align with their estimates of $94 billion and $1.58, respectively. The iPad segment, though not the primary focus for investors, could deliver a positive surprise.\nDespite the excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) following Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), iPhone sales for the September quarter remained steady, with about 46 million units sold year over year. Factoring in an additional 5 million units for iPhone channel fill, the total forecast for iPhone sales reaches 51 million units, with revenue from iPhones estimated at $45.7 billion.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cYou probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire\u2019s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett\u2019s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire\u2019s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\u201d\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

          "last_p": "The space economy is poised for a surge in growth and development that will be fueled by deregulation and enhanced US defense spending, but the disruptive effects of Starship, as well as SpaceX\u2019s growing influence over federal policy, will have far-reaching impacts across many space industries.",
          "whole_article": "2025 could prove to be one of the most transformative years on record for the space economy.\nBetween Elon Musk\u2019s close ties with the incoming president, a new administration that is expected to be strongly pro-growth and anti-regulation, and the emergence of Starship, a rapidly reusable rocket that will shake up all the givens of accessing orbit, we are on the verge of significant changes that accelerate the growth of the space economy.\nThere are pros and cons to these upcoming changes. On the one hand, a more pro-growth administration will reduce and simplify the abundance of federal and local regulations that hamper new launch and development efforts and increase the costs for businesses. It could also lead to even more privatization of US space operations and greater federal funding support for space companies developing dual-use technologies. On the other hand, strong deregulation could prioritize growth over environmental protections. It could also pose challenges to the Earth observation sector and other climate monitoring technology.\nAnother key question is how much more dominant will SpaceX become in the next four years? The company is already the apex player in launch (the modern space economy wouldn\u2019t even exist without the Falcon 9), so will its few competitors be innovative and strategic enough to keep up with the major growth that is coming?\nMusk\u2019s close ties to the president-elect are only part of the equation here. The arrival of Starship will have a monumental impact on the space economy by accelerating growth in existing markets, enabling entirely new industries, and making existing infrastructure obsolete.\nAs we look ahead, here are 10 predictions for the space capital markets in 2025.\nSpaceX's mega rocket Starship lifts off for a test flight from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n1. The next four years\nUnder the new administration, expect an even greater focus on promoting the space economy and on commercial space integration into government programs. Given Musk\u2019s role in the administration and as one of the largest donors of the campaign, SpaceX will be the greatest beneficiary, but others will benefit as well, most notably from a light-touch regulatory regime for novel space activities overseen by the Commerce.\n2. Starship comes online\nStarship will reach orbit and begin operational flights in the first half of 2025, carrying Starlink V2 satellites. With its rapidly accelerating test program reaching a nearly monthly launch cadence in 2024, Starship will double its flight rate in 2025, aided by less regulatory resistance from the FAA, which Musk will have influence over in his new role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\nStory Continues\nThis vehicle will usher in the next phase of the space economy by significantly reducing the cost and complexity of payload missions; opening the door to crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, as well as lunar development; and setting the stage for emerging industries ranging from orbital habitats and manufacturing platforms to point-to-point travel and extended stay tourism in orbit and beyond.\n3. Mars or bust\nExpect an acceleration of plans for a crewed landing on Mars using primarily SpaceX/Starship architecture, unlike the more complicated NASA-led architecture for Artemis. Support for Artemis will likely continue but will be accompanied by a major review and reconsideration of architecture.\nFor example, a significant number of major programs, such as SLS, Orion, and ML2 are over budget, behind schedule, and/or otherwise troubled. However, any changes to SLS would likely cause domestic headaches, particularly at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., which supports 24,000 jobs and manages the SLS program. Additionally, the Gateway was designed to accommodate international collaboration in the Artemis program but with an America-first approach, and this approach could find less support.\n4. More competition for SpaceX despite a direct line to the White House\nAlthough SpaceX holds a dominant position in launch and satellite internet, 2025 will see competition emerge from several key players. Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) Project Kuiper will begin operations next year, which poses the single greatest threat to Starlink\u2019s market dominance. Direct-to-device connectivity will come online in 2025, with Starlink V2 and Apple (AAPL) moving to improve space-based communications for iPhones with a $1.7 billion investment in GlobalStar and AST SpaceMobile delivering for telecom partners like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ).\nStarlink will also see increased global competition from the Chinese G60/Thousand Sails constellation, which will see half of its first phase launched in 2025. New launch vehicles will also come online next year, including Rocket Lab\u2019s (RKLB) Neutron and Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn. These will pose a direct challenge to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, although Starship is poised to move the goalposts and supersede them.\n5. Space Superiority\nGeopolitical strains continue to fuel an increase in US Defense spending, with benefits for the US Space Force (USSF), which will be accelerated under the new administration. We expect this to show up most clearly in Resilient Global Positioning Systems (R-GPS) and Alternative Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (AltPNT) as conflicts continue and China\u2019s BeiDou continues to displace GPS in aligned countries.\nThrough Starshield, the USSF will increasingly rely on SpaceX for national security missions across GPS, geospatial intelligence, satellite communications (SatCom), space domain awareness, in-space transportation, and more. The establishment of a Space National Guard is inevitable under the new administration and will further expand public-commercial alliances and technology integrations.\n6. Incumbents adjust to the new world order\nIn 2025, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (AIR.PA) will sell off their space businesses after failing to keep up with the pace of change. These divestitures by entrenched government contractors mark a pivotal moment in the space economy, as it changes the competitive landscape, establishes a new power broker system, and creates new opportunities and risks in the government\u2019s extended capabilities in space.\nMeanwhile, expect an acceleration in SatCom M&A as leading incumbents \u2014 such as SES (SES) and Intelsat (combined in 2024), DirectTV and Dish (2024), Viasat and Inmarsat (2023), Eutelsat and OneWeb (2023) \u2014 push for greater consolidation to better compete with Starlink and other new non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) entrants.\n7. Connecting the digital and physical worlds\nOver the next year, artificial intelligence will continue to transform capabilities across the space economy, but it will be most prevalent in \u201cspatial intelligence\u201d as it facilitates the integration of geospatial data into Big Tech.\nThe successful integration of MapBox with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT search is just one early example of the possibilities evolving in this marketplace. World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, has raised $230 million to develop spatially intelligent large world models (LWMs) that can understand and reason about the 3D world from images and other modalities.\nCompanies are already in a race to automate systems that enable proliferated architecture, and AI is the only real solution to the bottleneck. Expect these efforts to accelerate dramatically in 2025, particularly due to stronger federal support for Big Tech and AI innovation as the next administration looks to increase its lead over China.\n8. Coordination of orbital traffic goes from elective to essential\nWhile China has launched a lot of rockets to date, it still only comprises a small percentage of the total global mass to orbit. Expect that to change in 2025 as Chinese mega-constellations like G60, Geely, and more begin to launch in earnest. The exponential growth in satellites in orbit (currently faster than Moore\u2019s Law) will force the conversation of coordination despite geopolitical tensions.\nDue to the US government\u2019s restrictions on direct collaboration with China, these efforts will be led by private industry. This will create a new wave of privatization in space traffic coordination and there is a strong probability that the Commerce Department\u2019s Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS) program will either be canceled or significantly restructured to emphasize commercial data.\n9. Political climate\nUnder the next administration, the US is about to make a sharp turn on climate policy, which will have negative impacts on certain environmental protections and new efforts by geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) companies to improve climate monitoring and solutions.\nThe biggest risks for the GEOINT industry are a reduction in federal funding and specific programs, like NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and NOAA\u2019s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) programs, as well as an overall challenge (and perhaps dismantling) of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incentives for businesses and investors.\nAt the same time, extreme weather events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires will become increasingly frequent, impacting more people and further straining insurance markets. Private capital will have to step up to continue to fund energy transition and climate projects, like MethaneSAT and FireSAT, in an effort to fill the gap left by cuts in climate change and civil Earth observation programs by the new administration.\nHurricane Milton is seen off the coast of Yucatan Peninsula on Oct. 8, 2024, from the International Space Station as it orbited 257 miles above. (NASA via Getty Images) \u00b7 NASA via Getty Images\n10. Play stations\nWhoever buys Boeing\u2019s International Space Station (ISS) operations business will continue their push for an extension of the ISS beyond 2030. Meanwhile, Vast will launch its Haven station in 2025, providing an exit option for a government program that is underfunded and unwanted. The current administration has already been rethinking its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program (CLD), and that skepticism is likely to intensify in the next administration.\nThe reality is that space stations are extremely costly and difficult to maintain, and Starship provides an effective alternative that checks a number of key boxes: It's less expensive, easier and faster to launch and become operational, and you can have multiple stations for less than the cost of one ISS today. Between the practicality of Starship and Musk\u2019s influence in the White House, there is a strong possibility that space stations will become another SpaceX domain.\nWhile the last decade has seen remarkable progress in the space economy, the next four years will experience many dramatic changes \u2014 beginning with a rapid phaseout of incumbents and new political priorities in 2025.\nThe space economy is poised for a surge in growth and development that will be fueled by deregulation and enhanced US defense spending, but the disruptive effects of Starship, as well as SpaceX\u2019s growing influence over federal policy, will have far-reaching impacts across many space industries.\nChad Anderson is the managing partner of Space Capital and an investor in SpaceX, along with dozens of other space companies. Between 2019 and 2021, Anderson went to the White House on a quarterly basis to provide data on the space economy, and he also joined National Space Council meetings, so he has insights on how the next administration will move forward on space.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\nView our latest analysis for Apple\nApple Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nIn fact, the recent sale by Arthur Levinson was the biggest sale of Apple shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$230). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 4.5% of Arthur Levinson's stake.\nApple insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

(Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nApple Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Apple. In total, insiders sold US$46m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nInsider Ownership\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Apple insiders own 0.06% of the company, currently worth about US$2.1b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Apple Insiders?\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPrivate equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "first_p": "2025 could prove to be one of the most transformative years on record for the space economy.",
          "last_p": "The space economy is poised for a surge in growth and development that will be fueled by deregulation and enhanced US defense spending, but the disruptive effects of Starship, as well as SpaceX\u2019s growing influence over federal policy, will have far-reaching impacts across many space industries.",
          "whole_article": "2025 could prove to be one of the most transformative years on record for the space economy.\nBetween Elon Musk\u2019s close ties with the incoming president, a new administration that is expected to be strongly pro-growth and anti-regulation, and the emergence of Starship, a rapidly reusable rocket that will shake up all the givens of accessing orbit, we are on the verge of significant changes that accelerate the growth of the space economy.\nThere are pros and cons to these upcoming changes. On the one hand, a more pro-growth administration will reduce and simplify the abundance of federal and local regulations that hamper new launch and development efforts and increase the costs for businesses. It could also lead to even more privatization of US space operations and greater federal funding support for space companies developing dual-use technologies. On the other hand, strong deregulation could prioritize growth over environmental protections. It could also pose challenges to the Earth observation sector and other climate monitoring technology.\nAnother key question is how much more dominant will SpaceX become in the next four years? The company is already the apex player in launch (the modern space economy wouldn\u2019t even exist without the Falcon 9), so will its few competitors be innovative and strategic enough to keep up with the major growth that is coming?\nMusk\u2019s close ties to the president-elect are only part of the equation here. The arrival of Starship will have a monumental impact on the space economy by accelerating growth in existing markets, enabling entirely new industries, and making existing infrastructure obsolete.\nAs we look ahead, here are 10 predictions for the space capital markets in 2025.\nSpaceX's mega rocket Starship lifts off for a test flight from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n1. The next four years\nUnder the new administration, expect an even greater focus on promoting the space economy and on commercial space integration into government programs. Given Musk\u2019s role in the administration and as one of the largest donors of the campaign, SpaceX will be the greatest beneficiary, but others will benefit as well, most notably from a light-touch regulatory regime for novel space activities overseen by the Commerce.\n2. Starship comes online\nStarship will reach orbit and begin operational flights in the first half of 2025, carrying Starlink V2 satellites. With its rapidly accelerating test program reaching a nearly monthly launch cadence in 2024, Starship will double its flight rate in 2025, aided by less regulatory resistance from the FAA, which Musk will have influence over in his new role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\nStory Continues\nThis vehicle will usher in the next phase of the space economy by significantly reducing the cost and complexity of payload missions; opening the door to crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, as well as lunar development; and setting the stage for emerging industries ranging from orbital habitats and manufacturing platforms to point-to-point travel and extended stay tourism in orbit and beyond.\n3. Mars or bust\nExpect an acceleration of plans for a crewed landing on Mars using primarily SpaceX/Starship architecture, unlike the more complicated NASA-led architecture for Artemis. Support for Artemis will likely continue but will be accompanied by a major review and reconsideration of architecture.\nFor example, a significant number of major programs, such as SLS, Orion, and ML2 are over budget, behind schedule, and/or otherwise troubled. However, any changes to SLS would likely cause domestic headaches, particularly at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., which supports 24,000 jobs and manages the SLS program. Additionally, the Gateway was designed to accommodate international collaboration in the Artemis program but with an America-first approach, and this approach could find less support.\n4. More competition for SpaceX despite a direct line to the White House\nAlthough SpaceX holds a dominant position in launch and satellite internet, 2025 will see competition emerge from several key players. Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) Project Kuiper will begin operations next year, which poses the single greatest threat to Starlink\u2019s market dominance. Direct-to-device connectivity will come online in 2025, with Starlink V2 and Apple (AAPL) moving to improve space-based communications for iPhones with a $1.7 billion investment in GlobalStar and AST SpaceMobile delivering for telecom partners like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ).\nStarlink will also see increased global competition from the Chinese G60/Thousand Sails constellation, which will see half of its first phase launched in 2025. New launch vehicles will also come online next year, including Rocket Lab\u2019s (RKLB) Neutron and Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn. These will pose a direct challenge to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, although Starship is poised to move the goalposts and supersede them.\n5. Space Superiority\nGeopolitical strains continue to fuel an increase in US Defense spending, with benefits for the US Space Force (USSF), which will be accelerated under the new administration. We expect this to show up most clearly in Resilient Global Positioning Systems (R-GPS) and Alternative Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (AltPNT) as conflicts continue and China\u2019s BeiDou continues to displace GPS in aligned countries.\nThrough Starshield, the USSF will increasingly rely on SpaceX for national security missions across GPS, geospatial intelligence, satellite communications (SatCom), space domain awareness, in-space transportation, and more. The establishment of a Space National Guard is inevitable under the new administration and will further expand public-commercial alliances and technology integrations.\n6. Incumbents adjust to the new world order\nIn 2025, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (AIR.PA) will sell off their space businesses after failing to keep up with the pace of change. These divestitures by entrenched government contractors mark a pivotal moment in the space economy, as it changes the competitive landscape, establishes a new power broker system, and creates new opportunities and risks in the government\u2019s extended capabilities in space.\nMeanwhile, expect an acceleration in SatCom M&A as leading incumbents \u2014 such as SES (SES) and Intelsat (combined in 2024), DirectTV and Dish (2024), Viasat and Inmarsat (2023), Eutelsat and OneWeb (2023) \u2014 push for greater consolidation to better compete with Starlink and other new non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) entrants.\n7. Connecting the digital and physical worlds\nOver the next year, artificial intelligence will continue to transform capabilities across the space economy, but it will be most prevalent in \u201cspatial intelligence\u201d as it facilitates the integration of geospatial data into Big Tech.\nThe successful integration of MapBox with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT search is just one early example of the possibilities evolving in this marketplace. World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, has raised $230 million to develop spatially intelligent large world models (LWMs) that can understand and reason about the 3D world from images and other modalities.\nCompanies are already in a race to automate systems that enable proliferated architecture, and AI is the only real solution to the bottleneck. Expect these efforts to accelerate dramatically in 2025, particularly due to stronger federal support for Big Tech and AI innovation as the next administration looks to increase its lead over China.\n8. Coordination of orbital traffic goes from elective to essential\nWhile China has launched a lot of rockets to date, it still only comprises a small percentage of the total global mass to orbit. Expect that to change in 2025 as Chinese mega-constellations like G60, Geely, and more begin to launch in earnest. The exponential growth in satellites in orbit (currently faster than Moore\u2019s Law) will force the conversation of coordination despite geopolitical tensions.\nDue to the US government\u2019s restrictions on direct collaboration with China, these efforts will be led by private industry. This will create a new wave of privatization in space traffic coordination and there is a strong probability that the Commerce Department\u2019s Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS) program will either be canceled or significantly restructured to emphasize commercial data.\n9. Political climate\nUnder the next administration, the US is about to make a sharp turn on climate policy, which will have negative impacts on certain environmental protections and new efforts by geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) companies to improve climate monitoring and solutions.\nThe biggest risks for the GEOINT industry are a reduction in federal funding and specific programs, like NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and NOAA\u2019s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) programs, as well as an overall challenge (and perhaps dismantling) of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incentives for businesses and investors.\nAt the same time, extreme weather events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires will become increasingly frequent, impacting more people and further straining insurance markets. Private capital will have to step up to continue to fund energy transition and climate projects, like MethaneSAT and FireSAT, in an effort to fill the gap left by cuts in climate change and civil Earth observation programs by the new administration.\nHurricane Milton is seen off the coast of Yucatan Peninsula on Oct. 8, 2024, from the International Space Station as it orbited 257 miles above.

Play stations\nWhoever buys Boeing\u2019s International Space Station (ISS) operations business will continue their push for an extension of the ISS beyond 2030. Meanwhile, Vast will launch its Haven station in 2025, providing an exit option for a government program that is underfunded and unwanted. The current administration has already been rethinking its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program (CLD), and that skepticism is likely to intensify in the next administration.\nThe reality is that space stations are extremely costly and difficult to maintain, and Starship provides an effective alternative that checks a number of key boxes: It's less expensive, easier and faster to launch and become operational, and you can have multiple stations for less than the cost of one ISS today. Between the practicality of Starship and Musk\u2019s influence in the White House, there is a strong possibility that space stations will become another SpaceX domain.\nWhile the last decade has seen remarkable progress in the space economy, the next four years will experience many dramatic changes \u2014 beginning with a rapid phaseout of incumbents and new political priorities in 2025.\nThe space economy is poised for a surge in growth and development that will be fueled by deregulation and enhanced US defense spending, but the disruptive effects of Starship, as well as SpaceX\u2019s growing influence over federal policy, will have far-reaching impacts across many space industries.\nChad Anderson is the managing partner of Space Capital and an investor in SpaceX, along with dozens of other space companies. Between 2019 and 2021, Anderson went to the White House on a quarterly basis to provide data on the space economy, and he also joined National Space Council meetings, so he has insights on how the next administration will move forward on space.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.\nStory Continues\nLast week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.\nNetflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyonc\u00e9 will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.\nThe company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nJefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a \"breakthrough\" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.\nBofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, \"Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.\"\nNetflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.\nStill, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat \u2014 a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.\n\"With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.\nValuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock \"is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025.\" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

These companies have millions of digital customers\u2014and billions of interactions with them. They are using the insights from this data to rapidly optimize each customer\u2019s next experience.\nIn the age of artificial intelligence, competitive advantage is increasingly determined by a company's ability to deliver personalized experiences at scale. We call this phenomenon the \u201cpersonalization advantage,\u201d which can be expressed by a simple formula:\nP = n \u00d7 v2\nP represents the competitive advantage of personalization.\nN is the volume of interactions from which the company can learn.\nV is the speed of learning, which has an exponential impact.\nThe Personalization Advantage formula illustrates why these companies are winning: they have both scale (n) in terms of customer interactions and speed (v) in learning from and acting on these interactions.\nPersonalization is not just customization\u2014it\u2019s about using customer data to deliver experiences tailored in real-time, evolving with each interaction. Whether it's a website suggesting products you didn't know you needed based on prior behavior, a call center agent knowing your shopping history with the company, or a sales associate remembering your preferences, the key is scaling these interactions across millions of customers and constantly learning from them.\nPersonalization is creating experiences at scale that get fine-tuned with each successive interaction, empowering customers to get what they want better, faster, cheaper, or more easily. The difference lies in the way personalized communications build on everything the company learns about the customer over time, and about how other customers like them behave. In our experience across industries and consumer contexts, this is what makes personalization truly effective. This effectiveness is directly linked to the Personalization Advantage formula. The more interactions a company has (n), and the faster it can learn from them (v), the greater its personalization advantage (P) becomes.\nIt is enabled by the many different forms of AI available: machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and others, often combined together. Business is now effectively at the point where competitive advantage will be based on a company\u2019s ability to relentlessly capture, analyze, and utilize customer data, at a massive scale, with every possible contact\u2014and on how it uses that data to understand, shape, personalize, and optimize each customer\u2019s journey.\nStory Continues\nBuilding economies of scale has always been important in business, especially in the physical aspects of competition: supply chains, production, and distribution. However, personalization changes the nature of scale in the customer experience from the mass production of goods to the mass delivery of 1:1 experiences built on accumulated intelligence. Personalization at scale, and the ongoing cycle of experimentation and learning that power it, create a competitive moat that is very hard to replicate. This competitive moat is precisely what our Personalization Advantage formula quantifies.\nIt\u2019s about scale (n)\nCompanies such as Alipay, Amazon, Tencent, Flipkart, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify have each amassed over 200 million active users. The sheer size of their digital customer base is enormous. They distill insights about these users not just when they transact, but every time they browse or click in a digital channel. But even non-digital native companies are maximizing the \u201csurface area\u201d they have for gathering and using customer information\u2014like an alarm company understanding how homeowners use their touchpads or B2B distributors tracking the frequency and nature of replenishment orders.\nThese companies even know the lifetime value of each new active user they add\u2014and invest accordingly. For example, a large food and beverage company we\u2019ve worked with estimated that each 10 million new digital customer relationships would add $1 billion in incremental revenue.\nIt\u2019s about speed (v)\nUltimately, personalization is about what companies do with the insights about their customers. This is where companies are competing on speed. Speed in getting to know the customer throughout the customer journey, speed in executing based on a trigger about a customer, and speed in constantly improving the experience based on that knowledge. We are big believers in the importance of \u201ctime-based competition,\u201d the concept of competing on the basis of speed. In personalization, it is foundational.\nThe squared term in our formula (v2) emphasizes the outsized impact of speed. Doubling the speed of learning and execution more than doubles the personalization advantage.\nIt is no coincidence that companies across a wide swath of categories, including home improvement, banking, restaurants, grocery, and apparel have publicly announced that personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences are central to their corporate strategy. These companies understand that maximizing both (n) and (v) in the Personalization Advantage formula is crucial for their success.\nBy studying hundreds of personalization leaders over the past decade, we have even quantified the size of the personalization advantage pioneering companies are capturing in terms of growth. Across industries, we find that personalization leaders consistently outgrow laggards. In fact, leaders grow top-line revenues 10 points faster per year than laggards. Taken together, we estimate that by the end of this decade, the personalization leaders, on a combined basis, will capture almost $2 trillion in incremental growth.\nThe basis of competition has shifted\u2014and the prize for those that rethink their business model accordingly is enormous. But here\u2019s the catch. Our research also finds that only 10% of companies qualify as personalization leaders. Many businesses say they are doing personalization but fail to go beyond basic segmented marketing. They end up sending more spam, generating more calls from complaining customers, and frustrating themselves with slower growth than expected. These laggards are failing to optimize both (n) and (v) in the personalization advantage formula, limiting their growth potential.\nMore must-read\u00a0commentary\u00a0published by\u00a0Fortune:\nShell\u2019s Pyrrhic victory may well set the stage for more corporate climate accountability\nDemis Hassabis-James Manyika: AI will help us understand the very fabric of reality\nI worked with Steve Jobs.

          "whole_article": "Netflix's NFLX transformation from a DVD rental service to a streaming giant is taking another significant leap with its ambitious push into live content. The company's recent successes with events like the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match, which drew 108 million average viewers, demonstrate its potential in the live streaming arena. However, technical challenges during these events raise questions about the platform's readiness for major live programming.\nTechnical Infrastructure Concerns\nNetflix's strategic expansion into live streaming, marked by high-profile events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the $5 billion WWE deal, demonstrates its commitment to diversifying content offerings beyond traditional streaming. However, widespread streaming issues and buffering problems plagued many viewers. These technical difficulties are particularly concerning as the company prepares for even bigger events, including two NFL Christmas Day games and the upcoming launch of WWE's Monday Night Raw in 2025.\n\nThe platform's ability to handle large-scale concurrent streaming remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed. Despite these short-term hurdles, Netflix's strong market position, growing advertising business and comprehensive entertainment strategy suggest long-term potential. However, given the significant investments required and execution risks in live programming, investors might benefit from waiting for stronger evidence of successful implementation before increasing exposure.\nStrategic Content Acquisitions\nNetflix's $5 billion deal with WWE for Monday Night Raw represents a significant investment in live programming. Combined with NFL games and special events featuring major entertainers like Beyonc\u00e9, the company is positioning itself as a comprehensive entertainment destination. This diversification strategy could help Netflix maintain its competitive edge in an increasingly crowded streaming landscape.\n\nNetflix expects paid net additions to be higher sequentially in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects substantial growth in paid subscribers, with total paid memberships expected to reach 290.54 million by the end of 2024, indicating an 11.6% year-over-year increase.\nFinancial Implications and Growth Prospects\nThe company expects revenues to grow in the range of 11-13% in 2025, reaching $43-$44 billion. This growth rate represents a slowdown from the 15% expected in 2024. Netflix's investment in live content and infrastructure improvements may pressure margins in the short term, though management targets a 28% operating margin for 2025.\n\nWith total debt reaching $15.98 billion and streaming content obligations at $22.7 billion, Netflix faces significant financial commitments.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $38.91 billion, indicating 15.37% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $19.78 per share, indicating a substantial 64.42% increase from the previous year.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nThe recent surge in Netflix's stock price has led to expanded valuation multiples, potentially limiting future upside for investors. The company's forward 12-month sales multiple of 8.73 exceeds its five-year median of 6.53, indicating that the stock may be trading at a premium to its historical valuation. Moreover, this multiple surpasses the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward earnings multiple of 3.4, suggesting that Netflix's valuation is stretched relative to its peers.\nPrice-to-Sales (Forward 12 Months)\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMarket Position and Competition\nAs traditional media companies increasingly bundle their services, Netflix is taking a different approach by expanding its standalone offering. The addition of live sports and entertainment could help justify future price increases and reduce churn. However, the technical challenges and high costs associated with live programming present risks.\n\nInvestors have responded enthusiastically to Netflix's performance, with NFLX shares returning an impressive 81.5% year to date, significantly outperforming tech giants like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.\nYear-to-date Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Outlook\nWhile Netflix's push into live streaming shows promise, current investors should maintain their positions but new investors might want to wait for a better entry point. The company needs to prove that it can consistently deliver high-quality live streaming experiences before the market fully prices in this growth opportunity. Additionally, the significant investments required for live content rights and technical infrastructure may impact near-term profitability.\nConclusion\nNetflix's venture into live streaming represents both an opportunity and a challenge. While the strategy could strengthen its market position, technical hurdles and high costs suggest caution. Current shareholders should remain invested to benefit from the company's long-term potential, but new investors might find better entry points after Netflix demonstrates consistent execution in live programming delivery.

A Florida-based person named Ronald Blue Denton sued Netflix in state court for what he considered a shoddy performance in delivering the event to its clients in sharp craving, stating that Netflix was unstoppably ill-equipped for the demand for the show, making it unwatchable.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Netflix violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and breached the parties' contract while also demanding monetary damages and a class action on behalf of other affected Netflix subscribers. According to Denton, Netflix is guilty of abdicating its role as a service provider since it failed to provide a perfect viewing experience for millions of people.\nThe November 15 fight that Netflix promoted as its primary sports event attracted 108 million viewers worldwide. Nonetheless, many people used social networks to complain about the declining video quality, numerous instances of buffering, and completely frozen streams, especially if the moment in the match was important.\nNetflix included the topic as part of a significant milestone in sports streaming to establish its dominance in the live segment. Denton's lawsuit now appears to potentially overshadow the feat and is symbolic of the dangers of mounting highly visible live events when viewer expectations steadily rise.\nThis legal dispute could try Netflix for various technical problems and issue a challenge to how the company plans to handle mass streaming events as it faces increasing competition in live sports rights. As of yet, the company has not said anything about this lawsuit.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\nFox Corporation and Netflix are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FOX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nFOX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.71, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 44.06. We also note that FOX has a PEG ratio of 1.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.68.\nAnother notable valuation metric for FOX is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 16.39.\nBased on these metrics and many more, FOX holds a Value grade of A, while NFLX has a Value grade of D.\nFOX sticks out from NFLX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FOX is the better option right now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Page didn't point to traditional charitable foundations or heirs when asked about his thoughts on legacy and philanthropy. Instead, he floated the idea of leaving his wealth to Elon Musk, the tech visionary behind Tesla and SpaceX.\nPage's reasoning? Musk's bold mission to colonize Mars and \"back up humanity.\" In the interview, Rose referenced past comments Page had made about this idea, asking for clarification.\nDon't Miss:\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg?

So I think, you know, we aim to do kind of similar things.\"\nPage then shifted focus to Google's culture of innovation, adding, \"We have a lot of employees at Google who've become pretty wealthy ... A lot of people in there are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world and you want to make it better. So why isn't the company they work for worthy not just of your time, but your money as well?\"\nFor Page, Musk's ambitious goals aligned with his belief that companies, when run effectively, could drive revolutionary change. He elaborated, saying, \"Lots of companies don't succeed over time. They usually miss the future ... I try to focus on that: What is the future really going to be?

Musk's growing concerns about the dangers of artificial intelligence clashed with Page's more optimistic outlook. At Musk's birthday party that year, the two had a heated debate about AI.

In a 2023 podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk said, \"I would like to be friends again with Larry. I haven't seen him in ages.

          "whole_article": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

Trump is expected to turn to one of the two current Republican FTC commissioners to serve as an acting lead for the agency.\n\u201cWith the replacement of Lina Khan, we will see some heavy M&A action kick off even before the Trump administration is sworn in. It will be an interesting time because people are ready to spend and innovate,\u201d said Liz Miller, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department\u2014the other agency that shares antitrust enforcement with the FTC\u2014is likely to move away from recent rhetoric and policies that had a chilling effect on deals, according to industry insiders. \u201cThe Biden administration discouraged lots of transactions by just dragging out the review process and making it longer and expensive,\u201d one industry insider said.\nFor context, Biden\u2019s regulators in 2023 filed a record 50 enforcement actions to fix or block merger transactions.\u00a0 Many blamed Biden\u2019s antitrust zeal with helping slowdown M&A. The number of U.S. announced mergers are running off 34% from 2021, when a record 15,582 deals totaled $2.5 billion [TRILLION RIGHT?] in value, according to data from Dealogic.\n\u201cThe policies advocated by the FTC and the DOJ over the last four years have undoubtedly hampered deal activity and corporates\u2019 willingness to forge into a transaction with the inability to gauge the likelihood of close,\u201d said Michal Katz, head of investment and corporate banking at Mizuho Americas, a division of Mizuho Financial Group.\nBig mergers back on the table?\nOne of the biggest deals that fell by the wayside due to regulatory interference was Nvidia\u2019s $40 billion offer to buy Arm, which was announced in September 2020 while Trump was still in office. It was Biden\u2019s FTC that sued to stop the chip merger in December 2021, leading Nvidia to call off the deal months later, in 2022. There is little chance that Nvidia will ever buy the chip designer now. Arm went public in fall 2023 and is currently worth about $145 billion.\nStory Continues\nSome deals still went forward despite regulatory opposition. Microsoft offered to buy video game developer Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $68.7 billion. Despite an FTC lawsuit to stop the deal, a federal judge sided with the companies and let the merger go ahead, though the agency is currently appealing the decision.\nWhile blocked deals involving giants like Nvidia made the headlines, Michael Sibarium, a partner at law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, says Biden\u2019s antitrust policies also had a chilling impact on smaller deals. This was the case partly due to prolonged review processes that big businesses like Microsoft can better deal with, while smaller companies may lack the resources, Sibarium said. \u201cIf you are one of the wealthiest companies in the world, you can afford to fight if you want to fight. And you can make it go faster by hiring teams and teams of lawyers.\u201d\nAntitrust law under Trump won't be out the window altogether. During the President-elect\u2019s first term, regulators initiated a number of cases against Big Tech. It was Trump\u2019s DOJ that filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google\u2019s search monopoly, resulting in a landmark ruling against the company this year. Under Trump, regulators also sued Facebook over antitrust and called for a ban on TikTok.\nNearly everyone is expecting deals, including mergers and IPOs, to increase next year. Wall Street already has four years getting used to Trump, Mizuho\u2019s Katz said. While it\u2019s unclear which campaign promises he will keep, Trump is a \u201cknown unknown,\u201d Katz said.\n\u201cWe'll see increased dealmaking activity in [IPOs and mergers] because the election uncertainty has been removed from the equation,\u201d she said.\nFortune set out to discover which deals may get a second chance under Trump 2.0. One private equity executive who invests in tech said many companies \u201cdon\u2019t want to be the guinea pig to try and see what can be approved [under Trump], especially if they have tried once before and failed.\u201d For that reason, we have chosen not to include some deals that were emphatically rejected, like Adobe\u2019s failed buy of Figma, or where companies have clearly signaled a merger is not on the table, such as with Cigna and Humana.\nHere is our list of five super size deal that could get the green light in 2025:\nKroger-Albertson\nIn October 2022, Kroger agreed to buy Albertsons in a $24.6 billion grocery store merger that would combine two rivals in one of the biggest supermarket mergers in history. In February, the FTC sued to block the transaction, alleging the merger would lead to higher prices for groceries and other essential household items. Judges in three separate states\u2014Oregon, Colorado and Washington\u2014are reviewing the case, including one in Seattle who was expected to issue a decision on Nov. 15 but has since delayed.\u00a0 Kroger\u2019s stock has gained about 4% since the Nov. 5 presidential election while Albertsons has increased by about 3%.\nAlphabet-HubSpot\nThere were two possible Google/Alphabet deals this year. In one, Alphabet considered making a $25 billion offer to buy CRM provider HubSpot earlier this year, according to press reports. Negotiations didn\u2019t get to the due diligence phase before Alphabet walked away. In the other, Google held discussions to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion before that deal dissolved. Either deal would've been Google's biggest ever and both risked attracting antitrust scrutiny, which likely contributed to the decision to call off both. Under Trump, scrutiny could get less intense, opening the door for it to snap up Wix or Hubspot. Trump and the GOP, however, have cultural axes to grind with Big Tech, meaning Google could have a harder time than others. Shares of HubSpot, which beat third quarter estimates earlier in November, have rocketed 27% since Nov. 5. Wiz, meanwhile, has said it\u2019s pursuing an IPO.\nQualcomm-Intel\nQualcomm is said to have approached Intel in September about buying the slumping chipmaker. Qualcomm backed off the deal as it waited to see who won the U.S. presidential election, Bloomberg reported. A merger would likely draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators around the world, including the U.S. and China, the story said. Intel\u2019s stock is up about 9% since the election. Intel declined comment.\nTempur Sealy-Mattress Firm\nTempur Sealy, the world\u2019s largest mattress supplier and maker, agreed to buy rival Mattress Firm for $4 billion in May 2023. In July, the FTC voted to block the deal, arguing that the Tempur Sealy will have the \u201cability and incentive to suppress competition and raise prices for mattresses for millions of consumers\u201d once it buys Mattress Firm. In September, Tempur Sealy said it believed a \"successful litigation process can be completed in the coming months\" and expected the deal to close later in 2024 or early 2025. It also agreed to divest some Mattress Firm retail locations and its Sleep Outfitters subsidiary. Tempur Sealy filed a motion in October asking a Texas district court judge for a preliminary injunction that would stop the FTC\u2019s administrative proceeding that is set to begin on Dec. 4. The FTC is also pursuing a federal court case to stop the merger, also in the southern district of Texas, that began on Nov. 11 and is ongoing. Shares of Tempur Sealy have gained more than 11% since the election.\nNippon Steel-U.S. Steel\nThe fate of Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel\u2019s nearly $15 billion buy of U.S. Steel, announced in 2023, is unclear. The Biden administration has said it would block it. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, was reviewing the deal but has yet to issue its final recommendation. The merger has faced significant opposition from Trump, and the United Steelworkers. Eiji Hashimoto, Nippon\u2019s chairman and CEO, told Japanese weekly Shunkan Bunshun on Nov. 13 that he hasn\u2019t ruled out suing the U.S. government if regulators block the acquisition. U.S. Steel\u2019s stock has gained about 6% since Nov. 5 while ADRs for Nippon are up about 2%.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street.\nData centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Europe is an ideal holiday destination thanks to its close proximity, its history, culture and beautiful landscapes and while a European adventure may seem costly, exploring the continent doesn\u2019t need to break the bank.\nThanks to budget airlines, rail passes and a variety of affordable lodging choices, travellers can explore Europe\u2019s highlights without overspending.\nWhether strolling through Paris, island-hopping in Greece, or discovering hidden historic gems in Eastern Europe, there are plenty of ways to travel across Europe on a budget.\nLow-cost airlines: budget-friendly flights across Europe\nTaking advantage of low-cost airlines is one of the easiest ways to travel across Europe affordably. Airlines like Ryanair (RYA.IR), EasyJet (EZJ.L), and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) frequently offer flights between major European cities for as little as \u00a310-\u00a320.\nBooking early can help you maximise savings: Look for deals at least two to three months in advance. Websites like Skyscanner or Kayak can help you find the lowest fares.\nBeing flexible is also important. If you can fly mid-week or at off-peak times (early morning or late at night), you can often secure cheaper tickets. Use tools like Google Flights (GOOG) to explore flexible date options.\nBe careful to watch out for hidden fees though. Budget airlines often charge extra for baggage, seat selection and food. Pack light and travel with only a carry-on to avoid additional costs.\nCheck sites such as AirHelp for information on compensation for delays and cancellations.\nRail passes: Interrail for flexible, affordable travel\nIf you prefer travelling by land, consider the Interrail Global Pass, which allows unlimited train travel across 33 countries in Europe. This pass is excellent for exploring multiple destinations without the hassle of flying.\nTo keep things budget-friendly, consider using overnight trains. They help you save on accommodation since you can sleep while moving between cities. Check Trainline (TRN.L) for schedules and routes.\nSome high-speed trains require reservations, so always check ahead to avoid unexpected costs; you can find reservation details on the Interrail website.\nBudget accommodation: hostels, Airbnb and house-sitting\nAccommodation can be one of the largest expenses when travelling, but there are plenty of ways to save. Modern hostels are a good choice as they offer clean and affordable private rooms.\nWebsites like Hostelworld (HSW.L) feature user reviews to help you find the best options. Of course, Airbnb (ABNB) is many people's preferred option and has a wide presence across Europe. It's worth noting that many governments are increasingly limiting Airbnb lets in some cities to avoid locals being priced out of property, so availability may not be as high as in previous years.\nStory continues\nRead more: How to get the best holiday exchange rates\nRenting a room or apartment can be more affordable than hotels, especially outside the city centre. Use filters where searching on Airbnb to find listings with a kitchen to save on meals.\n'Couch surfing' is another viable choice if you're happy to share your space. The platform allows you to stay with locals for free, offering a unique cultural experience. Sign up and create a profile at Couchsurfing.\nHouse-sitting has become increasingly popular in recent years: Websites like TrustedHousesitters connect you with homeowners looking for someone to care for their pets and home. This can provide free accommodation. Learn more about house-sitting here.\nBest cities for budget travellers\nWhile many European capitals can be pricey, several budget-friendly destinations offer rich experiences for less. Here are our top five picks.\nBudapest, Hungary: Famous for its thermal baths and historic architecture, Budapest offers affordable food, accommodation, and public transport. Explore budget-friendly eateries through Eatwith.\nKrakow, Poland: With historical sites like Wawel Castle and Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial, Krakow is a treasure trove of history at a low cost. Use the Krakow City Card for discounts on attractions.\nLisbon, Portugal: Lisbon\u2019s picturesque views and low-cost food make it a perfect budget destination. Try local dishes at Time Out Market for authentic, affordable dining.\nPrague, Czech Republic: Despite its popularity, Prague remains budget-friendly. Use Prague Free Walking Tours to discover the city by paying what you can.\nValencia, Spain: Valencia boasts stunning beaches and a rich food scene. Check out Mercado Central for local delicacies at reasonable prices.\nTime and plan your visit well\nTo stretch your budget even further, avoiding common tourist traps is a must. Food-wise, you can avoid dining in touristy areas, and venture into local neighbourhoods for cheaper, authentic meals. Use apps like The Fork or Quandoo to find nearby restaurants with deals.\nYou also don't need to splash out on attractions since most cities will have plenty you can access for free. Look for free walking tours, museums with free entry days, and public parks or landmarks.\nRead more: 3 Tips for Using Your Holiday Shopping To Get Credit Card Rewards\nMany places also have free attractions, so check the destination websites.\nFinally, avoid peak seasons if you can. Travelling during summer means higher prices and larger crowds. Aim for the shoulder seasons (spring or autumn) for lower rates and milder weather.\nWebsites like Kayak offer price alerts for different seasons.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

McKinsey analysis suggests that demand for AI-ready data center capacity will rise at an average rate of 33% a year between 2023 and 2030 in a midrange scenario. Per the consulting firm, this means that around 70% of total demand for data center capacity will be for data centers equipped to host advanced-AI workloads by 2030.

In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

It is the third-largest company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.07 trillion.\nIt will report its Q2 2025 earnings on Jan. 28, 2025.

So, $1,200 / 0.008 = $150,000 to generate an income of $100 per month.\nStory Continues\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock\u2019s current price.\nThe dividend yield can change over time due to fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.\nTrending: The Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. Earn a 1% return boost on your first EquityMultiple investment when you sign up here (accredited investors only).\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).\nIn summary, income-focused investors may find Microsoft stock an attractive option for making a steady income of $100 per month by owning 362 shares of stock. There may be more upside as investors benefit from the company's consistent dividend hikes.

However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Microsoft's ROE.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Microsoft\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:\n31% = US$91b \u00f7 US$288b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.31 in profit.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nMicrosoft's Earnings Growth And 31% ROE\nTo begin with, Microsoft has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 12% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Microsoft was able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the last five years.\nWe then compared Microsoft's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.\nNasdaqGS:MSFT Past Earnings Growth November 23rd 2024\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is MSFT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\nStory Continues\nIs Microsoft Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\nMicrosoft has a three-year median payout ratio of 26%, which implies that it retains the remaining 74% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.\nBesides, Microsoft has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 22% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 27%.\nConclusion\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Microsoft's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

Yahoo Finance readers have their say\nYvonne McGill, chief financial officer at Dell Technologies, said that the company's momentum in its infrastructure solutions group business was a \"significant tailwind\", with a record revenue of $11.6bn, which was up 38% year-on-year.\nThis part of the business includes AI-optimised servers which are powered by Nvidia's chips.\nDell shares soared following the release of its second quarter results in August, with the stock up 82% year-to-date.\nThe company's recent performance marked an improvement from earlier in the year, with Dell having revealed a 2.5% fall in gross margins in the first quarter due to slower demand for its AI servers.\nDell then reportedly announced a fresh round of job cuts in August as part of reorganisation of its sales teams with a new unit focused on AI.\nStory continues\nBloomberg reported that Dell sales executives Bill Scannell and John Byrne had said the business was getting \"leaner\" and was \"streamlining layers of management and reprioritizing where we invest\".\n\u2022 USD\n(DELL)\nFollow\nView quote details\nAnalog Devices (ADI) \u2014 Reports fourth quarter results on Tuesday 26 November\nChipmaker Analog Devices is considered as a valuable barometer of economic activity in the US and globally.\nIt specialises in analogue, mixed-signal processing, and power management chips, serving more than 125,000 customers across diverse sectors, offering more than 75,000 products. Just over half of its sales are driven by industrial markets, a quarter by the automotive sector, with the remainder coming from communications and consumer applications.\nAnalog Devices' shares have been volatile this year, which has meant the stock is less than 8% in the green year-to-date.\nHowever, the company's CEO Vincent Roche noted a \"nascent recovery\" in the business cycle in the third quarter.\nRead more: UK consumer confidence rises after budget and US election\nRevenue for this period came in at $2.3bn, which was above the midpoint of its outlook, with growth in industrial, consumer and communications areas of the business.

Manchester United finished last season in eighth place in the Premier League, having won 18 matches but losing 14 games.\nThis season Man Utd has sunk lower in the league, languishing down at 13th place, having lost four and won the same number of matches, while drawing three games. There's currently an eight-point gap between United and its main rival Manchester City, which stands at second place in the Premier League.\nRuben Amorim, former manager of Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon, was named as ten Hag's successor at the beginning of November and this weekend's match against Ipswich Town will be his first as manager.\nRead more: Major companies that are also popular short-selling stocks\nAmorim's debut will be followed by the club's first quarter financial results, which are due out on Tuesday.\nIn the fourth quarter, Manchester United posted a 15% fall in total revenue to \u00a3142m ($177m), compared with the same quarter last year. This left the compared with just 2% growth in revenue for the year, at nearly \u00a3662m.\nLosses for the year widened to \u00a3113m, up from nearly \u00a329m in 2023 and marked its fifth consecutive year of net losses, according to Reuters.\nOmar Berrada, who took over as CEO in the summer, said: \"We are working towards greater financial sustainability and making changes to our operations to make them more efficient, to ensure we are directing our resources to enhancing on-pitch performance.\"\nManchester United started work on its business transformation plan at the beginning of the fourth quarter in 2024, with the club aiming to generate annual cost savings of around \u00a340m to \u00a345m, before implementation costs of \u00a310m.\nIn terms of outlook, the club guided to revenue of \u00a3650m to \u00a3670m for the 2025 fiscal year and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, debt and amortisation of \u00a3145m to \u00a3160m.\n\u2022 USD\n(MANU)\nFollow\nView quote details\nUrban Outfitters (URBN) \u2014 Reports third quarter results on Tuesday 26 November\nAnother company set to report on Tuesday is Urban Outfitters, whose brands also include Anthropologie and Free People, with shares in the clothing retailer up just 5% year-to-date.\nAnalysts are expecting Urban Outfitters to post quarterly earnings of $0.84 per share, which points to a year-on-year decline of 4.6%, according to Zacks Equity Research.\nRevenues are expected to come in at $1.3bn, which would be 4.1% higher than the same period last year.\nRead more: FTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win\nThe company reported record sales for the second quarter, rising 6.3% to $1.4bn and logged net income of $117.5m, with earnings per diluted share of $1.24.\nNet sales were highest from Anthropologie and Free People, which are the company's higher-end brands.\nRichard A. Hayne, CEO of Urban Outfitters, also highlighted that four of the company's five brands delivered record operating profits during the second quarter.\nThe majority of analysts have a \"hold\" recommendation on the stock, according to Yahoo Finance data. Most recently, Citigroup reiterated a neutral rating on the stock.\n\u2022 USD\n(URBN)\nFollow\nView quote details\nEasyJet (EZJ.L) \u2014 Reports full year results on Wednesday 27 November\nBudget airline easyJet was among the low-cost carriers that had been slapped with a fine by Spain's consumer rights ministry, according to an announcement on Friday.\nEasyJet, along with Ryanair (RYA.IR), International Airlines Group's (IAG.L) Vueling, fellow Spanish airlines Volotea and Norwegian Air Shuttle, have been fined a combined combined \u20ac179m (\u00a3149m).\nIn a statement released Friday, the ministry said the fines were over \"abusive practices such as charging extra for hand luggage or reserving adjacent seats to accompany dependent persons\", according to a translation.\nEasyJet was fined \u20ac29m of the total amount, though shares were still more than 1% in the green by Friday afternoon.\nLooking to the easyJet's upcoming earnings on Wednesday, this will be the last set of results with Johan Lundgren as CEO, before chief financial officer, Kenton Jarvis, takes the reins in January.\nRead more: Rise in UK borrowing shows Reeves has 'little wiggle room' on spending\nAnalysts are expecting easyJet to post a headline pre-tax profit of \u00a3595m for the year, according to AJ Bell's investment experts Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatswort. This would be up from \u00a3455m a year ago.\nKey metrics behind this headline figure include capacity, which is expected to have grown 8% to 100 million in the year to September 2024. Airline revenue per seat is among the other figures that analysts will be watching, with a benchmark of \u00a379.84 last year.\nIn terms of dividends, analysts are expecting a payout of 12p per share, with this anticipated to rise to 14.8p for the year ending September 2025.\nAarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that easyJet's last set of results \"landed well with markets, who had become nervous after rival Ryanair issued a weak performance over the same period. But easyJet bucked the trend by selling a higher percentage of its available seats for the fourth quarter, despite increasing its capacity by 7%.\n\"This was enough to reassure investors that the group remains on the right flight path to deliver another record-breaking summer,\" he said.\nChiekrie added: \"Recent industry data shows that air travel demand continues to soar higher, and investors are eager to hear what easyJet sees on the horizon in next week\u2019s results.\u201d\n\u2022 USD\n(EZJ.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nOther companies reporting next week include:\nMonday 25 November\nAlimentation Couche-Tard (ATD.TO)\nAgilent (A)\nZoom Video Communications (ZM)\nBath and Body Works (BBWI)\nTuesday 26 November\nCompass (CPG.L)\nRenew (RNWH.L)\nAO World (AO.L)\nTopps Tiles (TPT.L)\nLondonmetric Property (LMP.L)\nHalfords (HFD.L)\nBrickability (BRCK.L)\nVP (VP.L)\nIG Design (IGR.L)\nSosandar (SOS.L)\nIntercede (IGP.L)\nHelical (HLCL.L)\nSupreme (SUP.L)\nIntertek (ITRK.L)\nSafestore (SAFE.L)\nH World (1179.HK)\nCrowdStrike (CRWD)\nAutodesk (ADSK)\nHewlett Packard (HPE)\nBestBuy (BBY)\nJM Smucker (SJM)\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF)\nMacy\u2019s Inc (M)\nNordstrom (JWN)\nWednesday 27 November\nJohnson Matthey (JMAT.L)\nPennon (PNN.L)\nPets At Home (PETS.L)\nThursday 28 November\nGreencore (GNC.L)\nDowlais (DWL.L)\nRemy Cointreau (RCO.PA)\nKroger (KR)\nFriday 29 November\nPeel Hunt (PEEL.L)\nFrontline (FRO)\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\nRead more on stocks:\nWhat does the launch of pension megafunds mean for investors?\nHow Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nGlobal dividends hit record high but UK companies lag behind\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

          "whole_article": "The upcoming report from CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a decline of 1.2% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $982.26 million, representing an increase of 25% year over year.\nThe current level reflects no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some CrowdStrike metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- Subscription' of $936.57 million. The estimate suggests a change of +27.7% year over year.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenue- Professional services' stands at $49.04 million. The estimate indicates a change of -6.7% from the prior-year quarter.\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- United States' to reach $682.66 million. The estimate indicates a change of +26.9% from the prior-year quarter.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Annual recurring revenue (ARR)' should arrive at $4,001,747.00. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $3,150,000.\nAnalysts expect 'Non-GAAP subscription gross profit' to come in at $752.42 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $588.69 million.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Non-GAAP professional services gross profit' should come in at $16.57 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $23.02 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'GAAP professional services gross profit' reaching $11.95 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $17.38 million.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'GAAP subscription gross profit' will reach $734.84 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $573.63 million.\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for CrowdStrike here>>>\n\nOver the past month, shares of CrowdStrike have returned +17.4% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +17.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.25 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other trending AI stocks that are making waves today.\nIs artificial intelligence a tool for the rich countries and the wealthy? Even if it is, Chinese President Xi Jinping warns that it shouldn\u2019t be. At the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Xi noted that AI shouldn\u2019t be a game of the affluent, calling on more international governance and cooperation on the matter. In a separate meeting in Peru, Xi and Joe Biden also agreed that human beings, and not artificial intelligence, should be making decisions about nuclear weapons, as reported by The White House.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Stories You Can\u2019t Miss and\u00a015 AI News Making Waves Right Now\nThe call for equitable AI development and responsible decision-making underscores the growing global focus on AI's impact, and all the latest developments being made in the AI realm. As the global race to advance AI accelerates, one country striving to secure its position in this competitive landscape is Japan. The country is reportedly readying a $65-billion push in microchips and artificial intelligence, as revealed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this month. The move comes amid the country\u2019s efforts to reclaim its status as a global tech leader.\nNews like these underscores how artificial intelligence continues to be a dominant theme in the business world. A Cisco 2024 AI Readiness Report reveals how companies around the world realize that the momentum for AI deployment is building fast, pulling up immense pressure on them in the process. However, only 13% of companies are ready to leverage AI and AI-powered technologies to their full potential. This is a 1-point decline from last year. Even though organizations are doing their best to leverage AI, the ROI is nowhere in the picture for many.\nAccording to an AI consultant Rider Harris, some major reasons for companies failing to reap ROIs are that they probably invested in a bad tool, they weren\u2019t trained enough (or at all), there\u2019s a lack of excitement on the fear that AI may take their job away, or there may even be a lack of resources for employees to adequately make use of or navigate those tools. \u00a0This is why focusing on aspects such as training employees, getting them excited about the AI tool, and providing adequate resources can go a long way.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity technology company harnessing artificial intelligence to streamline and strengthen cyber protection.\nOn November 20, Stifel raised the firm\u2019s price target on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

Recent checks on the company\u2019s faulty update back in July demonstrate mixed trends. However, the impact of the issue is seen to be fading, and there is growing confidence in the company\u2019s medium-term market opportunities. Despite facing legal action from Delta Airlines, there is optimism around the company\u2019s performance, with growth expectations by the second half of 2026. The company has also formed a strategic partnership with Plurilock Security Inc. to enhance protection for critical infrastructure, leveraging AI-native cybersecurity solution Falcon.\nOverall CRWD ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks that are making waves today.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves right now.\nWith Donald Trump having won the elections, it seems Elon Musk is going to be a powerful force in the administration.\u00a0 After all, X CEO has played an outsized role in his comeback, contributing millions to his campaign, serving as policy advisor, and even using his social media platform as a Make America Great Again (MAGA) advocacy platform.\nNow that his efforts have come to fruition Max Tegmark, a leading scientist, who has previously worked with the world\u2019s richest person says Musk\u2019s influence could lead to tougher safety standards for artificial intelligence, as reported by The Guardian.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Stories Shaking Up Wall Street\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nTegmark says Musk\u2019s backing of a failed AI bill demonstrated that Musk is still worried about the repercussions of uncontrolled AI development. The SB 1047 bill in California required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them.\nHaving frequently warned that such an unrestrained development can be catastrophic for humanity, Musk was one of the 30,000 others who had signed a letter calling for a pause on the development of advanced AI technology last year.\nAccording to Tegmark, Musk could convince Trump to introduce standards that prevent the growth of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a term used for AI systems that match or surpass human levels of intelligence.\n\u201cI do think that if Elon manages to get Trump\u2019s ear on AI issues we\u2019re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI. He might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.\u201d\nBefore Trump won the elections, Musk had predicted the development of artificial intelligence that would be smarter than the smartest human being by next year or by 2026.\n\"If you define AGI (artificial general intelligence) as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably next year, within two years\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

In particular, the firm believes that Crowdstrike\u2019s recent challenges, especially its global IT outage on July 19th, may lead to lower upsell revenue.

This caused significant reputational damage to the cybersecurity leader, as the outage led to grounded flights, canceled medical procedures and widespread disruption. Following this incident, the stock took a sharp dive, dropping from $345 to $264 on July 22, as investors reacted to the news.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRWD.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nThe repercussions from the July 19 outage was revealed when the company reported its Q2 FY25 earnings. Despite the outage, the company managed to outperform wall-street analysts' revenue and earnings expectations, leading to a 3% stock price increase following the earnings release. However, with its Q2 FY25 earnings results, management released its lowered top-line and bottom-line guidance for the upcoming quarters. Despite this lowered guidance, the stock largely rebounded, and is now in line with the S&P 500's YTD returns. My long-term investment perspective for CrowdStrike lies on one key trend in cybersecurity: the growing demand from enterprise customers to consolidate multiple-vendor solutions onto a single platform to cut costs. Consequently, the recent macroeconomic pressures have forced enterprise customers to focus on efficiency and find ways to do more with less. Thus, this key trend remains strong and I believe CrowdStrike is well-positioned to benefit, as it provides one of the top platforms in the market at significant cost-savings.\nThe Falcon Platform: One-Stop Shop\nCrowdStrike is basically known as an endpoint protection company in the cybersecurity market, but I don't think this fully captures the scope of services that the company currently offers. In reality, it operates as a one-stop platform for enterprise cybersecurity solutions, which was a key point highlighted during its Q2 FY25 earnings presentation. While there are many competitors in the industry, no other competitor is able to offer the scope of services that CrowdStrike does. Thus, as mentioned previously, I believe that CrowdStrike is positioned well to benefit in a time where enterprises are increasingly looking to consolidate its cybersecurity infrastructure. As a result, CrowdStrike's platform is able to serve as a consolidated solution, which is difficult to compete with in the current cybersecurity landscape.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nGeorge Kurtz (CEO of CrowdStrike) pointed out that enterprise customers are focused on efficiency and reducing complexity, noting that Customers don't want to go backwards and have a patchwork of products. They are still focused on the consolidation piece and they're looking at us as one of the key consolidators in the market\". What was actually meant by this statement is evident in the fact that about 65% of the company's customers use five or more modules, 45% use six or more and 30% use seven or modules. Furthermore, among larger customers that spend over $100,000 annually on CrowdStrike's services, nearly half use eight or more modules. This highlights the depth of the consolidation in CrowdStrike's cybersecurity customer portfolio, making it significantly challenging to compete with.\nFurther, I found a research piece from Gartner that noted that 75% of enterprise customers are actively looking to decrease the number of cybersecurity vendors that they work with, further supporting the industry trend of vendor consolidation. Thus, the primary goal for enterprise customers is to increase integration and lower vendor management costs, and this shift will likely result in a handful of dominant players emerging in the market. Given CrowdStrike's early focus on consolidation through its Falcon platform, it is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.\nPost-Outage Recovery\nPost the outage on July 19, CrowdStrike experienced some disruption in its sales pipeline with a few deals placed on hold, and to be finalized in subsequent quarters. Consequently, management clarified to investors that the larger part of those delayed deals would still stay in the pipeline. That said, investors should be prepared to hear that some of the new customers are going to be more cautious than usual, since the company has lost some trust within the marketplace as a result of the outage. During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, CFO Burt Podbere noted the following: \"We expect to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, with additional scrutiny requiring higher levels of approval at the CEO and, in some cases, Board of Directors level.\" The meaning behind this is simple: the longer the list of approvals, the more protracted the sales cycle will be, especially in large corporations. Although the CFO didn't mention the exact delay periods, I expect bigger deals to take close to six months to finalize.\nTo address the situation, it appears that CrowdStrike has introduced customer commitment packages, wherein the company gives a discount and other incentives to their customers in return for signing longer-term contracts. This may, however, affect the company's revenues for the next few quarters, but it's important to note that CrowdStrike still managed to win several eight and nine-figure deals despite the outage. For example, within cloud security, CrowdStrike secured an eight-figure deal with a major enterprise software firm, which opted to standardize on Falcon Cloud Security across its entire business, replacing another next-gen cloud security vendor. Similarly, a nine-figure cloud security deal saw a large enterprise adopt Falcon Cloud Security across a million hosts, replacing other cloud security products.\nIn the Security information and event management (SIEM) market, CrowdStrike continues to outperform legacy SIEM providers. Two major deals stand out: an eight-figure deal with an existing customer, which replaced two legacy SIEMs with CrowdStrike's LogScale, resulting in over 60% cost savings, and a seven-figure deal with a leading generative AI company, which standardized on LogScale after a year of use, improving search speed, response times, and total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to their previous legacy SIEM solution.\nExpanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)\nCrowdStrike's growth story is further supported by the expanding TAM. In 2024, the TAM for cybersecurity is expected to be around $100 billion, but this figure is projected to grow to $225 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8%. Even if CrowdStrike only manages to grow in line with the market, the company has a long runway for growth. Given its platformization strategy, I believe CrowdStrike is positioned to outpace market growth and capture significant market share.\nStrong Results Despite Challenges\nCrowdStrike's Q2 FY25 results, in my view, basically showcase the company's resilience and strength, even in the face of significant adversity (with the recent outage and macro pressures). The company reported revenue of $964 million (up 31.7% YoY), overperforming wall-street guidance by $5.5 million. With 94% of its revenue coming from subscriptions, the growth in this segment is a key indicator of CrowdStrike's performance. Subscription revenue grew 33% YoY, while ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) was up 32%, reaching $3.9 billion. This included $218 million in net new ARR, an 11% increase YoY, in line with the company's guidance.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nCrowdStrike also reported record non-GAAP operating income of $227 million, representing a 46% YoY increase, signaling excellent operational efficiency. Notably, non-GAAP operating income is growing faster than revenue, demonstrating the company's operating leverage, a key strength in the tech sector, where many companies prioritize growth over profitability.\nRobust Cash Flow Generation\nFree cash flows increased by 44% YoY to $272 million in Q2 FY25, with a 28% free cash flow margin, highlighting the company's ability to fund its own growth. The company achieved what it calls the \"rule of 60\" during the quarter. This means that the sum of its YoY revenue growth rate (approximately 32%) and its free cash flow margin (28%) equals 60. The term is derived from the \"rule of 40,\" a concept introduced by Brad Feld, who describes it as the idea that a company's growth rate combined with its profitability should total at least 40%. For example, a 20% growth rate should correspond with a 20% profit margin, while a 50% growth rate could be paired with a 10% loss. Exceeding this benchmark is rare, which is why investors tend to value CrowdStrike more highly compared to other growth stocks.\nLowered Management Guidance\nAlthough the company reported great Q2 FY25 results despite the outage, the repercussions of the outage is largely reflected in CrowdStrike's full-year guidance. Management lowered its initial revenue guidance for FY25 by 1.5%, now expecting revenue to be between $3.896 billion and $3.989 billion, down from the original forecast of $3.924 billion to $3.989 billion. Non-GAAP operating income guidance was also reduced by 11.23%, with the new midpoint at $788.5 million, down from $888.3 million. While Q3 FY25 is expected to show continued revenue growth of 34.2%, non-GAAP operating income growth is forecasted to slow to 8.3%, reflecting the near-term impact of the outage on profitability.\nCapacity For Continued Investments\nI have already mentioned Crowdstrike's ability to drive impressive revenue growth and operational efficiency. But, in addition to this, the reason that I'm bullish on the company is mainly due to the fact that CrowdStrike's fundamental strengths are also backed by its commitment to reinvest back into the core business. Looking at the closest rival to CrowdStrike (Palo Alto Networks), CrowdStrike's Capex to CFO ratio is relatively higher. Although Palo Alto Networks has larger R&D capex spending in absolute terms, if CRWD sustains its impressive CFO growth, it will likely close the gap with PANW soon. CrowdStrike's top-line and CFO is growing much faster compared to rivals.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nStrong Balance Sheet\nCrowdStrike also maintains a solid balance sheet. As of Q2 FY25, the company held $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents against $743.2 million in long-term debt, giving it a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of 0.28. Furthermore, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.75 suggests that CrowdStrike can comfortably manage its debt using operating profits. Furthermore, while some competitors and investors overhyped the potential for CrowdStrike to lose business, the company's operating leverage remains on track. With its continued focus on platform consolidation, I expect CrowdStrike to maintain its leadership position and recover from the recent setbacks caused by the outage.\nValuation Thoughts\nFrom a valuation standpoint, I am quite optimistic about CrowdStrike's potential. I believe CrowdStrike is currently trading at a significant discount, especially when considering the several growth catalysts that will unfold in both the short and long term. At the moment, CrowdStrike is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23x, which is well below its five-year historical average of 29x. This disparity may suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its historical valuation, presenting a unique buying opportunity for investors. In the near term, I anticipate that CrowdStrike's stock may experience some additional drawdowns as investors reassess their positions in light of the recent outage. However, I view this as a temporary phase, which could provide a compelling entry point for those who may have missed out on the stock during its earlier growth stages.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nHistorically, CrowdStrike's P/S ratio has been considerably higher, so I expect that as the company fully recovers from the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) incident, its valuation will revert closer to the five-year average of 29x. Given these factors, I'm setting a target multiple of 27x, which would imply a price target of around $375 per share. This represents an upside of approximately 20%, which, in my opinion, provides a solid margin for investors to take advantage of at current levels.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[Alpha Spread]\nFrom a discounted cash flow (DCF) perspective, I used a discount rate of 8% (which reflects the company's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC) and applied a conservative terminal growth rate of 5%. This DCF analysis aligns with Wall Street's growth forecasts for CrowdStrike over the next five years, which reflects a topline-growth rate of 15% over the next five years and some operating leverage improvements as the company expands beyond endpoint protection and solidifies its position as a leader in platform consolidation, offering a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity services. The scalability and robustness of the Falcon platform have already been proven, supporting the optimistic outlook from analysts. Based on this DCF model, I derive an upside of roughly 19% (with a target price of $408), which I believe offers ample margin for value investors seeking to capitalize on CrowdStrike's current valuation. Given the company's strong fundamentals, its recovery potential, and the broader market opportunity, I see this as an attractive entry point for those looking to invest at these levels.\nConclusion\nDespite the recent outage and its immediate challenges, I remain confident in CrowdStrike's long-term growth potential. The company's current market position, and the strategy towards platform consolidation positions it well to capitalize on the growing trend of enterprise customers seeking to streamline their cybersecurity solutions with a single provider to save costs and improve efficiency. Even after the setback (with regards to BSOD), CrowdStrike secured significant deals, demonstrating resilience and maintaining market trust. Additionally, with its current valuation appearing attractive compared to historical averages, a robust balance sheet, and a proven ability to drive growth through its Falcon platform, I see this as a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on its recovery and long-term market potential.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 6.7% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nStory Continues\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs CRWD a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.65.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

          "whole_article": "Investor confidence in certain major companies has propelled markets higher, but there are also those betting against big-name stocks through short selling amid continued uncertainty.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly topped the 6,000-point mark in the recent rally following Donald Trump's election win, though they have since eased back, with the main US index closing Wednesday's session flat at 5,917.\nWhile markets broadly rose following the US election, there were a particular group of stocks that rallied in what has been dubbed the \"Trump trade\", around expectations as to the policies that the Republican president-elect could look to implement after he returns to the White House in January.\nOne of which was Tesla (TSLA), as the electric carmaker's CEO Elon Musk was a major supporter of Trump's campaign and has since been nominated by the president-elect to co-lead the recently announced Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nRead more: FTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win\nThe post-election rally in Tesla stock pushed its market valuation to over the $1tn mark, which was welcome news for investors that are bullish about the company's prospects.\nHowever, not all investors were reaping the benefits, as data from S3 Partners showed that short-sellers had lost nearly $8bn by the Monday after the election, according to Business Insider.\nUnlike the traditional way of investing in markets by buying shares with the goal of selling them at a higher price, also known as going \"long\", short selling aims to make a profit on the declining price of the stock. An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.\nThe hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.\nAnd while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.\nAnalysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) in the last month.\nHere are the major companies that have become popular shorts.\nPopular short stocks\nS3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.\nStory continues\nChipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.\nThe demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.\nAt the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.\nShares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.\nAnd Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.\nRead more: Rise in UK borrowing shows Reeves has 'little wiggle room' on spending\nThe discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.\nTesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.\nHowever, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve \"slight growth\" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.\nS3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).\nFollowing its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.\nS&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this \"may be related to the [US] election\".\nThey said that despite this significant activity in \"all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses\".\nGlobal short bets\nMeanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.\nThe data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on \"crowdedness\", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors\u2019 supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.\nLVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.\nThe company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an \"uncertain economic and geopolitical environment\" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.\nRead more: FTSE 100 and European-listed stocks to own in 2025, according to Barclays\nThe luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\nKering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.\nShares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.\nMultinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.\nDiageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIt has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.\nIn South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.\nRead more: What we know about planned UK private stock market Pisces\nHindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were \"nothing but a lie\".\nOn Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.\nShares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.\nIn a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were \"baseless\".\nHindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.\nHowever, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

          "whole_article": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024\nHow Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.\nOf course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\nStory Continues\nBroadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.\nOur View\nWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers\u2014critical components for Nvidia\u2019s AI-focused operations.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nA strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.\nHistorically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s during major market reactions. Nvidia\u2019s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.\nHow To Buy AVGO Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\nStory Continues\nCheck It Out:\nArrived Achieved A Total Return of 34.7% On Their Biggest Sale Yet \u2014 Diversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure.\nOnce the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months.\nNvidia (NVDA) earnings \u2014 coming after the bell Wednesday \u2014 will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday.\n\"It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,\" said Essaye. \"It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.\"\nNvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock \u2014 up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years \u2014 hit record highs following the election.\nBut many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.\nSemiconductor returns during the second half of 2024\nThe worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.\nMeanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) \u2014 seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor \u2014 is down 14%.\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTo be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday.\n\"Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],\" said Essaye.\nSince the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia \u2014 \"priced to perfection\" according to many analysts \u2014 underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.\nStory Continues\nBut Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this \"bellwether\" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.\n\"They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far,\" he said. \"I think they can do it again.\"\nmorning brief image\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.\nWhen it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there\u2019s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University\u2019s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).\nFounded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university\u2019s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard\u2019s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard\u2019s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university\u2019s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard\u2019s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.\nAccording to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. \u201cNarv\u201d Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia\u2019s 11.5% or Brown\u2019s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC\u2019s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:\n\u201cIn FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC\u2019s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.\u201d\nNotably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from \"overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500.\" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar\u2019s strategy of overhauling the university\u2019s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Harvard Management Company\u2019s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nHarvard Management Company's Stake: $89.6 million\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the world\u2019s largest technology companies, with operations spanning the hardware and software sectors. The company\u2019s primary strength is in hardware, as it supplies networking and custom chips across diverse applications.\nIn its third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and robust non-AI semiconductor sales. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI revenue to grow 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the annual AI revenue to $12 billion, largely fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOn November 6, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company\u2019s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing \u201cseasonal headwinds\u201d linked to a product transition for Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's \"easy\" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some \"serious gains.\"\n\"I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It\u2019s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don\u2019t count. But that, people, is nonsense.\"\nCramer said banks do not \"care\" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.\n\"I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I\u2019m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.\"\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks.\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nCommenting about Broadcom in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said:\n\u201cI am also pulling for Broadcom. I think Broadcom should do well. I don\u2019t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.\u201d\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market.\u00a0Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe continued to build our position in\u00a0Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nCan we expect growth from ServiceNow?\nNYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.\nOn November 18, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) announced that it has expanded its strategic alliance with Microsoft. Building on their existing partnership, Service Now\u2019s Now Assist and Microsoft 365 Copilot integration will now enable streamlined workflows and enable self-service capabilities within Microsoft applications. In essence, the strategic alliance will help modernize front-office business processes. Copilot will simplify tasks through intelligent automation, while ServiceNow AI agents will manage workflows and offer solutions to complex problems.\n\u201cA strong partnership between ServiceNow and Microsoft means customers gain the best of both worlds: seamless, secure, and smart workflows. By combining our strengths, we're enabling organizations to harness AI and automation in ways that fundamentally change how they work\u2014reducing complexity, driving productivity, and helping teams move faster. This partnership isn\u2019t just about technology; it's about setting customers up for long-term success in a digital world.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:\n14% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\nTo start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.\nNYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\nStory Continues\nIs ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Most recently, both companies introduced ServiceNow Now Assist and Microsoft 365 Copilot integration which streamlines workflows and enables self-service capabilities within Microsoft applications. Initial use cases include employee and IT scenarios where employees working in Microsoft Teams can use Copilot to search the ServiceNow knowledge base, request service catalog items through a guided, conversational experience, and ask to chat with a live agent when a case needs to be escalated. Now Assist provides employees with responses to questions as well as recommended actions and next steps in a conversational manner based on domain knowledge of the enterprise and awareness of the user\u2019s context and organizational data from Microsoft 365 chats, email, calendar, and files.\nAI-enhanced products and services are rapidly becoming a central theme for C-suite executives looking to digitally transform their businesses. With this expanded partnership, ServiceNow and Microsoft will advance their vision to reimagine the front-office with a Microsoft Copilot and ServiceNow AI agent collaboration that leverages the unique strengths of both platforms. Guided by strong governance and human oversight, these front-end agents will solve customer problems in Copilot to seamlessly connect back-end workflows.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market\u2026 Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting\u2026 Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again\u2026 Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company\u2019s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.\nOverall NOW ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing \u201csovereign\u201d artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to \u201ccodify\u201d a country\u2019s culture, history, and collective intelligence.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News You Must Read Today.\nThat said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.\u201d\nWhile AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.\nLatest Advancements in AI\nIn recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification\u201d.\nStory Continues\nOther fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.\nIn other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed \u201cOperator\u201d, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human\u2019s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia\u2019s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.\nThis partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.\nFor the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%.

However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.\nAfter trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.\nWith the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.\nPost earnings low: $36\nGap fill: $33\n21-day: $32\n50-day: $29.20\n200-day: $25.20\nFibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32\nWhile that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.\nIn Summary\nToast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.\nThe company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.\nAs Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.\nBear of the Day:\nClean Harbors \u00a0is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.\nThe company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?\nWith an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.\nAbout the Company\nClean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).\nThe company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world\u2019s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.\nCLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cD\u201d in Value, But \u201cB\u201d in both Momentum and Growth.\nQ3 Earnings\nThe company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.\nDespite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.\nPositive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.\nWhile there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.\nEarnings Estimates\nEstimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.\nFor the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.\nLooking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.\nFor the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year\u2019s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.\nTechnical Take\nThe drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.\nThis volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.\nThe drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.\nThe stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.\nIn Summary\nClean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.\nWith significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.\nAdditional content:\nServiceNow Expands Generative AI Offerings: Is the Stock a Buy?\nServiceNow\u00a0is adding Generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to the Now platform to foster responsible AI. NOW is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio, including new, expanded Now Assist capabilities with an AI Governance feature for secure and compliant AI practices.\nNOW\u2019s expanding GenAI portfolio and rich partner base have been driving top-line growth.

The free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, subscription revenues are projected between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 21.5-22% on a GAAP basis. At cc, subscription revenues are expected to grow at 20.5%.\nCurrent Remaining Performance Obligation is expected to grow 21.5% year over year on both non-GAAP and GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% for the current quarter.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $13.87 per share, up 0.4% over the past 30 days, indicating a 28.66% year-over-year increase.\nServiceNow, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ServiceNow, Inc. Quote\nThe consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.\nStrong Portfolio Aids NOW\u2019s Prospects\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.\nServiceNow\u2019s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.\nThe Xanadu update adds the latest AI capabilities to boost customer agility, enhance productivity and improve employee experiences.

It is expected to reduce the time to resolve an issue and make live agents more productive.\nStrong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive\nA strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nNOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.\nThe strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.\nIn third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.\nNOW\u2019s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation\nHowever, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector\u2019s 6.37X.\nWe believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow\u2019s premium valuation.\nConclusion\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.\nServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) Elevates Now Platform with Enhanced AI Governance and GenAI Solutions\nA technician connecting an EV battery to the Grid Integrated Vehicle platform.\nServiceNow, Inc.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in NOW?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.\nInsiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nNYSE:NOW Insider Trading Volume November 14th 2024\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of ServiceNow\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?\nInsiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps digitize and unify organizations so that they can find smarter, faster, better ways to make work flow.\nOn November 12, Wells Fargo raised the firm\u2019s price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $1,150 from $1,050 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares. According to the firm, ServiceNow is among the few companies that are demonstrating tangible AI monetization, i.e. they are really making money from AI. One of the key catalysts that will drive this momentum forward is the launch of its CSM/ITSM agents in Xanadu on November 24. The launch is a major step for the company in enhancing its AI-led customer service offerings. Finally, Wells Fargo expects ServiceNow to take the lead in AI customer service.\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them.

The charter, signed by major tech companies, aimed to combat online fraud by introducing a series of protective measures, including the verification of new advertisers and the swift removal of fraudulent content. However, despite these commitments, the scale of the problem remains substantial, raising questions about the effectiveness of the current response.\nAccording to Which?\u2019s findings, the vast majority (63%) of scams occurred on social media platforms, with 42% of victims reporting fraud via search engines, 39% on online marketplaces, and 23% through messaging services. The most common platforms for scams were Facebook (37%), Google (33%), Instagram (20%), Amazon (18%), and WhatsApp (18%).\nWhich? surveyed over 2,000 UK adults to determine whether the charter has had an impact on the number of scams consumers encounter on online platforms and whether they feel safer online in the year since the initiative began.\nNearly 73% of UK adults expressed distrust in the ads they encounter on social media and search engines, while a third (34%) reported feeling less confident in using online platforms compared to a year ago.

The government and regulators need to act urgently to tackle the fraud epidemic or risk millions more falling victim to scammers.\u201d\nStory continues\nThe Online Safety Act, which is set to hold online platforms accountable for fraudulent advertising, will not be fully enforced until 2027. Concha argued that this timeline is far too slow, urging regulator Ofcom to implement regulations sooner and for a more coordinated approach across the tech, banking and telecom sectors to address the rising tide of scams.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

          "whole_article": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media.\nThe AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPrivate equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018.

I say that as a compliment. Nobody gets away with charging too much anymore\u2014not in this country, no matter the industry, perhaps even the drug industry. It\u2019s happening now, it\u2019s happening fast, and many companies are being left behind by the change. I see it everywhere I go\u2014in the grocery store, online, in the mall, and, of course, in the stock market.\u201d\nCramer talked about how restaurants that offer cheaper but quality meals are seeing a surge in their stock prices amid rising revenues. He also discussed how weight-loss drugs are impacting companies that sell alcohol products.\n\u201cAmerican people are tired of paying up. They feel gou, they feel betrayed, they feel that the only thing about brand loyalty is that it isn\u2019t worth a dime. They want a better deal. They\u2019ll eagerly switch lifetime habits in order to save some money because prices are up so much that you feel like an idiot if you\u2019re paying up.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about.

Cramer said he agrees with the analyst.\nStory Continues\nMichael Nathanson said the following about Meta Platforms\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0in a latest interview with CNBC:\n\u201cMeta, their core business is really getting the benefit of AI. You see it in their ad numbers; they\u2019re accelerating. Their engagement is doing really, really well, so they definitely have momentum behind their business. And they\u2019ve beat our numbers all year long.\u201d\nDespite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\nAccording to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta\u2019s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), the world\u2019s largest social network, were up this quarter, due to impressive top-line growth of 22% year-over-year and solid forward guidance. Despite its large scale, Meta continues to outgrow the broader digital advertising industry, with better AI-driven content recommendations increasing engagement in products like Instagram Reels, and AI improving ad targeting and conversion rates. Our industry checks have continued to validate advertiser adoption and satisfaction, with improvements in Reels monetization, as well as strong adoption of Advantage+, Meta\u2019s AI-driven service to allocate advertiser budgets across its content surfaces.\nOverall, META ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's latest stock picks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nTechnology giants in the United States have pledged tens of billions towards building AI data centers in the next few years. These announcements have served to bolster the hype around companies that build data centers. For example, Crusoe Energy, a startup building data centers for large AI firms, plans to raise more than $800 million in funding, per regulatory filings. The filings detail that the company has already raised close to $685 million of the $818 million in total that it is seeking, with seventy investors contributing to the funding. Crusoe is one of many crypto-origin firms that have pivoted to AI in recent months.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nA report by consulting firm McKinsey reveals that global demand for data center capacity could rise at an annual rate of between 19%-22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts. McKinsey analysis suggests that demand for AI-ready data center capacity will rise at an average rate of 33% a year between 2023 and 2030 in a midrange scenario. Per the consulting firm, this means that around 70% of total demand for data center capacity will be for data centers equipped to host advanced-AI workloads by 2030. Gen AI, currently the fastest-growing advanced-AI use case, will account for around 40 percent of the total, the report underlines.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks on the list.\nWith the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least.\nNaturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled \u2018Global Strategy Paper No. 71,\u00a0 the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This \u2018concentration\u2019 refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence.\nSince the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street\u2019s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos\u2019 eCommerce company, and the world\u2019s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns.\nAs per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index \u201cby an annualized 200 bp-800 bp\u201d over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today\u2019s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI\u2019s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang\u2019s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade.\nGS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market\u2019s performance of the two indexes before the bubble\u2019s \u2018pop\u2019 to point out that \u201cthe trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).\u201d This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall \u201chas been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.\u201d\nStory Continues\nLinking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this \u201cextreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.\u201d Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then \u201cthis would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.\u201d\nWhile stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk\u2019s car company record stunning gains. Goldman\u2019s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that \u201cthe biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.\u201d He shared that \u201cany sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.\u201d These include \u201cenergy, traditional energy versus renewables\u201d with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%.\nTuteja added that \u201cthe resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election\u201d was a standout from the market\u2019s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that \u201cwhat I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.\u201d This is because \u201cit takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.\u201d According to him, in 2016, \u201cregional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.\u201d Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that \u201cunder the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime\u2019s policies.\u201d\nFor some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now.\nWithin this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024\u2019s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings \u201cgrowth alone can explain 40% of next quarter\u2019s cash spending growth.\u201d\nJust like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the \u201ctypical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.\u201d Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects \u201ccash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,\u201d but cautions that \u201cthe potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 top growth investment stocks, we used the bank\u2019s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm\u2019s cash flow from operations.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:META)\nGrowth Investment Ratio: 83%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the world\u2019s biggest social media company. Courtesy of its social media network Facebook, the firm can boast about having a whopping 3.2 billion users under its wing. This massive user base is also at the center of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s hypothesis. It makes the firm indispensable to advertisers who have no choice but to run ads on its platform if they want to capture sizable users. The scale has enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to amass significant resources, as evident through its $156 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue and $43.9 billion in cash and equivalent. The firm has used these to create a foothold in the AI industry by developing the Llama foundational AI model. Unlike other big tech players which are gearing their AI products towards cloud computing, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is targeting everyday consumers and advertisers on its platform. The billions it has invested in AI means that investors are on the watch-out for profit generation.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMeta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks 26th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by Meta Platforms Inc., leaving it to face a multibillion-dollar lawsuit that accuses the company of misleading shareholders about the data-harvesting scandal involving political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future\nIn Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women\u2019s Sports Takes the Field\nNYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge\nNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes\nRecord NYC Thanksgiving Travel Signals Airport, Traffic Mess\nInvestors claim the company, then known as Facebook, inflated share prices through misleading disclosures about the risk of the scandal leading to the misuse of user data. The shareholders say revelations about the breach eventually contributed to two 2018 price drops that cost the company more than $200 billion in market value.\nMeta was seeking reversal of a federal appeals court decision that had let the lawsuit go forward. The Supreme Court agreed to consider the appeal in June and heard arguments on Nov. 6.\nThe court occasionally drops cases after argument. As is its usual practice, the court provided no explanation, saying only that the case was being \u201cdismissed as improvidently granted.\u201d\nThe dismissal makes it more likely Meta will face a costly settlement \u2014 potentially as large as $2 billion \u2014 according to Matthew Schettenhelm, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. A Meta victory at the Supreme Court would have knocked out some though not all of the case against the company.\n\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,\u201d Meta said in a statement. \u201cWe are disappointed in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to clarify this part of the law.\u201d\nThe attorney for the investors, Kevin Russell, declined to comment.\nThe case more broadly had the potential to reset the legal rules governing corporate disclosure. Business groups led by the Chamber of Commerce had urged the court to side with Meta, saying that risk-disclosure allegations have contributed to a wave of meritless securities-fraud suits.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission since 2005 has required companies to disclose material factors that would make an investment risky.\nThe Supreme Court is also considering an appeal by AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp., which is being sued for allegedly misleading shareholders about its reliance on crypto-mining revenue in the run-up to a market crash.\nStory Continues\nCambridge Analytica\nThe first hint of the Cambridge Analytica controversy came in December 2015, when The Guardian reported that the British firm was using a database of information gleaned from Facebook users to help the presidential primary campaign of Senator Ted Cruz. At the time, Facebook said it was investigating.\nThe suing shareholders say Facebook quickly concluded that Cambridge Analytica had obtained the private information of more than 30 million users without their consent.\nBut the shareholders say the company publicly characterized the risk of a breach as hypothetical and didn\u2019t change that stance until March 2018, when it issued a statement to preempt more far-reaching stories in The New York Times and The Guardian. The investors say those revelations caused the share price to plunge.\nThe shareholders say the company\u2019s inadequate disclosures also contributed to a July 2018 stock plunge that at the time was the largest one-day drop in value in US history.\nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the allegations were sufficient to let the lawsuit go forward.\nMeta said it had no reason to think the scandal would harm the company because details had already been published without any impact on the stock price. Meta said the 9th Circuit\u2019s reasoning would require companies to disclose risks that occurred years earlier even if they don\u2019t pose any known current threat of business harm.\nThe Biden administration backed the shareholders at the Supreme Court.\nThe case is Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, 23-980.\n(Updates with analyst, Meta reaction starting in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nClear\u2019s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End\nAn Airline\u2019s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare\nAmazon\u2019s Black Friday NFL Game Is a Play to Keep You Paying for Prime\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "By John Kruzel\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court sidestepped on Friday a decision on whether to allow shareholders to proceed with a securities fraud lawsuit accusing Meta's Facebook of misleading investors about the misuse of the social media platform's user data.\nThe justices, who heard arguments in the case on Nov. 6, dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court's ruling that allowed a 2018 class action led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed. The Supreme Court opted not to resolve the underlying legal dispute, determining that the case should not have been taken up. Its action leaves the lower court's decision in place.\nThe court's dismissal came in a one-line order that provided no explanation.\nThe Facebook dispute was one of two cases to come before the Supreme Court this month involving the right of private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud. The other one, involving the artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, was argued on Nov. 13. The Supreme Court has not ruled yet in the Nvidia case.\nThe plaintiffs in the Facebook case claimed the company unlawfully withheld information from investors about a 2015 data breach involving British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica that affected more than 30 million Facebook users. They accused Facebook of misleading investors in violation of the Securities Exchange Act, a 1934 federal law that requires publicly traded companies to disclose their business risks.\nFacebook's stock fell following 2018 media reports that Cambridge Analytica had used improperly harvested Facebook user data in connection with Donald Trump's successful U.S. presidential campaign in 2016. The investors have sought unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Facebook stock they held.\nAt issue was whether Facebook broke the law when it failed to detail the prior data breach in subsequent business-risk disclosures, and instead portrayed the risk of such incidents as purely hypothetical.\nFacebook spokesperson Andy Stone expressed disappointment \"in the Supreme Court's decision not to clarify this part of the law.\"\n\"The plaintiff's claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,\" Stone said.\nFacebook argued that it was not required to reveal that its warned-of risk had already materialized because \"a reasonable investor\" would understand risk disclosures to be forward-looking statements.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration supported the shareholders in the case.\nStory Continues\nU.S. District Judge Edward Davila dismissed the lawsuit but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived it, prompting Facebook's appeal to the Supreme Court.\nGeorge Washington University law professor Alan Morrison said that following the Supreme Court's dismissal of Facebook's appeal, the plaintiffs would be expected to seek discovery, a process that involves the exchange of information among parties in a case. Morrison added that Facebook \"might renew their motion to dismiss under a somewhat different standard - partially for purposes of delay.\"\nThe Cambridge Analytica data breach prompted U.S. government investigations into Facebook's privacy practices, various lawsuits and a U.S. congressional hearing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 brought an enforcement action against Facebook over the matter, which the company settled for $100 million. Facebook paid a separate $5 billion penalty to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the issue.\nThe Supreme Court in prior rulings has limited the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that polices securities fraud.\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\nWarren Buffett has cemented his legacy as Wall Street\u2019s most successful investor. During the high-flying stock market of the 1960s, he leveraged his investment partnership to acquire\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling New England textile company at the time. Today, the firm is a vastly different entity, boasting a diverse range of businesses from Geico insurance to BNSF Railway, an equity portfolio exceeding $266 billion, and an enormous cash reserve of $325.2 billion. Decades of strong returns have built Buffett\u2019s unmatched track record. Since he took over in 1965, the company\u2019s shares have delivered an annualized gain of 19.8%.\nBuffett has famously stated that his ideal holding period for a stock is \u201cforever\u201d. True to his word, the Oracle of Omaha has held onto some of his favorite stocks for the long haul, allowing them to deliver steady share performance and generate passive income for his portfolio over time. Moreover, market analysts and investors alike have consistently praised Buffett\u2019s disciplined, long-term approach to investing, more so now that his firm has become the latest non-tech firm to surpass a $1 trillion market cap, highlighting Buffett\u2019s stock-picking abilities.\nHowever, despite strong market performance through much of 2024, Buffett seems to have adopted a more defensive stance. Concerned about inflated valuations amid high interest rates and worsening economic conditions, he has offloaded significant holdings in companies whose valuations have surged too high. Billionaire investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital echoed this in his hedge fund\u2019s quarterly letter, noting Buffett\u2019s cautious approach:\n\u201cOne could argue that sitting out bear markets has been the underappreciated reason for his outstanding long-term returns. It is therefore noteworthy to observe that Mr. Buffett is again selling large swaths of his stock portfolio and building enormous cash reserves.\u201d\nOver the past two years, Buffett has been an active net seller of stocks. His firm offloaded a total of $36.1 billion in stocks during the third quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter in which Berkshire was a net seller of equities. At the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett mentioned the possibility of a future rise in the corporate tax rate.\nMoreover, in his 2023 letter, Buffett also addresses common questions about Berkshire, including whether the company can continue to achieve the same level of outperformance as in the past:\nStory Continues\n\u201cThere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can\u2019t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance. Nevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive side, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs Apple Inc. (AAPL) Still a Key Fixture in Warren Buffett\u2019s Portfolio?\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a global leader in consumer electronics has been a key fixture in Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio for several years. However, recent filings from Berkshire Hathaway revealed that the firm sold approximately $14.34 billion worth of Apple shares in Q3 2024. Despite this, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains Buffett\u2019s top holding, valued at almost $70 billion.\nIn Q3 of FY24, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered one of its best performances in recent years, setting a June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, marking a 5% year-over-year increase. Product revenue grew 2% to $61.8 billion, fueled by the launch of the iPad Pro and iPad Air. Additionally, services revenue hit an all-time high of $24.2 billion, a 14% rise from the previous year.\nOn October 23, UBS reaffirmed its Neutral rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), keeping the price target at $236. The analyst projected that Apple\u2019s September revenue and earnings per share would likely align with their estimates of $94 billion and $1.58, respectively. The iPad segment, though not the primary focus for investors, could deliver a positive surprise.\nDespite the excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) following Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), iPhone sales for the September quarter remained steady, with about 46 million units sold year over year. Factoring in an additional 5 million units for iPhone channel fill, the total forecast for iPhone sales reaches 51 million units, with revenue from iPhones estimated at $45.7 billion.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cYou probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire\u2019s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett\u2019s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire\u2019s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\u201d\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "2025 could prove to be one of the most transformative years on record for the space economy.\nBetween Elon Musk\u2019s close ties with the incoming president, a new administration that is expected to be strongly pro-growth and anti-regulation, and the emergence of Starship, a rapidly reusable rocket that will shake up all the givens of accessing orbit, we are on the verge of significant changes that accelerate the growth of the space economy.\nThere are pros and cons to these upcoming changes. On the one hand, a more pro-growth administration will reduce and simplify the abundance of federal and local regulations that hamper new launch and development efforts and increase the costs for businesses. It could also lead to even more privatization of US space operations and greater federal funding support for space companies developing dual-use technologies. On the other hand, strong deregulation could prioritize growth over environmental protections. It could also pose challenges to the Earth observation sector and other climate monitoring technology.\nAnother key question is how much more dominant will SpaceX become in the next four years? The company is already the apex player in launch (the modern space economy wouldn\u2019t even exist without the Falcon 9), so will its few competitors be innovative and strategic enough to keep up with the major growth that is coming?\nMusk\u2019s close ties to the president-elect are only part of the equation here. The arrival of Starship will have a monumental impact on the space economy by accelerating growth in existing markets, enabling entirely new industries, and making existing infrastructure obsolete.\nAs we look ahead, here are 10 predictions for the space capital markets in 2025.\nSpaceX's mega rocket Starship lifts off for a test flight from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n1. The next four years\nUnder the new administration, expect an even greater focus on promoting the space economy and on commercial space integration into government programs. Given Musk\u2019s role in the administration and as one of the largest donors of the campaign, SpaceX will be the greatest beneficiary, but others will benefit as well, most notably from a light-touch regulatory regime for novel space activities overseen by the Commerce.\n2. Starship comes online\nStarship will reach orbit and begin operational flights in the first half of 2025, carrying Starlink V2 satellites. With its rapidly accelerating test program reaching a nearly monthly launch cadence in 2024, Starship will double its flight rate in 2025, aided by less regulatory resistance from the FAA, which Musk will have influence over in his new role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\nStory Continues\nThis vehicle will usher in the next phase of the space economy by significantly reducing the cost and complexity of payload missions; opening the door to crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, as well as lunar development; and setting the stage for emerging industries ranging from orbital habitats and manufacturing platforms to point-to-point travel and extended stay tourism in orbit and beyond.\n3. Mars or bust\nExpect an acceleration of plans for a crewed landing on Mars using primarily SpaceX/Starship architecture, unlike the more complicated NASA-led architecture for Artemis. Support for Artemis will likely continue but will be accompanied by a major review and reconsideration of architecture.\nFor example, a significant number of major programs, such as SLS, Orion, and ML2 are over budget, behind schedule, and/or otherwise troubled. However, any changes to SLS would likely cause domestic headaches, particularly at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., which supports 24,000 jobs and manages the SLS program. Additionally, the Gateway was designed to accommodate international collaboration in the Artemis program but with an America-first approach, and this approach could find less support.\n4. More competition for SpaceX despite a direct line to the White House\nAlthough SpaceX holds a dominant position in launch and satellite internet, 2025 will see competition emerge from several key players. Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) Project Kuiper will begin operations next year, which poses the single greatest threat to Starlink\u2019s market dominance. Direct-to-device connectivity will come online in 2025, with Starlink V2 and Apple (AAPL) moving to improve space-based communications for iPhones with a $1.7 billion investment in GlobalStar and AST SpaceMobile delivering for telecom partners like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ).\nStarlink will also see increased global competition from the Chinese G60/Thousand Sails constellation, which will see half of its first phase launched in 2025. New launch vehicles will also come online next year, including Rocket Lab\u2019s (RKLB) Neutron and Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn. These will pose a direct challenge to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, although Starship is poised to move the goalposts and supersede them.\n5. Space Superiority\nGeopolitical strains continue to fuel an increase in US Defense spending, with benefits for the US Space Force (USSF), which will be accelerated under the new administration. We expect this to show up most clearly in Resilient Global Positioning Systems (R-GPS) and Alternative Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (AltPNT) as conflicts continue and China\u2019s BeiDou continues to displace GPS in aligned countries.\nThrough Starshield, the USSF will increasingly rely on SpaceX for national security missions across GPS, geospatial intelligence, satellite communications (SatCom), space domain awareness, in-space transportation, and more. The establishment of a Space National Guard is inevitable under the new administration and will further expand public-commercial alliances and technology integrations.\n6. Incumbents adjust to the new world order\nIn 2025, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (AIR.PA) will sell off their space businesses after failing to keep up with the pace of change. These divestitures by entrenched government contractors mark a pivotal moment in the space economy, as it changes the competitive landscape, establishes a new power broker system, and creates new opportunities and risks in the government\u2019s extended capabilities in space.\nMeanwhile, expect an acceleration in SatCom M&A as leading incumbents \u2014 such as SES (SES) and Intelsat (combined in 2024), DirectTV and Dish (2024), Viasat and Inmarsat (2023), Eutelsat and OneWeb (2023) \u2014 push for greater consolidation to better compete with Starlink and other new non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) entrants.\n7. Connecting the digital and physical worlds\nOver the next year, artificial intelligence will continue to transform capabilities across the space economy, but it will be most prevalent in \u201cspatial intelligence\u201d as it facilitates the integration of geospatial data into Big Tech.\nThe successful integration of MapBox with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT search is just one early example of the possibilities evolving in this marketplace. World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, has raised $230 million to develop spatially intelligent large world models (LWMs) that can understand and reason about the 3D world from images and other modalities.\nCompanies are already in a race to automate systems that enable proliferated architecture, and AI is the only real solution to the bottleneck. Expect these efforts to accelerate dramatically in 2025, particularly due to stronger federal support for Big Tech and AI innovation as the next administration looks to increase its lead over China.\n8. Coordination of orbital traffic goes from elective to essential\nWhile China has launched a lot of rockets to date, it still only comprises a small percentage of the total global mass to orbit. Expect that to change in 2025 as Chinese mega-constellations like G60, Geely, and more begin to launch in earnest. The exponential growth in satellites in orbit (currently faster than Moore\u2019s Law) will force the conversation of coordination despite geopolitical tensions.\nDue to the US government\u2019s restrictions on direct collaboration with China, these efforts will be led by private industry. This will create a new wave of privatization in space traffic coordination and there is a strong probability that the Commerce Department\u2019s Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS) program will either be canceled or significantly restructured to emphasize commercial data.\n9. Political climate\nUnder the next administration, the US is about to make a sharp turn on climate policy, which will have negative impacts on certain environmental protections and new efforts by geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) companies to improve climate monitoring and solutions.\nThe biggest risks for the GEOINT industry are a reduction in federal funding and specific programs, like NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and NOAA\u2019s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) programs, as well as an overall challenge (and perhaps dismantling) of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incentives for businesses and investors.\nAt the same time, extreme weather events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires will become increasingly frequent, impacting more people and further straining insurance markets. Private capital will have to step up to continue to fund energy transition and climate projects, like MethaneSAT and FireSAT, in an effort to fill the gap left by cuts in climate change and civil Earth observation programs by the new administration.\nHurricane Milton is seen off the coast of Yucatan Peninsula on Oct. 8, 2024, from the International Space Station as it orbited 257 miles above. (NASA via Getty Images) \u00b7 NASA via Getty Images\n10. Play stations\nWhoever buys Boeing\u2019s International Space Station (ISS) operations business will continue their push for an extension of the ISS beyond 2030. Meanwhile, Vast will launch its Haven station in 2025, providing an exit option for a government program that is underfunded and unwanted. The current administration has already been rethinking its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program (CLD), and that skepticism is likely to intensify in the next administration.\nThe reality is that space stations are extremely costly and difficult to maintain, and Starship provides an effective alternative that checks a number of key boxes: It's less expensive, easier and faster to launch and become operational, and you can have multiple stations for less than the cost of one ISS today. Between the practicality of Starship and Musk\u2019s influence in the White House, there is a strong possibility that space stations will become another SpaceX domain.\nWhile the last decade has seen remarkable progress in the space economy, the next four years will experience many dramatic changes \u2014 beginning with a rapid phaseout of incumbents and new political priorities in 2025.\nThe space economy is poised for a surge in growth and development that will be fueled by deregulation and enhanced US defense spending, but the disruptive effects of Starship, as well as SpaceX\u2019s growing influence over federal policy, will have far-reaching impacts across many space industries.\nChad Anderson is the managing partner of Space Capital and an investor in SpaceX, along with dozens of other space companies. Between 2019 and 2021, Anderson went to the White House on a quarterly basis to provide data on the space economy, and he also joined National Space Council meetings, so he has insights on how the next administration will move forward on space.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\nView our latest analysis for Apple\nApple Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nIn fact, the recent sale by Arthur Levinson was the biggest sale of Apple shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$230). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 4.5% of Arthur Levinson's stake.\nApple insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\nNasdaqGS:AAPL Insider Trading Volume November 23rd 2024\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nApple Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Apple. In total, insiders sold US$46m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nInsider Ownership\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Apple insiders own 0.06% of the company, currently worth about US$2.1b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Apple Insiders?\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Apple. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Apple and understanding these should be part of your investment process.\nBut note: Apple may not be the best stock to buy.

          "whole_article": "More than 6 million UK consumers have fallen prey to online fraudsters in the past year, with social media platforms and online marketplaces emerging as the most frequent avenues for scams, according to consumer watchdog Which?.\nFigures reveal that approximately 6.6 million British shoppers have lost money to scams over the last 12 months, with nearly 5 million of those affected being targeted on popular platforms such as Facebook (META), Instagram, YouTube (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and WhatsApp.\nThese platforms, alongside others like TikTok, Google, and X (formerly Twitter), have been rife with scams that continue to affect millions of users.\nRead more: UK consumer confidence rises after budget and US election\nThe report comes as the UK government\u2019s voluntary Online Fraud Charter marks its first anniversary. The charter, signed by major tech companies, aimed to combat online fraud by introducing a series of protective measures, including the verification of new advertisers and the swift removal of fraudulent content. However, despite these commitments, the scale of the problem remains substantial, raising questions about the effectiveness of the current response.\nAccording to Which?\u2019s findings, the vast majority (63%) of scams occurred on social media platforms, with 42% of victims reporting fraud via search engines, 39% on online marketplaces, and 23% through messaging services. The most common platforms for scams were Facebook (37%), Google (33%), Instagram (20%), Amazon (18%), and WhatsApp (18%).\nWhich? surveyed over 2,000 UK adults to determine whether the charter has had an impact on the number of scams consumers encounter on online platforms and whether they feel safer online in the year since the initiative began.\nNearly 73% of UK adults expressed distrust in the ads they encounter on social media and search engines, while a third (34%) reported feeling less confident in using online platforms compared to a year ago. Only 3% said they felt more secure.\nRead more: Best savings accounts that offer above-inflation rates\nThe continuing prevalence of scams has left consumers increasingly anxious, with 22% of respondents encountering suspicious ads or messages every day over the last six months.\nRocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: \u201cFor every week the government fails to take action, we lose millions to fraudsters and organised crime groups \u2013 taking money from productive firms, reducing overall levels of investment in the UK economy and damaging consumer confidence. The government and regulators need to act urgently to tackle the fraud epidemic or risk millions more falling victim to scammers.\u201d\nStory continues\nThe Online Safety Act, which is set to hold online platforms accountable for fraudulent advertising, will not be fully enforced until 2027. Concha argued that this timeline is far too slow, urging regulator Ofcom to implement regulations sooner and for a more coordinated approach across the tech, banking and telecom sectors to address the rising tide of scams.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media.\nThe AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPrivate equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street.\nData centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "2025 could prove to be one of the most transformative years on record for the space economy.\nBetween Elon Musk\u2019s close ties with the incoming president, a new administration that is expected to be strongly pro-growth and anti-regulation, and the emergence of Starship, a rapidly reusable rocket that will shake up all the givens of accessing orbit, we are on the verge of significant changes that accelerate the growth of the space economy.\nThere are pros and cons to these upcoming changes. On the one hand, a more pro-growth administration will reduce and simplify the abundance of federal and local regulations that hamper new launch and development efforts and increase the costs for businesses. It could also lead to even more privatization of US space operations and greater federal funding support for space companies developing dual-use technologies. On the other hand, strong deregulation could prioritize growth over environmental protections. It could also pose challenges to the Earth observation sector and other climate monitoring technology.\nAnother key question is how much more dominant will SpaceX become in the next four years? The company is already the apex player in launch (the modern space economy wouldn\u2019t even exist without the Falcon 9), so will its few competitors be innovative and strategic enough to keep up with the major growth that is coming?\nMusk\u2019s close ties to the president-elect are only part of the equation here. The arrival of Starship will have a monumental impact on the space economy by accelerating growth in existing markets, enabling entirely new industries, and making existing infrastructure obsolete.\nAs we look ahead, here are 10 predictions for the space capital markets in 2025.\nSpaceX's mega rocket Starship lifts off for a test flight from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n1. The next four years\nUnder the new administration, expect an even greater focus on promoting the space economy and on commercial space integration into government programs. Given Musk\u2019s role in the administration and as one of the largest donors of the campaign, SpaceX will be the greatest beneficiary, but others will benefit as well, most notably from a light-touch regulatory regime for novel space activities overseen by the Commerce.\n2. Starship comes online\nStarship will reach orbit and begin operational flights in the first half of 2025, carrying Starlink V2 satellites. With its rapidly accelerating test program reaching a nearly monthly launch cadence in 2024, Starship will double its flight rate in 2025, aided by less regulatory resistance from the FAA, which Musk will have influence over in his new role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\nStory Continues\nThis vehicle will usher in the next phase of the space economy by significantly reducing the cost and complexity of payload missions; opening the door to crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, as well as lunar development; and setting the stage for emerging industries ranging from orbital habitats and manufacturing platforms to point-to-point travel and extended stay tourism in orbit and beyond.\n3. Mars or bust\nExpect an acceleration of plans for a crewed landing on Mars using primarily SpaceX/Starship architecture, unlike the more complicated NASA-led architecture for Artemis. Support for Artemis will likely continue but will be accompanied by a major review and reconsideration of architecture.\nFor example, a significant number of major programs, such as SLS, Orion, and ML2 are over budget, behind schedule, and/or otherwise troubled. However, any changes to SLS would likely cause domestic headaches, particularly at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., which supports 24,000 jobs and manages the SLS program. Additionally, the Gateway was designed to accommodate international collaboration in the Artemis program but with an America-first approach, and this approach could find less support.\n4. More competition for SpaceX despite a direct line to the White House\nAlthough SpaceX holds a dominant position in launch and satellite internet, 2025 will see competition emerge from several key players. Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) Project Kuiper will begin operations next year, which poses the single greatest threat to Starlink\u2019s market dominance. Direct-to-device connectivity will come online in 2025, with Starlink V2 and Apple (AAPL) moving to improve space-based communications for iPhones with a $1.7 billion investment in GlobalStar and AST SpaceMobile delivering for telecom partners like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ).\nStarlink will also see increased global competition from the Chinese G60/Thousand Sails constellation, which will see half of its first phase launched in 2025. New launch vehicles will also come online next year, including Rocket Lab\u2019s (RKLB) Neutron and Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn. These will pose a direct challenge to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, although Starship is poised to move the goalposts and supersede them.\n5. Space Superiority\nGeopolitical strains continue to fuel an increase in US Defense spending, with benefits for the US Space Force (USSF), which will be accelerated under the new administration. We expect this to show up most clearly in Resilient Global Positioning Systems (R-GPS) and Alternative Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (AltPNT) as conflicts continue and China\u2019s BeiDou continues to displace GPS in aligned countries.\nThrough Starshield, the USSF will increasingly rely on SpaceX for national security missions across GPS, geospatial intelligence, satellite communications (SatCom), space domain awareness, in-space transportation, and more. The establishment of a Space National Guard is inevitable under the new administration and will further expand public-commercial alliances and technology integrations.\n6. Incumbents adjust to the new world order\nIn 2025, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (AIR.PA) will sell off their space businesses after failing to keep up with the pace of change. These divestitures by entrenched government contractors mark a pivotal moment in the space economy, as it changes the competitive landscape, establishes a new power broker system, and creates new opportunities and risks in the government\u2019s extended capabilities in space.\nMeanwhile, expect an acceleration in SatCom M&A as leading incumbents \u2014 such as SES (SES) and Intelsat (combined in 2024), DirectTV and Dish (2024), Viasat and Inmarsat (2023), Eutelsat and OneWeb (2023) \u2014 push for greater consolidation to better compete with Starlink and other new non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) entrants.\n7. Connecting the digital and physical worlds\nOver the next year, artificial intelligence will continue to transform capabilities across the space economy, but it will be most prevalent in \u201cspatial intelligence\u201d as it facilitates the integration of geospatial data into Big Tech.\nThe successful integration of MapBox with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT search is just one early example of the possibilities evolving in this marketplace. World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, has raised $230 million to develop spatially intelligent large world models (LWMs) that can understand and reason about the 3D world from images and other modalities.\nCompanies are already in a race to automate systems that enable proliferated architecture, and AI is the only real solution to the bottleneck. Expect these efforts to accelerate dramatically in 2025, particularly due to stronger federal support for Big Tech and AI innovation as the next administration looks to increase its lead over China.\n8. Coordination of orbital traffic goes from elective to essential\nWhile China has launched a lot of rockets to date, it still only comprises a small percentage of the total global mass to orbit. Expect that to change in 2025 as Chinese mega-constellations like G60, Geely, and more begin to launch in earnest. The exponential growth in satellites in orbit (currently faster than Moore\u2019s Law) will force the conversation of coordination despite geopolitical tensions.\nDue to the US government\u2019s restrictions on direct collaboration with China, these efforts will be led by private industry. This will create a new wave of privatization in space traffic coordination and there is a strong probability that the Commerce Department\u2019s Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS) program will either be canceled or significantly restructured to emphasize commercial data.\n9. Political climate\nUnder the next administration, the US is about to make a sharp turn on climate policy, which will have negative impacts on certain environmental protections and new efforts by geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) companies to improve climate monitoring and solutions.\nThe biggest risks for the GEOINT industry are a reduction in federal funding and specific programs, like NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and NOAA\u2019s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) programs, as well as an overall challenge (and perhaps dismantling) of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incentives for businesses and investors.\nAt the same time, extreme weather events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires will become increasingly frequent, impacting more people and further straining insurance markets. Private capital will have to step up to continue to fund energy transition and climate projects, like MethaneSAT and FireSAT, in an effort to fill the gap left by cuts in climate change and civil Earth observation programs by the new administration.\nHurricane Milton is seen off the coast of Yucatan Peninsula on Oct. 8, 2024, from the International Space Station as it orbited 257 miles above. (NASA via Getty Images) \u00b7 NASA via Getty Images\n10. Play stations\nWhoever buys Boeing\u2019s International Space Station (ISS) operations business will continue their push for an extension of the ISS beyond 2030. Meanwhile, Vast will launch its Haven station in 2025, providing an exit option for a government program that is underfunded and unwanted. The current administration has already been rethinking its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program (CLD), and that skepticism is likely to intensify in the next administration.\nThe reality is that space stations are extremely costly and difficult to maintain, and Starship provides an effective alternative that checks a number of key boxes: It's less expensive, easier and faster to launch and become operational, and you can have multiple stations for less than the cost of one ISS today. Between the practicality of Starship and Musk\u2019s influence in the White House, there is a strong possibility that space stations will become another SpaceX domain.\nWhile the last decade has seen remarkable progress in the space economy, the next four years will experience many dramatic changes \u2014 beginning with a rapid phaseout of incumbents and new political priorities in 2025.\nThe space economy is poised for a surge in growth and development that will be fueled by deregulation and enhanced US defense spending, but the disruptive effects of Starship, as well as SpaceX\u2019s growing influence over federal policy, will have far-reaching impacts across many space industries.\nChad Anderson is the managing partner of Space Capital and an investor in SpaceX, along with dozens of other space companies. Between 2019 and 2021, Anderson went to the White House on a quarterly basis to provide data on the space economy, and he also joined National Space Council meetings, so he has insights on how the next administration will move forward on space.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nJefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a \"breakthrough\" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.\nBofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, \"Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory.

These companies have millions of digital customers\u2014and billions of interactions with them. They are using the insights from this data to rapidly optimize each customer\u2019s next experience.\nIn the age of artificial intelligence, competitive advantage is increasingly determined by a company's ability to deliver personalized experiences at scale. We call this phenomenon the \u201cpersonalization advantage,\u201d which can be expressed by a simple formula:\nP = n \u00d7 v2\nP represents the competitive advantage of personalization.\nN is the volume of interactions from which the company can learn.\nV is the speed of learning, which has an exponential impact.\nThe Personalization Advantage formula illustrates why these companies are winning: they have both scale (n) in terms of customer interactions and speed (v) in learning from and acting on these interactions.\nPersonalization is not just customization\u2014it\u2019s about using customer data to deliver experiences tailored in real-time, evolving with each interaction. Whether it's a website suggesting products you didn't know you needed based on prior behavior, a call center agent knowing your shopping history with the company, or a sales associate remembering your preferences, the key is scaling these interactions across millions of customers and constantly learning from them.\nPersonalization is creating experiences at scale that get fine-tuned with each successive interaction, empowering customers to get what they want better, faster, cheaper, or more easily. The difference lies in the way personalized communications build on everything the company learns about the customer over time, and about how other customers like them behave. In our experience across industries and consumer contexts, this is what makes personalization truly effective. This effectiveness is directly linked to the Personalization Advantage formula. The more interactions a company has (n), and the faster it can learn from them (v), the greater its personalization advantage (P) becomes.\nIt is enabled by the many different forms of AI available: machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and others, often combined together. Business is now effectively at the point where competitive advantage will be based on a company\u2019s ability to relentlessly capture, analyze, and utilize customer data, at a massive scale, with every possible contact\u2014and on how it uses that data to understand, shape, personalize, and optimize each customer\u2019s journey.\nStory Continues\nBuilding economies of scale has always been important in business, especially in the physical aspects of competition: supply chains, production, and distribution. However, personalization changes the nature of scale in the customer experience from the mass production of goods to the mass delivery of 1:1 experiences built on accumulated intelligence. Personalization at scale, and the ongoing cycle of experimentation and learning that power it, create a competitive moat that is very hard to replicate. This competitive moat is precisely what our Personalization Advantage formula quantifies.\nIt\u2019s about scale (n)\nCompanies such as Alipay, Amazon, Tencent, Flipkart, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify have each amassed over 200 million active users. The sheer size of their digital customer base is enormous. They distill insights about these users not just when they transact, but every time they browse or click in a digital channel. But even non-digital native companies are maximizing the \u201csurface area\u201d they have for gathering and using customer information\u2014like an alarm company understanding how homeowners use their touchpads or B2B distributors tracking the frequency and nature of replenishment orders.\nThese companies even know the lifetime value of each new active user they add\u2014and invest accordingly. For example, a large food and beverage company we\u2019ve worked with estimated that each 10 million new digital customer relationships would add $1 billion in incremental revenue.\nIt\u2019s about speed (v)\nUltimately, personalization is about what companies do with the insights about their customers. This is where companies are competing on speed. Speed in getting to know the customer throughout the customer journey, speed in executing based on a trigger about a customer, and speed in constantly improving the experience based on that knowledge. We are big believers in the importance of \u201ctime-based competition,\u201d the concept of competing on the basis of speed. In personalization, it is foundational.\nThe squared term in our formula (v2) emphasizes the outsized impact of speed. Doubling the speed of learning and execution more than doubles the personalization advantage.\nIt is no coincidence that companies across a wide swath of categories, including home improvement, banking, restaurants, grocery, and apparel have publicly announced that personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences are central to their corporate strategy. These companies understand that maximizing both (n) and (v) in the Personalization Advantage formula is crucial for their success.\nBy studying hundreds of personalization leaders over the past decade, we have even quantified the size of the personalization advantage pioneering companies are capturing in terms of growth. Across industries, we find that personalization leaders consistently outgrow laggards. In fact, leaders grow top-line revenues 10 points faster per year than laggards. Taken together, we estimate that by the end of this decade, the personalization leaders, on a combined basis, will capture almost $2 trillion in incremental growth.\nThe basis of competition has shifted\u2014and the prize for those that rethink their business model accordingly is enormous. But here\u2019s the catch. Our research also finds that only 10% of companies qualify as personalization leaders. Many businesses say they are doing personalization but fail to go beyond basic segmented marketing. They end up sending more spam, generating more calls from complaining customers, and frustrating themselves with slower growth than expected. These laggards are failing to optimize both (n) and (v) in the personalization advantage formula, limiting their growth potential.\nMore must-read\u00a0commentary\u00a0published by\u00a0Fortune:\nShell\u2019s Pyrrhic victory may well set the stage for more corporate climate accountability\nDemis Hassabis-James Manyika: AI will help us understand the very fabric of reality\nI worked with Steve Jobs.

          "whole_article": "Netflix's NFLX transformation from a DVD rental service to a streaming giant is taking another significant leap with its ambitious push into live content. The company's recent successes with events like the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match, which drew 108 million average viewers, demonstrate its potential in the live streaming arena. However, technical challenges during these events raise questions about the platform's readiness for major live programming.\nTechnical Infrastructure Concerns\nNetflix's strategic expansion into live streaming, marked by high-profile events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the $5 billion WWE deal, demonstrates its commitment to diversifying content offerings beyond traditional streaming. However, widespread streaming issues and buffering problems plagued many viewers. These technical difficulties are particularly concerning as the company prepares for even bigger events, including two NFL Christmas Day games and the upcoming launch of WWE's Monday Night Raw in 2025.\n\nThe platform's ability to handle large-scale concurrent streaming remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed. Despite these short-term hurdles, Netflix's strong market position, growing advertising business and comprehensive entertainment strategy suggest long-term potential. However, given the significant investments required and execution risks in live programming, investors might benefit from waiting for stronger evidence of successful implementation before increasing exposure.\nStrategic Content Acquisitions\nNetflix's $5 billion deal with WWE for Monday Night Raw represents a significant investment in live programming. Combined with NFL games and special events featuring major entertainers like Beyonc\u00e9, the company is positioning itself as a comprehensive entertainment destination. This diversification strategy could help Netflix maintain its competitive edge in an increasingly crowded streaming landscape.\n\nNetflix expects paid net additions to be higher sequentially in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects substantial growth in paid subscribers, with total paid memberships expected to reach 290.54 million by the end of 2024, indicating an 11.6% year-over-year increase.\nFinancial Implications and Growth Prospects\nThe company expects revenues to grow in the range of 11-13% in 2025, reaching $43-$44 billion. This growth rate represents a slowdown from the 15% expected in 2024. Netflix's investment in live content and infrastructure improvements may pressure margins in the short term, though management targets a 28% operating margin for 2025.\n\nWith total debt reaching $15.98 billion and streaming content obligations at $22.7 billion, Netflix faces significant financial commitments.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $38.91 billion, indicating 15.37% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $19.78 per share, indicating a substantial 64.42% increase from the previous year.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nThe recent surge in Netflix's stock price has led to expanded valuation multiples, potentially limiting future upside for investors. The company's forward 12-month sales multiple of 8.73 exceeds its five-year median of 6.53, indicating that the stock may be trading at a premium to its historical valuation. Moreover, this multiple surpasses the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward earnings multiple of 3.4, suggesting that Netflix's valuation is stretched relative to its peers.\nPrice-to-Sales (Forward 12 Months)\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMarket Position and Competition\nAs traditional media companies increasingly bundle their services, Netflix is taking a different approach by expanding its standalone offering. The addition of live sports and entertainment could help justify future price increases and reduce churn. However, the technical challenges and high costs associated with live programming present risks.\n\nInvestors have responded enthusiastically to Netflix's performance, with NFLX shares returning an impressive 81.5% year to date, significantly outperforming tech giants like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.\nYear-to-date Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Outlook\nWhile Netflix's push into live streaming shows promise, current investors should maintain their positions but new investors might want to wait for a better entry point. The company needs to prove that it can consistently deliver high-quality live streaming experiences before the market fully prices in this growth opportunity. Additionally, the significant investments required for live content rights and technical infrastructure may impact near-term profitability.\nConclusion\nNetflix's venture into live streaming represents both an opportunity and a challenge. While the strategy could strengthen its market position, technical hurdles and high costs suggest caution. Current shareholders should remain invested to benefit from the company's long-term potential, but new investors might find better entry points after Netflix demonstrates consistent execution in live programming delivery.

A Florida-based person named Ronald Blue Denton sued Netflix in state court for what he considered a shoddy performance in delivering the event to its clients in sharp craving, stating that Netflix was unstoppably ill-equipped for the demand for the show, making it unwatchable.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Netflix violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and breached the parties' contract while also demanding monetary damages and a class action on behalf of other affected Netflix subscribers. According to Denton, Netflix is guilty of abdicating its role as a service provider since it failed to provide a perfect viewing experience for millions of people.\nThe November 15 fight that Netflix promoted as its primary sports event attracted 108 million viewers worldwide. Nonetheless, many people used social networks to complain about the declining video quality, numerous instances of buffering, and completely frozen streams, especially if the moment in the match was important.\nNetflix included the topic as part of a significant milestone in sports streaming to establish its dominance in the live segment. Denton's lawsuit now appears to potentially overshadow the feat and is symbolic of the dangers of mounting highly visible live events when viewer expectations steadily rise.\nThis legal dispute could try Netflix for various technical problems and issue a challenge to how the company plans to handle mass streaming events as it faces increasing competition in live sports rights. As of yet, the company has not said anything about this lawsuit.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The fight was Netflix's most-watched title of the week up through Sunday, with 46.6 million viewers. These numbers are derived from the TVision for US viewers and internal data for distinct viewers internationally.\nAlso, the co-main event with Amanda Serrano vs. Katie Taylor attracted 74 million live viewers from all over the world.

This record-breaking viewership indicates that it is not only the initial days of the sports that can get a high television viewership. It also points towards the fact that the crossover boxing events are gaining popularity.\nAppealing to entertainment with the help of such talents as Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, using the occasion of streaming, Netflix has identified itself as the major rival in the sphere of live sports streaming and broadcasting.

          "whole_article": "In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary.\nBut the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments.\nNancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023.\nThe timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit.\nWell, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices.\nAnd now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s.\nAs this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions.\nNancy Pelosi as Investment Guru?\nLet's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024.\nMaybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer.\nGurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list.\nHer most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price.\nOn the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece.\nStory Continues\nIf our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption.\nAnd after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July.\nAnd look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price!\nMeanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025.\nLooking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies.\nUnlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too.\nBut other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way.

In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPrivate equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018.

However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary.\nBut the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments.\nNancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023.\nThe timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit.\nWell, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices.\nAnd now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s.\nAs this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions.\nNancy Pelosi as Investment Guru?\nLet's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024.\nMaybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer.\nGurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list.\nHer most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price.\nOn the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece.\nStory Continues\nIf our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption.\nAnd after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July.\nAnd look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price!\nMeanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025.\nLooking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies.\nUnlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too.\nBut other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way.

The charter, signed by major tech companies, aimed to combat online fraud by introducing a series of protective measures, including the verification of new advertisers and the swift removal of fraudulent content. However, despite these commitments, the scale of the problem remains substantial, raising questions about the effectiveness of the current response.\nAccording to Which?\u2019s findings, the vast majority (63%) of scams occurred on social media platforms, with 42% of victims reporting fraud via search engines, 39% on online marketplaces, and 23% through messaging services. The most common platforms for scams were Facebook (37%), Google (33%), Instagram (20%), Amazon (18%), and WhatsApp (18%).\nWhich? surveyed over 2,000 UK adults to determine whether the charter has had an impact on the number of scams consumers encounter on online platforms and whether they feel safer online in the year since the initiative began.\nNearly 73% of UK adults expressed distrust in the ads they encounter on social media and search engines, while a third (34%) reported feeling less confident in using online platforms compared to a year ago.

The government and regulators need to act urgently to tackle the fraud epidemic or risk millions more falling victim to scammers.\u201d\nStory continues\nThe Online Safety Act, which is set to hold online platforms accountable for fraudulent advertising, will not be fully enforced until 2027. Concha argued that this timeline is far too slow, urging regulator Ofcom to implement regulations sooner and for a more coordinated approach across the tech, banking and telecom sectors to address the rising tide of scams.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

Musk's bold mission to colonize Mars and \"back up humanity.\" In the interview, Rose referenced past comments Page had made about this idea, asking for clarification.\nDon't Miss:\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg?

So I think, you know, we aim to do kind of similar things.\"\nPage then shifted focus to Google's culture of innovation, adding, \"We have a lot of employees at Google who've become pretty wealthy ... A lot of people in there are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world and you want to make it better. So why isn't the company they work for worthy not just of your time, but your money as well?\"\nFor Page, Musk's ambitious goals aligned with his belief that companies, when run effectively, could drive revolutionary change. He elaborated, saying, \"Lots of companies don't succeed over time. They usually miss the future ... I try to focus on that: What is the future really going to be? And how do we create it?\"\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.26/share\nPage and Musk once shared a close friendship. Musk frequently stayed at Page's house during visits to Silicon Valley and their shared passion for pushing technological boundaries made them natural allies. Their camaraderie landed them on Fortune's 2016 list of \"Business Leaders You Didn't Know Were BFFs.\"\nStory Continues\nMusk even attempted to sell Tesla to Google for $11 billion, according to Ashlee Vance\u2019s biography, \u201cElon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.\u201d The two friends actually both agreed to the deal via handshake, but called it off once Tesla \"no longer needed a savior.\"\nHowever, their relationship reportedly soured around 2013. Musk's growing concerns about the dangers of artificial intelligence clashed with Page's more optimistic outlook. At Musk's birthday party that year, the two had a heated debate about AI. Page allegedly called Musk a \"speciesist\" for prioritizing human interests over other forms of intelligence.\nTrending: This rooftop wind turbine is taking on a market projected to reach over $900 billion by 2032 \u2014 With already over 40,000 users signing up to purchase, here's a chance to be an early investor today!\nThe tension grew after Musk cofounded OpenAI, a nonprofit ensuring AI safety, which was seen as a direct challenge to Google, which had acquired DeepMind, a leading AI company. Musk even tried to dissuade DeepMind's CEO from selling to Google, further straining their relationship.\nBut despite their falling out, Musk has recently desired to mend fences. In a 2023 podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk said, \"I would like to be friends again with Larry. I haven't seen him in ages. We were friends for a very long time.\" However, he acknowledged that Page might not feel the same, noting, \"He doesn't want to talk to me anymore.\"\nLarry Page's 2014 remarks about leaving his fortune to Elon Musk reflect his belief that revolutionary change outweighs incremental progress. While the future of their friendship remains uncertain, both Page and Musk continue to be key players in shaping the future of technology \u2013 and maybe even humanity.\nRead Next:\nStudies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do \u2014 to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor.\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.26/share\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

          "whole_article": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

Trump is expected to turn to one of the two current Republican FTC commissioners to serve as an acting lead for the agency.\n\u201cWith the replacement of Lina Khan, we will see some heavy M&A action kick off even before the Trump administration is sworn in. It will be an interesting time because people are ready to spend and innovate,\u201d said Liz Miller, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department\u2014the other agency that shares antitrust enforcement with the FTC\u2014is likely to move away from recent rhetoric and policies that had a chilling effect on deals, according to industry insiders. \u201cThe Biden administration discouraged lots of transactions by just dragging out the review process and making it longer and expensive,\u201d one industry insider said.\nFor context, Biden\u2019s regulators in 2023 filed a record 50 enforcement actions to fix or block merger transactions. Many blamed Biden\u2019s antitrust zeal with helping slowdown M&A. The number of U.S. announced mergers are running off 34% from 2021, when a record 15,582 deals totaled $2.5 trillion in value, according to data from Dealogic.\n\u201cThe policies advocated by the FTC and the DOJ over the last four years have undoubtedly hampered deal activity and corporates\u2019 willingness to forge into a transaction with the inability to gauge the likelihood of close,\u201d said Michal Katz, head of investment and corporate banking at Mizuho Americas, a division of Mizuho Financial Group.\nBig mergers back on the table?\nOne of the biggest deals that fell by the wayside due to regulatory interference was Nvidia\u2019s $40 billion offer to buy Arm, which was announced in September 2020 while Trump was still in office. It was Biden\u2019s FTC that sued to stop the chip merger in December 2021, leading Nvidia to call off the deal months later, in 2022. There is little chance that Nvidia will ever buy the chip designer now. Arm went public in fall 2023 and is currently worth about $145 billion.\nStory Continues\nSome deals still went forward despite regulatory opposition. Microsoft offered to buy video game developer Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $68.7 billion. Despite an FTC lawsuit to stop the deal, a federal judge sided with the companies and let the merger go ahead, though the agency is currently appealing the decision.\nWhile blocked deals involving giants like Nvidia made the headlines, Michael Sibarium, a partner at law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, says Biden\u2019s antitrust policies also had a chilling impact on smaller deals. This was the case partly due to prolonged review processes that big businesses like Microsoft can better deal with, while smaller companies may lack the resources, Sibarium said. \u201cIf you are one of the wealthiest companies in the world, you can afford to fight if you want to fight. And you can make it go faster by hiring teams and teams of lawyers.\u201d\nAntitrust law under Trump won't be out the window altogether. During the President-elect\u2019s first term, regulators initiated a number of cases against Big Tech. It was Trump\u2019s DOJ that filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google\u2019s search monopoly, resulting in a landmark ruling against the company this year. Under Trump, regulators also sued Facebook over antitrust and called for a ban on TikTok.\nNearly everyone is expecting deals, including mergers and IPOs, to increase next year. Wall Street already has four years getting used to Trump, Mizuho\u2019s Katz said. While it\u2019s unclear which campaign promises he will keep, Trump is a \u201cknown unknown,\u201d Katz said.\n\u201cWe'll see increased dealmaking activity in [IPOs and mergers] because the election uncertainty has been removed from the equation,\u201d she said.\nFortune set out to discover which deals may get a second chance under Trump 2.0. One private equity executive who invests in tech said many companies \u201cdon\u2019t want to be the guinea pig to try and see what can be approved [under Trump], especially if they have tried once before and failed.\u201d For that reason, we have chosen not to include some deals that were emphatically rejected, like Adobe\u2019s failed buy of Figma, or where companies have clearly signaled a merger is not on the table, such as with Cigna and Humana.\nHere is our list of five super size deal that could get the green light in 2025:\nKroger-Albertson\nIn October 2022, Kroger agreed to buy Albertsons in a $24.6 billion grocery store merger that would combine two rivals in one of the biggest supermarket mergers in history. In February, the FTC sued to block the transaction, alleging the merger would lead to higher prices for groceries and other essential household items. Judges in three separate states\u2014Oregon, Colorado and Washington\u2014are reviewing the case, including one in Seattle who was expected to issue a decision on Nov. 15 but has since delayed.\u00a0 Kroger\u2019s stock has gained about 4% since the Nov. 5 presidential election while Albertsons has increased by about 3%.\nAlphabet-HubSpot\nThere were two possible Google/Alphabet deals this year. In one, Alphabet considered making a $25 billion offer to buy CRM provider HubSpot earlier this year, according to press reports. Negotiations didn\u2019t get to the due diligence phase before Alphabet walked away. In the other, Google held discussions to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion before that deal dissolved. Either deal would've been Google's biggest ever and both risked attracting antitrust scrutiny, which likely contributed to the decision to call off both. Under Trump, scrutiny could get less intense, opening the door for it to snap up Wix or Hubspot. Trump and the GOP, however, have cultural axes to grind with Big Tech, meaning Google could have a harder time than others. Shares of HubSpot, which beat third quarter estimates earlier in November, have rocketed 27% since Nov. 5. Wiz, meanwhile, has said it\u2019s pursuing an IPO.\nQualcomm-Intel\nQualcomm is said to have approached Intel in September about buying the slumping chipmaker. Qualcomm backed off the deal as it waited to see who won the U.S. presidential election, Bloomberg reported. A merger would likely draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators around the world, including the U.S. and China, the story said. Intel\u2019s stock is up about 9% since the election. Intel declined comment.\nTempur Sealy-Mattress Firm\nTempur Sealy, the world\u2019s largest mattress supplier and maker, agreed to buy rival Mattress Firm for $4 billion in May 2023. In July, the FTC voted to block the deal, arguing that the Tempur Sealy will have the \u201cability and incentive to suppress competition and raise prices for mattresses for millions of consumers\u201d once it buys Mattress Firm. In September, Tempur Sealy said it believed a \"successful litigation process can be completed in the coming months\" and expected the deal to close later in 2024 or early 2025. It also agreed to divest some Mattress Firm retail locations and its Sleep Outfitters subsidiary. Tempur Sealy filed a motion in October asking a Texas district court judge for a preliminary injunction that would stop the FTC\u2019s administrative proceeding that is set to begin on Dec. 4. The FTC is also pursuing a federal court case to stop the merger, also in the southern district of Texas, that began on Nov. 11 and is ongoing. Shares of Tempur Sealy have gained more than 11% since the election.\nNippon Steel-U.S. Steel\nThe fate of Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel\u2019s nearly $15 billion buy of U.S. Steel, announced in 2023, is unclear. The Biden administration has said it would block it. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, was reviewing the deal but has yet to issue its final recommendation. The merger has faced significant opposition from Trump, and the United Steelworkers. Eiji Hashimoto, Nippon\u2019s chairman and CEO, told Japanese weekly Shunkan Bunshun on Nov. 13 that he hasn\u2019t ruled out suing the U.S. government if regulators block the acquisition. U.S. Steel\u2019s stock has gained about 6% since Nov. 5 while ADRs for Nippon are up about 2%.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street.\nData centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Europe is an ideal holiday destination thanks to its close proximity, its history, culture and beautiful landscapes and while a European adventure may seem costly, exploring the continent doesn\u2019t need to break the bank.\nThanks to budget airlines, rail passes and a variety of affordable lodging choices, travellers can explore Europe\u2019s highlights without overspending.\nWhether strolling through Paris, island-hopping in Greece, or discovering hidden historic gems in Eastern Europe, there are plenty of ways to travel across Europe on a budget.\nLow-cost airlines: budget-friendly flights across Europe\nTaking advantage of low-cost airlines is one of the easiest ways to travel across Europe affordably. Airlines like Ryanair (RYA.IR), EasyJet (EZJ.L), and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) frequently offer flights between major European cities for as little as \u00a310-\u00a320.\nBooking early can help you maximise savings: Look for deals at least two to three months in advance. Websites like Skyscanner or Kayak can help you find the lowest fares.\nBeing flexible is also important. If you can fly mid-week or at off-peak times (early morning or late at night), you can often secure cheaper tickets. Use tools like Google Flights (GOOG) to explore flexible date options.\nBe careful to watch out for hidden fees though. Budget airlines often charge extra for baggage, seat selection and food. Pack light and travel with only a carry-on to avoid additional costs.\nCheck sites such as AirHelp for information on compensation for delays and cancellations.\nRail passes: Interrail for flexible, affordable travel\nIf you prefer travelling by land, consider the Interrail Global Pass, which allows unlimited train travel across 33 countries in Europe. This pass is excellent for exploring multiple destinations without the hassle of flying.\nTo keep things budget-friendly, consider using overnight trains. They help you save on accommodation since you can sleep while moving between cities. Check Trainline (TRN.L) for schedules and routes.\nSome high-speed trains require reservations, so always check ahead to avoid unexpected costs; you can find reservation details on the Interrail website.\nBudget accommodation: hostels, Airbnb and house-sitting\nAccommodation can be one of the largest expenses when travelling, but there are plenty of ways to save. Modern hostels are a good choice as they offer clean and affordable private rooms.\nWebsites like Hostelworld (HSW.L) feature user reviews to help you find the best options. Of course, Airbnb (ABNB) is many people's preferred option and has a wide presence across Europe. It's worth noting that many governments are increasingly limiting Airbnb lets in some cities to avoid locals being priced out of property, so availability may not be as high as in previous years.\nStory continues\nRead more: How to get the best holiday exchange rates\nRenting a room or apartment can be more affordable than hotels, especially outside the city centre. Use filters where searching on Airbnb to find listings with a kitchen to save on meals.\n'Couch surfing' is another viable choice if you're happy to share your space. The platform allows you to stay with locals for free, offering a unique cultural experience. Sign up and create a profile at Couchsurfing.\nHouse-sitting has become increasingly popular in recent years: Websites like TrustedHousesitters connect you with homeowners looking for someone to care for their pets and home. This can provide free accommodation. Learn more about house-sitting here.\nBest cities for budget travellers\nWhile many European capitals can be pricey, several budget-friendly destinations offer rich experiences for less. Here are our top five picks.\nBudapest, Hungary: Famous for its thermal baths and historic architecture, Budapest offers affordable food, accommodation, and public transport. Explore budget-friendly eateries through Eatwith.\nKrakow, Poland: With historical sites like Wawel Castle and Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial, Krakow is a treasure trove of history at a low cost. Use the Krakow City Card for discounts on attractions.\nLisbon, Portugal: Lisbon\u2019s picturesque views and low-cost food make it a perfect budget destination. Try local dishes at Time Out Market for authentic, affordable dining.\nPrague, Czech Republic: Despite its popularity, Prague remains budget-friendly. Use Prague Free Walking Tours to discover the city by paying what you can.\nValencia, Spain: Valencia boasts stunning beaches and a rich food scene. Check out Mercado Central for local delicacies at reasonable prices.\nTime and plan your visit well\nTo stretch your budget even further, avoiding common tourist traps is a must. Food-wise, you can avoid dining in touristy areas, and venture into local neighbourhoods for cheaper, authentic meals. Use apps like The Fork or Quandoo to find nearby restaurants with deals.\nYou also don't need to splash out on attractions since most cities will have plenty you can access for free. Look for free walking tours, museums with free entry days, and public parks or landmarks.\nRead more: 3 Tips for Using Your Holiday Shopping To Get Credit Card Rewards\nMany places also have free attractions, so check the destination websites.\nFinally, avoid peak seasons if you can. Travelling during summer means higher prices and larger crowds. Aim for the shoulder seasons (spring or autumn) for lower rates and milder weather.\nWebsites like Kayak offer price alerts for different seasons.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

          "whole_article": "In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary.\nBut the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments.\nNancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023.\nThe timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit.\nWell, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices.\nAnd now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s.\nAs this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions.\nNancy Pelosi as Investment Guru?\nLet's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024.\nMaybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer.\nGurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list.\nHer most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price.\nOn the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece.\nStory Continues\nIf our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption.\nAnd after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July.\nAnd look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price!\nMeanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025.\nLooking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies.\nUnlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too.\nBut other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way.

This follows the $25 million seed round it held less than a year ago. The latest round, led by Spark Capital, values the company at a pre-money valuation in the mid-$200 million range and a post-money valuation in the low $300 million range, per TechCrunch.

          "whole_article": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

So, $1,200 / 0.008 = $150,000 to generate an income of $100 per month.\nStory Continues\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock\u2019s current price.\nThe dividend yield can change over time due to fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.\nTrending: The Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. Earn a 1% return boost on your first EquityMultiple investment when you sign up here (accredited investors only).\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).\nIn summary, income-focused investors may find Microsoft stock an attractive option for making a steady income of $100 per month by owning 362 shares of stock. There may be more upside as investors benefit from the company's consistent dividend hikes. Microsoft has raised its dividend consecutively for the last 19 years.\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today.

However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Microsoft's ROE.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Microsoft\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:\n31% = US$91b \u00f7 US$288b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.31 in profit.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nMicrosoft's Earnings Growth And 31% ROE\nTo begin with, Microsoft has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 12% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Microsoft was able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the last five years.\nWe then compared Microsoft's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.\nNasdaqGS:MSFT Past Earnings Growth November 23rd 2024\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is MSFT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\nStory Continues\nIs Microsoft Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\nMicrosoft has a three-year median payout ratio of 26%, which implies that it retains the remaining 74% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.\nBesides, Microsoft has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 22% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 27%.\nConclusion\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Microsoft's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

Analysts forecast revenues of $982.26 million, representing an increase of 25% year over year.\nThe current level reflects no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some CrowdStrike metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- Subscription' of $936.57 million. The estimate suggests a change of +27.7% year over year.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenue- Professional services' stands at $49.04 million. The estimate indicates a change of -6.7% from the prior-year quarter.\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- United States' to reach $682.66 million. The estimate indicates a change of +26.9% from the prior-year quarter.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Annual recurring revenue (ARR)' should arrive at $4,001,747.00. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $3,150,000.\nAnalysts expect 'Non-GAAP subscription gross profit' to come in at $752.42 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $588.69 million.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Non-GAAP professional services gross profit' should come in at $16.57 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $23.02 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'GAAP professional services gross profit' reaching $11.95 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $17.38 million.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'GAAP subscription gross profit' will reach $734.84 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $573.63 million.\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for CrowdStrike here>>>\n\nOver the past month, shares of CrowdStrike have returned +17.4% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +17.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.25 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other trending AI stocks that are making waves today.\nIs artificial intelligence a tool for the rich countries and the wealthy? Even if it is, Chinese President Xi Jinping warns that it shouldn\u2019t be. At the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Xi noted that AI shouldn\u2019t be a game of the affluent, calling on more international governance and cooperation on the matter. In a separate meeting in Peru, Xi and Joe Biden also agreed that human beings, and not artificial intelligence, should be making decisions about nuclear weapons, as reported by The White House.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Stories You Can\u2019t Miss and\u00a015 AI News Making Waves Right Now\nThe call for equitable AI development and responsible decision-making underscores the growing global focus on AI's impact, and all the latest developments being made in the AI realm. As the global race to advance AI accelerates, one country striving to secure its position in this competitive landscape is Japan. The country is reportedly readying a $65-billion push in microchips and artificial intelligence, as revealed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this month. The move comes amid the country\u2019s efforts to reclaim its status as a global tech leader.\nNews like these underscores how artificial intelligence continues to be a dominant theme in the business world. A Cisco 2024 AI Readiness Report reveals how companies around the world realize that the momentum for AI deployment is building fast, pulling up immense pressure on them in the process. However, only 13% of companies are ready to leverage AI and AI-powered technologies to their full potential. This is a 1-point decline from last year. Even though organizations are doing their best to leverage AI, the ROI is nowhere in the picture for many.\nAccording to an AI consultant Rider Harris, some major reasons for companies failing to reap ROIs are that they probably invested in a bad tool, they weren\u2019t trained enough (or at all), there\u2019s a lack of excitement on the fear that AI may take their job away, or there may even be a lack of resources for employees to adequately make use of or navigate those tools. \u00a0This is why focusing on aspects such as training employees, getting them excited about the AI tool, and providing adequate resources can go a long way.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity technology company harnessing artificial intelligence to streamline and strengthen cyber protection.\nOn November 20, Stifel raised the firm\u2019s price target on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) to $375 from $300 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating comes ahead of the company\u2019s Q3 earnings report, scheduled to be released on November 26. Recent checks on the company\u2019s faulty update back in July demonstrate mixed trends. However, the impact of the issue is seen to be fading, and there is growing confidence in the company\u2019s medium-term market opportunities. Despite facing legal action from Delta Airlines, there is optimism around the company\u2019s performance, with growth expectations by the second half of 2026. The company has also formed a strategic partnership with Plurilock Security Inc. to enhance protection for critical infrastructure, leveraging AI-native cybersecurity solution Falcon.\nOverall CRWD ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves right now.\nWith Donald Trump having won the elections, it seems Elon Musk is going to be a powerful force in the administration.\u00a0 After all, X CEO has played an outsized role in his comeback, contributing millions to his campaign, serving as policy advisor, and even using his social media platform as a Make America Great Again (MAGA) advocacy platform.\nNow that his efforts have come to fruition Max Tegmark, a leading scientist, who has previously worked with the world\u2019s richest person says Musk\u2019s influence could lead to tougher safety standards for artificial intelligence, as reported by The Guardian.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Stories Shaking Up Wall Street\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nTegmark says Musk\u2019s backing of a failed AI bill demonstrated that Musk is still worried about the repercussions of uncontrolled AI development. The SB 1047 bill in California required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them.\nHaving frequently warned that such an unrestrained development can be catastrophic for humanity, Musk was one of the 30,000 others who had signed a letter calling for a pause on the development of advanced AI technology last year.\nAccording to Tegmark, Musk could convince Trump to introduce standards that prevent the growth of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a term used for AI systems that match or surpass human levels of intelligence.\n\u201cI do think that if Elon manages to get Trump\u2019s ear on AI issues we\u2019re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI. He might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.\u201d\nBefore Trump won the elections, Musk had predicted the development of artificial intelligence that would be smarter than the smartest human being by next year or by 2026.\n\"If you define AGI (artificial general intelligence) as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably next year, within two years\u201d.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The analyst, rating the stock as part of a broader research note previewing Q3 results for the Infrastructure & Security Software names, notes that buyer behavior has been stabilizing and the firm is focused on visibility into 2025 when generative AI projects will have a \u201crubber meets the road\u201d moment. In particular, the firm believes that Crowdstrike\u2019s recent challenges, especially its global IT outage on July 19th, may lead to lower upsell revenue. There may also be a greater-than-normal decrease in business/ revenue due to longer-than-usual subscription durations following its global IT outage.\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves right now.

Following this incident, the stock took a sharp dive, dropping from $345 to $264 on July 22, as investors reacted to the news.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRWD.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nThe repercussions from the July 19 outage was revealed when the company reported its Q2 FY25 earnings. Despite the outage, the company managed to outperform wall-street analysts' revenue and earnings expectations, leading to a 3% stock price increase following the earnings release. However, with its Q2 FY25 earnings results, management released its lowered top-line and bottom-line guidance for the upcoming quarters. Despite this lowered guidance, the stock largely rebounded, and is now in line with the S&P 500's YTD returns. My long-term investment perspective for CrowdStrike lies on one key trend in cybersecurity: the growing demand from enterprise customers to consolidate multiple-vendor solutions onto a single platform to cut costs. Consequently, the recent macroeconomic pressures have forced enterprise customers to focus on efficiency and find ways to do more with less. Thus, this key trend remains strong and I believe CrowdStrike is well-positioned to benefit, as it provides one of the top platforms in the market at significant cost-savings.\nThe Falcon Platform: One-Stop Shop\nCrowdStrike is basically known as an endpoint protection company in the cybersecurity market, but I don't think this fully captures the scope of services that the company currently offers. In reality, it operates as a one-stop platform for enterprise cybersecurity solutions, which was a key point highlighted during its Q2 FY25 earnings presentation. While there are many competitors in the industry, no other competitor is able to offer the scope of services that CrowdStrike does. Thus, as mentioned previously, I believe that CrowdStrike is positioned well to benefit in a time where enterprises are increasingly looking to consolidate its cybersecurity infrastructure. As a result, CrowdStrike's platform is able to serve as a consolidated solution, which is difficult to compete with in the current cybersecurity landscape.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nGeorge Kurtz (CEO of CrowdStrike) pointed out that enterprise customers are focused on efficiency and reducing complexity, noting that Customers don't want to go backwards and have a patchwork of products. They are still focused on the consolidation piece and they're looking at us as one of the key consolidators in the market\". What was actually meant by this statement is evident in the fact that about 65% of the company's customers use five or more modules, 45% use six or more and 30% use seven or modules. Furthermore, among larger customers that spend over $100,000 annually on CrowdStrike's services, nearly half use eight or more modules. This highlights the depth of the consolidation in CrowdStrike's cybersecurity customer portfolio, making it significantly challenging to compete with.\nFurther, I found a research piece from Gartner that noted that 75% of enterprise customers are actively looking to decrease the number of cybersecurity vendors that they work with, further supporting the industry trend of vendor consolidation. Thus, the primary goal for enterprise customers is to increase integration and lower vendor management costs, and this shift will likely result in a handful of dominant players emerging in the market. Given CrowdStrike's early focus on consolidation through its Falcon platform, it is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.\nPost-Outage Recovery\nPost the outage on July 19, CrowdStrike experienced some disruption in its sales pipeline with a few deals placed on hold, and to be finalized in subsequent quarters. Consequently, management clarified to investors that the larger part of those delayed deals would still stay in the pipeline. That said, investors should be prepared to hear that some of the new customers are going to be more cautious than usual, since the company has lost some trust within the marketplace as a result of the outage. During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, CFO Burt Podbere noted the following: \"We expect to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, with additional scrutiny requiring higher levels of approval at the CEO and, in some cases, Board of Directors level.\" The meaning behind this is simple: the longer the list of approvals, the more protracted the sales cycle will be, especially in large corporations. Although the CFO didn't mention the exact delay periods, I expect bigger deals to take close to six months to finalize.\nTo address the situation, it appears that CrowdStrike has introduced customer commitment packages, wherein the company gives a discount and other incentives to their customers in return for signing longer-term contracts. This may, however, affect the company's revenues for the next few quarters, but it's important to note that CrowdStrike still managed to win several eight and nine-figure deals despite the outage. For example, within cloud security, CrowdStrike secured an eight-figure deal with a major enterprise software firm, which opted to standardize on Falcon Cloud Security across its entire business, replacing another next-gen cloud security vendor. Similarly, a nine-figure cloud security deal saw a large enterprise adopt Falcon Cloud Security across a million hosts, replacing other cloud security products.\nIn the Security information and event management (SIEM) market, CrowdStrike continues to outperform legacy SIEM providers. Two major deals stand out: an eight-figure deal with an existing customer, which replaced two legacy SIEMs with CrowdStrike's LogScale, resulting in over 60% cost savings, and a seven-figure deal with a leading generative AI company, which standardized on LogScale after a year of use, improving search speed, response times, and total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to their previous legacy SIEM solution.\nExpanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)\nCrowdStrike's growth story is further supported by the expanding TAM. In 2024, the TAM for cybersecurity is expected to be around $100 billion, but this figure is projected to grow to $225 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8%. Even if CrowdStrike only manages to grow in line with the market, the company has a long runway for growth. Given its platformization strategy, I believe CrowdStrike is positioned to outpace market growth and capture significant market share.\nStrong Results Despite Challenges\nCrowdStrike's Q2 FY25 results, in my view, basically showcase the company's resilience and strength, even in the face of significant adversity (with the recent outage and macro pressures). The company reported revenue of $964 million (up 31.7% YoY), overperforming wall-street guidance by $5.5 million. With 94% of its revenue coming from subscriptions, the growth in this segment is a key indicator of CrowdStrike's performance. Subscription revenue grew 33% YoY, while ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) was up 32%, reaching $3.9 billion. This included $218 million in net new ARR, an 11% increase YoY, in line with the company's guidance.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[CrowdStrike IR]\nCrowdStrike also reported record non-GAAP operating income of $227 million, representing a 46% YoY increase, signaling excellent operational efficiency. Notably, non-GAAP operating income is growing faster than revenue, demonstrating the company's operating leverage, a key strength in the tech sector, where many companies prioritize growth over profitability.\nRobust Cash Flow Generation\nFree cash flows increased by 44% YoY to $272 million in Q2 FY25, with a 28% free cash flow margin, highlighting the company's ability to fund its own growth. The company achieved what it calls the \"rule of 60\" during the quarter. This means that the sum of its YoY revenue growth rate (approximately 32%) and its free cash flow margin (28%) equals 60. The term is derived from the \"rule of 40,\" a concept introduced by Brad Feld, who describes it as the idea that a company's growth rate combined with its profitability should total at least 40%. For example, a 20% growth rate should correspond with a 20% profit margin, while a 50% growth rate could be paired with a 10% loss. Exceeding this benchmark is rare, which is why investors tend to value CrowdStrike more highly compared to other growth stocks.\nLowered Management Guidance\nAlthough the company reported great Q2 FY25 results despite the outage, the repercussions of the outage is largely reflected in CrowdStrike's full-year guidance. Management lowered its initial revenue guidance for FY25 by 1.5%, now expecting revenue to be between $3.896 billion and $3.989 billion, down from the original forecast of $3.924 billion to $3.989 billion. Non-GAAP operating income guidance was also reduced by 11.23%, with the new midpoint at $788.5 million, down from $888.3 million. While Q3 FY25 is expected to show continued revenue growth of 34.2%, non-GAAP operating income growth is forecasted to slow to 8.3%, reflecting the near-term impact of the outage on profitability.\nCapacity For Continued Investments\nI have already mentioned Crowdstrike's ability to drive impressive revenue growth and operational efficiency. But, in addition to this, the reason that I'm bullish on the company is mainly due to the fact that CrowdStrike's fundamental strengths are also backed by its commitment to reinvest back into the core business. Looking at the closest rival to CrowdStrike (Palo Alto Networks), CrowdStrike's Capex to CFO ratio is relatively higher. Although Palo Alto Networks has larger R&D capex spending in absolute terms, if CRWD sustains its impressive CFO growth, it will likely close the gap with PANW soon. CrowdStrike's top-line and CFO is growing much faster compared to rivals.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nStrong Balance Sheet\nCrowdStrike also maintains a solid balance sheet. As of Q2 FY25, the company held $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents against $743.2 million in long-term debt, giving it a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of 0.28. Furthermore, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.75 suggests that CrowdStrike can comfortably manage its debt using operating profits. Furthermore, while some competitors and investors overhyped the potential for CrowdStrike to lose business, the company's operating leverage remains on track. With its continued focus on platform consolidation, I expect CrowdStrike to maintain its leadership position and recover from the recent setbacks caused by the outage.\nValuation Thoughts\nFrom a valuation standpoint, I am quite optimistic about CrowdStrike's potential. I believe CrowdStrike is currently trading at a significant discount, especially when considering the several growth catalysts that will unfold in both the short and long term. At the moment, CrowdStrike is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23x, which is well below its five-year historical average of 29x. This disparity may suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its historical valuation, presenting a unique buying opportunity for investors. In the near term, I anticipate that CrowdStrike's stock may experience some additional drawdowns as investors reassess their positions in light of the recent outage. However, I view this as a temporary phase, which could provide a compelling entry point for those who may have missed out on the stock during its earlier growth stages.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\nCRWD Data by GuruFocus\nHistorically, CrowdStrike's P/S ratio has been considerably higher, so I expect that as the company fully recovers from the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) incident, its valuation will revert closer to the five-year average of 29x. Given these factors, I'm setting a target multiple of 27x, which would imply a price target of around $375 per share. This represents an upside of approximately 20%, which, in my opinion, provides a solid margin for investors to take advantage of at current levels.\nCrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges\n[Alpha Spread]\nFrom a discounted cash flow (DCF) perspective, I used a discount rate of 8% (which reflects the company's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC) and applied a conservative terminal growth rate of 5%. This DCF analysis aligns with Wall Street's growth forecasts for CrowdStrike over the next five years, which reflects a topline-growth rate of 15% over the next five years and some operating leverage improvements as the company expands beyond endpoint protection and solidifies its position as a leader in platform consolidation, offering a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity services. The scalability and robustness of the Falcon platform have already been proven, supporting the optimistic outlook from analysts. Based on this DCF model, I derive an upside of roughly 19% (with a target price of $408), which I believe offers ample margin for value investors seeking to capitalize on CrowdStrike's current valuation. Given the company's strong fundamentals, its recovery potential, and the broader market opportunity, I see this as an attractive entry point for those looking to invest at these levels.\nConclusion\nDespite the recent outage and its immediate challenges, I remain confident in CrowdStrike's long-term growth potential. The company's current market position, and the strategy towards platform consolidation positions it well to capitalize on the growing trend of enterprise customers seeking to streamline their cybersecurity solutions with a single provider to save costs and improve efficiency. Even after the setback (with regards to BSOD), CrowdStrike secured significant deals, demonstrating resilience and maintaining market trust. Additionally, with its current valuation appearing attractive compared to historical averages, a robust balance sheet, and a proven ability to drive growth through its Falcon platform, I see this as a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on its recovery and long-term market potential.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 6.7% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nStory Continues\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs CRWD a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.65.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.

In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies\u2019 director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI in and of itself will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

NHTC.\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nTop Analyst Reports for Broadcom, Merck and Qualcomm\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nBroadcom\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company\u2019s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.\nHowever, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom\u2019s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.\n(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\nMerck\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\nYet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\nShares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.\nStory Continues\nAggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.\nHowever, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space. The company formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions.\n(You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)\nShares of Natural Health Trends have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+1.8% vs. +21.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, a declining active member base remains the biggest concern for the company. It faces liquidity challenges and high operating expenses. Dependency on key markets and intense competition pose additional risks.\nHowever, expansion into new markets and improvement in cost management bode well.\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Health Trends here >>>)\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

          "whole_article": "Thursday, November 21, 2024\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC). These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nBroadcom\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors\u00a0industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company\u2019s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.\nHowever, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom\u2019s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\nMerck\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\nYet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\nShares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.\nAggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.\nHowever, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space. The company formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions.\nStory Continues\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)\nShares of Natural Health Trends have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+1.8% vs. +21.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, a declining active member base remains the biggest concern for the company. It faces liquidity challenges and high operating expenses. Dependency on key markets and intense competition pose additional risks.\nHowever, expansion into new markets and improvement in cost management bode well.\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Natural Health Trends here >>>)\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shopify Inc. (SHOP), Fiserv, Inc. (FI) and Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC).\n\nMark Vickery\nSenior Editor\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

High competition from other players is an overhang.\nMarsh & McLennan (MMC) Strategic Buyouts Aid, Expenses High\nPer the Zacks analyst, multiple acquisitions help Marsh & McLennan expand geographically, and diversify its portfolio. However, escalating expenses continue to trim margins.\nIncrease in New Insurance Written Aid MGIC Investment (MTG)\nPer the Zacks analyst, MGIC Investment is set to grow on higher insurance in force and annual persistency, lower claims and a strong capital position. Yet, rising expenses weigh on margin expansion.\nPre-Salt Reserves Help Petrobras (PBR), Debt Mountain Hurts\nThe Zacks analyst believes Petrobras' stakes in Brazil's lucrative pre-salt oil reservoirs should improve its earnings outlook, but is concerned about the company's massive $44,251 million debt load.\nCustomer Growth, Investment Aid Pinnacle West Capital (PNW)\nPer the Zacks analyst, Pinnacle West is gaining from customer additions, which is creating demand. Investment in infrastructure and energy generation is aiding it to serve customers efficiently.\nQuanta (PWR) Benefits From Strong Demand Amid Labor Woes\nPer the Zacks analyst, Quanta is benefiting from robust demand for its services and accretive acquisitions. However, labor and supply chain woes are major concerns.\nOngoing Menu Expansion Aids QIAGEN (QGEN), Macro Woes Stay\nPer the Zacks analyst, QIAGEN's robust R&D spending to expand the testing menu across key platforms is encouraging. Yet, macroeconomic volatilities, including the challenges in China, raise concerns.\nNew Upgrades\nCorcept (CORT) Rides on Robust Korlym Sales Performance\nPer the Zacks analyst, Corcept's sole drug, Korlym, approved for treating Cushing's syndrome, is driving the top-line. The company is also making good progress with its promising pipeline candidates.\nFocus on Cost Savings to Bolster McCormick's (MKC) Margins\nPer the Zacks analyst, McCormick's focus on cost-saving plans will continue to enhance its margins. The company expects its fiscal 2024 gross margin to increase by 50 to 100 basis points.\nProduct Rollouts & Growing Merchant Base Aid Shopify (SHOP)\nPer the Zacks analyst, Shopify is benefiting from expanding merchant base driven by applications like Shopify Bill Pay, Tax platform, Collective and Marketplace Connect solutions.\nNew Downgrades\nDecline in Vehicle Production, Rising Debt Ail Magna (MGA)\nPer the Zacks analyst, lower-than-anticipated vehicle production in North America and Europe is likely to hurt Magna's top-line growth. Rising debt levels are also concerning.\nHigh Costs, Falling Revenues Hurt Affiliated Managers (AMG)\nPer the Zacks analyst, weak top-line performance, and elevated costs are major near-term headwinds for Affiliated Managers. The presence of substantial intangible assets on its balance sheet is a woe.\nSpectrum Brands (SPB) Struggles With Numerous Headwinds\nPer the Zacks analyst, Spectrum Brands has been witnessing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty for a while. In addition, foreign currency translations are acting as deterrents.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

          "whole_article": "Investor confidence in certain major companies has propelled markets higher, but there are also those betting against big-name stocks through short selling amid continued uncertainty.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly topped the 6,000-point mark in the recent rally following Donald Trump's election win, though they have since eased back, with the main US index closing Wednesday's session flat at 5,917.\nWhile markets broadly rose following the US election, there were a particular group of stocks that rallied in what has been dubbed the \"Trump trade\", around expectations as to the policies that the Republican president-elect could look to implement after he returns to the White House in January.\nOne of which was Tesla (TSLA), as the electric carmaker's CEO Elon Musk was a major supporter of Trump's campaign and has since been nominated by the president-elect to co-lead the recently announced Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nRead more: FTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win\nThe post-election rally in Tesla stock pushed its market valuation to over the $1tn mark, which was welcome news for investors that are bullish about the company's prospects.\nHowever, not all investors were reaping the benefits, as data from S3 Partners showed that short-sellers had lost nearly $8bn by the Monday after the election, according to Business Insider.\nUnlike the traditional way of investing in markets by buying shares with the goal of selling them at a higher price, also known as going \"long\", short selling aims to make a profit on the declining price of the stock. An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.\nThe hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.\nAnd while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.\nAnalysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) in the last month.\nHere are the major companies that have become popular shorts.\nPopular short stocks\nS3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.\nStory continues\nChipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.\nThe demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.\nAt the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.\nShares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.\nAnd Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.\nRead more: Rise in UK borrowing shows Reeves has 'little wiggle room' on spending\nThe discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.\nTesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.\nHowever, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve \"slight growth\" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.\nS3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).\nFollowing its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.\nS&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this \"may be related to the [US] election\".\nThey said that despite this significant activity in \"all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses\".\nGlobal short bets\nMeanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.\nThe data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on \"crowdedness\", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors\u2019 supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.\nLVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.\nThe company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an \"uncertain economic and geopolitical environment\" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.\nRead more: FTSE 100 and European-listed stocks to own in 2025, according to Barclays\nThe luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\nKering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.\nShares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.\nMultinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.\nDiageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIt has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.\nIn South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.\nRead more: What we know about planned UK private stock market Pisces\nHindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were \"nothing but a lie\".\nOn Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.\nShares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.\nIn a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were \"baseless\".\nHindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.\nHowever, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Computer and Technology peers, we might be able to answer that question.\nBroadcom Inc. is a member of our Computer and Technology group, which includes 619 different companies and currently sits at #2 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Broadcom Inc. is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO's full-year earnings has moved 5% higher within the past quarter. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.\nAccording to our latest data, AVGO has moved about 46.3% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, the Computer and Technology sector has returned an average of 28.4% on a year-to-date basis.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024\nHow Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.\nOf course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\nStory Continues\nBroadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.\nOur View\nWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers\u2014critical components for Nvidia\u2019s AI-focused operations.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nA strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.\nHistorically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s during major market reactions. Nvidia\u2019s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.\nHow To Buy AVGO Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account.

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nChip stocks are down 3% since the election. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure.\nOnce the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months.\nNvidia (NVDA) earnings \u2014 coming after the bell Wednesday \u2014 will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday.\n\"It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,\" said Essaye. \"It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.\"\nNvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock \u2014 up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years \u2014 hit record highs following the election.\nBut many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.\nSemiconductor returns during the second half of 2024\nThe worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.\nMeanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) \u2014 seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor \u2014 is down 14%.\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTo be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday.\n\"Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],\" said Essaye.\nSince the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia \u2014 \"priced to perfection\" according to many analysts \u2014 underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.\nStory Continues\nBut Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this \"bellwether\" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.\n\"They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far,\" he said. \"I think they can do it again.\"\nmorning brief image\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.\nWhen it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there\u2019s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University\u2019s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).\nFounded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university\u2019s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard\u2019s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard\u2019s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university\u2019s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard\u2019s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.\nAccording to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. \u201cNarv\u201d Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia\u2019s 11.5% or Brown\u2019s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC\u2019s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:\n\u201cIn FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC\u2019s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.\u201d\nNotably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from \"overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500.\" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar\u2019s strategy of overhauling the university\u2019s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Harvard Management Company\u2019s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nHarvard Management Company's Stake: $89.6 million\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the world\u2019s largest technology companies, with operations spanning the hardware and software sectors. The company\u2019s primary strength is in hardware, as it supplies networking and custom chips across diverse applications.\nIn its third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and robust non-AI semiconductor sales. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI revenue to grow 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the annual AI revenue to $12 billion, largely fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOn November 6, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company\u2019s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing \u201cseasonal headwinds\u201d linked to a product transition for Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's \"easy\" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some \"serious gains.\"\n\"I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It\u2019s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don\u2019t count. But that, people, is nonsense.\"\nCramer said banks do not \"care\" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.\n\"I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I\u2019m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.\"\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks.\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 130\nCommenting about Broadcom in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said:\n\u201cI am also pulling for Broadcom. I think Broadcom should do well. I don\u2019t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.\u201d\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market.\u00a0Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\nThe company\u2019s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe continued to build our position in\u00a0Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers \u2013 such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few \u2013 will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nCan we expect growth from ServiceNow?\nNYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.\nOn November 18, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) announced that it has expanded its strategic alliance with Microsoft. Building on their existing partnership, Service Now\u2019s Now Assist and Microsoft 365 Copilot integration will now enable streamlined workflows and enable self-service capabilities within Microsoft applications. In essence, the strategic alliance will help modernize front-office business processes. Copilot will simplify tasks through intelligent automation, while ServiceNow AI agents will manage workflows and offer solutions to complex problems.\n\u201cA strong partnership between ServiceNow and Microsoft means customers gain the best of both worlds: seamless, secure, and smart workflows. By combining our strengths, we're enabling organizations to harness AI and automation in ways that fundamentally change how they work\u2014reducing complexity, driving productivity, and helping teams move faster. This partnership isn\u2019t just about technology; it's about setting customers up for long-term success in a digital world.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:\n14% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\nTo start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.\nNYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\nStory Continues\nIs ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:NOW)\nCramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:\n\u201cLet's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive\u2026 Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market\u2026 Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting\u2026 Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again\u2026 Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company\u2019s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.\nOverall NOW ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing \u201csovereign\u201d artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to \u201ccodify\u201d a country\u2019s culture, history, and collective intelligence.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News You Must Read Today.\nThat said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.\u201d\nWhile AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.\nLatest Advancements in AI\nIn recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification\u201d.\nStory Continues\nOther fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.\nIn other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed \u201cOperator\u201d, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human\u2019s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia\u2019s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.\nThis partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.\nFor the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%.

Quote\nWith the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.\nJPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.\nThe Technical Take\nThe stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO\u2019d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.\nAfter trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.\nWith the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.\nPost earnings low: $36\nGap fill: $33\n21-day: $32\n50-day: $29.20\n200-day: $25.20\nFibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32\nWhile that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.\nIn Summary\nToast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.\nThe company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.\nAs Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.\nBear of the Day:\nClean Harbors \u00a0is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.\nThe company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?\nWith an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.\nAbout the Company\nClean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).\nThe company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world\u2019s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.\nCLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cD\u201d in Value, But \u201cB\u201d in both Momentum and Growth.\nQ3 Earnings\nThe company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.\nDespite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.\nPositive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.\nWhile there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.\nEarnings Estimates\nEstimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.\nFor the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.\nLooking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.\nFor the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year\u2019s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.\nTechnical Take\nThe drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.\nThis volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.\nThe drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.\nThe stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.\nIn Summary\nClean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.\nWith significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.\nAdditional content:\nServiceNow Expands Generative AI Offerings: Is the Stock a Buy?\nServiceNow\u00a0is adding Generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to the Now platform to foster responsible AI. NOW is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio, including new, expanded Now Assist capabilities with an AI Governance feature for secure and compliant AI practices.\nNOW\u2019s expanding GenAI portfolio and rich partner base have been driving top-line growth.

The free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, subscription revenues are projected between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 21.5-22% on a GAAP basis. At cc, subscription revenues are expected to grow at 20.5%.\nCurrent Remaining Performance Obligation is expected to grow 21.5% year over year on both non-GAAP and GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% for the current quarter.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $13.87 per share, up 0.4% over the past 30 days, indicating a 28.66% year-over-year increase.\nServiceNow, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ServiceNow, Inc. Quote\nThe consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.\nStrong Portfolio Aids NOW\u2019s Prospects\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.\nServiceNow\u2019s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.\nThe Xanadu update adds the latest AI capabilities to boost customer agility, enhance productivity and improve employee experiences.

It is expected to reduce the time to resolve an issue and make live agents more productive.\nStrong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive\nA strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nNOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.\nThe strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.\nIn third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.\nNOW\u2019s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation\nHowever, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector\u2019s 6.37X.\nWe believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow\u2019s premium valuation.\nConclusion\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.\nServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NOW\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ServiceNow here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nStory Continues\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in NOW?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.\nInsiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nNYSE:NOW Insider Trading Volume November 14th 2024\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nInsider Ownership Of ServiceNow\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nStory Continues\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?\nInsiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a015 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\nRecent AI Developments\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\nStory Continues\nIn its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn\u2019t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot\u2019s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.\nIn other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.\n\u201cAd programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps digitize and unify organizations so that they can find smarter, faster, better ways to make work flow.\nOn November 12, Wells Fargo raised the firm\u2019s price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $1,150 from $1,050 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares. According to the firm, ServiceNow is among the few companies that are demonstrating tangible AI monetization, i.e. they are really making money from AI. One of the key catalysts that will drive this momentum forward is the launch of its CSM/ITSM agents in Xanadu on November 24. The launch is a major step for the company in enhancing its AI-led customer service offerings. Finally, Wells Fargo expects ServiceNow to take the lead in AI customer service.\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them.
