          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMeta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nRead Also:\u00a010 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street.\nData centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "More than 6 million UK consumers have fallen prey to online fraudsters in the past year, with social media platforms and online marketplaces emerging as the most frequent avenues for scams, according to consumer watchdog Which?.\nFigures reveal that approximately 6.6 million British shoppers have lost money to scams over the last 12 months, with nearly 5 million of those affected being targeted on popular platforms such as Facebook (META), Instagram, YouTube (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and WhatsApp.\nThese platforms, alongside others like TikTok, Google, and X (formerly Twitter), have been rife with scams that continue to affect millions of users.\nRead more: UK consumer confidence rises after budget and US election\nThe report comes as the UK government\u2019s voluntary Online Fraud Charter marks its first anniversary. The charter, signed by major tech companies, aimed to combat online fraud by introducing a series of protective measures, including the verification of new advertisers and the swift removal of fraudulent content. However, despite these commitments, the scale of the problem remains substantial, raising questions about the effectiveness of the current response.\nAccording to Which?\u2019s findings, the vast majority (63%) of scams occurred on social media platforms, with 42% of victims reporting fraud via search engines, 39% on online marketplaces, and 23% through messaging services. The most common platforms for scams were Facebook (37%), Google (33%), Instagram (20%), Amazon (18%), and WhatsApp (18%).\nWhich? surveyed over 2,000 UK adults to determine whether the charter has had an impact on the number of scams consumers encounter on online platforms and whether they feel safer online in the year since the initiative began.\nNearly 73% of UK adults expressed distrust in the ads they encounter on social media and search engines, while a third (34%) reported feeling less confident in using online platforms compared to a year ago. Only 3% said they felt more secure.\nRead more: Best savings accounts that offer above-inflation rates\nThe continuing prevalence of scams has left consumers increasingly anxious, with 22% of respondents encountering suspicious ads or messages every day over the last six months.\nRocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: \u201cFor every week the government fails to take action, we lose millions to fraudsters and organised crime groups \u2013 taking money from productive firms, reducing overall levels of investment in the UK economy and damaging consumer confidence. The government and regulators need to act urgently to tackle the fraud epidemic or risk millions more falling victim to scammers.\u201d\nStory continues\nThe Online Safety Act, which is set to hold online platforms accountable for fraudulent advertising, will not be fully enforced until 2027. Concha argued that this timeline is far too slow, urging regulator Ofcom to implement regulations sooner and for a more coordinated approach across the tech, banking and telecom sectors to address the rising tide of scams.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the \"Magnificent Seven.\" And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the\u00a0stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it\u2019s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\nThere\u2019s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains \u2014 a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period \u2014 weren\u2019t what they used to be.\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\u201cWe are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,\u201d Creative Strategies director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they\u2019re spending on AI hardware.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega-rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, on Nov. 19. (Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nNvidia\u2019s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer\u2019s Jacob Bourne.\nStory Continues\n\u201cCritical questions around Blackwell\u2019s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,\u201d Bourne said in a note. \u201cThere\u2019s little room for execution missteps in 2025.\u201d\nThere is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump\u2019s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.\nFor the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.\nThat said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.\nOf course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.\nCheck out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance\nThe bigger question is whether AI will transform computing over the long term or whether it\u2019s just another investing trend.

In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters.

In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPrivate equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models.

I say that as a compliment. Nobody gets away with charging too much anymore\u2014not in this country, no matter the industry, perhaps even the drug industry. It\u2019s happening now, it\u2019s happening fast, and many companies are being left behind by the change. I see it everywhere I go\u2014in the grocery store, online, in the mall, and, of course, in the stock market.\u201d\nCramer talked about how restaurants that offer cheaper but quality meals are seeing a surge in their stock prices amid rising revenues. He also discussed how weight-loss drugs are impacting companies that sell alcohol products.\n\u201cAmerican people are tired of paying up. They feel gou, they feel betrayed, they feel that the only thing about brand loyalty is that it isn\u2019t worth a dime. They want a better deal.

Cramer said he agrees with the analyst.\nStory Continues\nMichael Nathanson said the following about Meta Platforms\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0in a latest interview with CNBC:\n\u201cMeta, their core business is really getting the benefit of AI. You see it in their ad numbers; they\u2019re accelerating. Their engagement is doing really, really well, so they definitely have momentum behind their business. And they\u2019ve beat our numbers all year long.\u201d\nDespite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\nAccording to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta\u2019s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), the world\u2019s largest social network, were up this quarter, due to impressive top-line growth of 22% year-over-year and solid forward guidance. Despite its large scale, Meta continues to outgrow the broader digital advertising industry, with better AI-driven content recommendations increasing engagement in products like Instagram Reels, and AI improving ad targeting and conversion rates. Our industry checks have continued to validate advertiser adoption and satisfaction, with improvements in Reels monetization, as well as strong adoption of Advantage+, Meta\u2019s AI-driven service to allocate advertiser budgets across its content surfaces.\nOverall, META ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's latest stock picks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has been unloading shares of one of its biggest holdings, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), across several quarters.\nThe first quarter of 2024 saw Warren Buffett selling 115 million Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, about 13% of its stake. Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake stood at 790 million shares at the end of the first quarter. Based on Apple\u2019s March 31 closing price, the company sold approximately $20 billion worth of Apple shares, likely spread across multiple transactions. Apple Inc.\u2019s shares fell nearly 11% during the same period.\nOn top of the 115 million shares sold during Q1 2024, Buffett went on to unload another 390 million shares in the second quarter. The sales led to a boost in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s cash reserves to a record $277 billion, up 47% from the first quarter. Despite Apple\u2019s slowing sales and a weak macroeconomic environment in China, the iPhone maker\u2019s stock was up.\nIn the third quarter, Buffett\u2019s company sold 100 million more Apple shares, leaving Berkshire with about $70 billion worth of stock. This reduced its stake in the iPhone maker to 300 million shares. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s shares rose more than 10% in the third quarter.\nAccording to Warren Buffett, selling Apple stocks made sense as Buffett believes stocks are trading above their intrinsic value and capital gains taxes are also likely to rise. This makes it advantageous to realize gains at the current lower tax rate as Buffett is trying to lock in profits before potential tax hikes. Another reason for selling the shares is to reduce exposure since the stock had become a very large portion of its portfolio.\nDespite Berkshire reducing its stake, Apple\u2019s stock price increased from $192.53 at the end of 2023 to $233 by the end of the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a 15.8% YTD gain. This suggests strong market demand for Apple shares and investor confidence in the company. Moreover, the selling strategy employed by Berkshire not only allowed it to book substantial gains but also preserved the stock\u2019s upward momentum. All in all, the company has effectively realized over $100 billion in profits from a seven-year investment, and there is confidence that Berkshire will reinvest the funds effectively over time.\nHere is how Vltava Fund explained why Buffett was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cYou probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire\u2019s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett\u2019s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire\u2019s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\u201d\nStory Continues\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

However, there remain many uncertainties at this stage, the firm said.\nStory Continues\nAnalyst Edison Lee, who holds a \u201cHold\u201d rating on Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), noted that the company was exempt from import tariffs during Trump\u2019s first term from 2016 to 2020. Since then, Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0has taken steps to diversify its production outside of China, such as shifting some manufacturing to India. Despite these efforts, only about 10% of iPhones are produced outside of China. While it\u2019s possible that Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0could secure another exemption, Lee suggested that if it doesn\u2019t, the impact on gross margins could be significant.\n\u201c[Our] analysis indicates AAPL\u2019s [gross margins] could potentially be impacted by 3.0-6.7ppt, and our DCF value by ~5% to 10%, assuming no ASP/vol change,\u201d Lee wrote in a note to clients.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\nThe largest relative detractors during the quarter were\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), Airbnb, and Tesla (not owned). We added a new position in Apple during the period, which we discuss further in the following section. While Apple is a roughly average-sized position in Focus Growth, it is the largest holding in the Russell 1000 Growth Index, at over 12%, and the stock\u2019s outperformance in the quarter weighed on relative results.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook joined more than 20 corporate leaders in discussions with China\u2019s premier Monday, as global companies grapple with potential trade disruptions and economic uncertainty.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City\u2019s \u2018Living Breakwaters\u2019 Brace for Stormier Seas\nIn Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women\u2019s Sports Takes the Field\nNYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future\nNYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge\nCook, who\u2019s visiting the country for at least the third time this year, joined top executives of global firms including Rio Tinto Plc, Corning Inc. and Charoen Pokphand Group in a meeting with Li Qiang, state media reported. Chinese corporate chiefs including the heads of Lenovo Group and ICBC also attended the event, which discussed supply chain and trade issues.\nThe meeting, in which about two dozen executives took part, marked the first high-level meeting between foreign corporations and a senior Beijing official since Donald Trump won a second four-year term. Companies worldwide are bracing for the president-elect\u2019s threat to hike tariffs on Chinese goods.\nThe gathering of business leaders, which took place before a supply chain expo in Beijing starting Tuesday, was earlier reported by Bloomberg News.\nIt went on for over an hour and felt pretty scripted, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing a private event. Li, at one point, quoted Adam Smith\u2019s view that the propensity to truck, barter and exchange was inherent in human nature, the people said.\nLi also told the executives to send any feedback to him, saying he would take it seriously, one of the people said. The premier didn\u2019t mention Trump or tariffs, another person said.\nIn a separate report by the official Xinhua News Agency, Li said Beijing is against decoupling and urged efforts to maintain the stability of the global supply chain. He also vowed to continue developing the Chinese economy.\nDisruptions to trade are a source of concern especially for Apple, which makes the majority of its iPhones through Foxconn in the country and counts China as its biggest market after the US.\nThe Apple CEO was in the capital just last month, when he promised to keep investing in the country and also underscored its vital role in the iPhone maker\u2019s global operations.\nCook on Monday made it a point to emphasize the importance of the Chinese supply chain during brief remarks carried by a social media account linked to state broadcaster China Central Television. \u201cI value them very highly. We could not do what we do without them,\u201d Cook said in response to a question about Apple\u2019s Chinese partners.\nStory Continues\nBeijing this year has taken a more active role in encouraging foreign investment, as the economy remains mired in a post-Covid funk.\nAmCham China \u2014 represented by President Michael Hart at the meeting with Li \u2014 said the discussions focused on opportunities to strengthen supply chain resilience and expand bilateral and multilateral engagement. This is the first time that AmCham China has met with a Chinese premier since May 2022.\nLi last held a roundtable with foreign business executives ahead of the China International Import Expo in Shanghai earlier this month. Since Trump\u2019s election victory, he has picked several China hawks for top posts in his new administration.\nAlso present at the meeting were Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont, Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. Chairman Matsumoto Masayoshi, Robin Zeng of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., and Li Dongsheng, the chairman of TCL Technology Group Corp.\nOver the weekend, Nvidia Corp. honcho Jensen Huang was in Hong Kong receiving an honorary doctorate.\n--With assistance from Colum Murphy, Phila Siu, Catherine Wong and Alan Wong.\n(Updates with details throughout)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\nClear\u2019s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End\nAn Airline\u2019s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.\nThe Most Powerful Brand in the US\nbrandon-romanchuk-NOFyRmSQfUQ-unsplash\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNo. of Hedge Funds: 158\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a globally renowned technology giant, known for its iconic products such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch. The company\u2019s ecosystem, including services like iCloud and Apple Music, has built a loyal customer base.\nOn October 31, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results ended September 28. The company reported a record-breaking quarter revenue, with revenue increasing 6% year over year to $94.9 billion. According to CEO Tim Cook, the strong revenue growth was driven by the success of the company\u2019s latest product lineup, including the iPhone 16 series, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Cook also highlighted the company\u2019s commitment to innovation, citing the recent release of Apple Intelligence features that prioritize user privacy and enhance the overall user experience.\nOn October 30, Apple introduced two new chips, the M4 Pro and M4 Max, which join the M4 to form the most advanced family of chips ever built for a personal computer. The M4 family of chips is designed to bring far more power-efficient performance and advanced capabilities to the Mac. All three chips are built using industry-leading, second-generation 3-nanometer technology, which improves performance and power efficiency.\nIn their third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\nOverall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\u201cWe disagree with the findings in the report\u00a0regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS.\n\u201cWe are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report\u00a0for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act\u00a0would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart.\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d"

And while local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei Technologies spin-off Honor have already introduced artificial intelligence software to their handsets, Apple is still awaiting approval from Chinese regulators to launch its AI services.\nHuawei is slated to debut on Tuesday its Mate 70 smartphone series, the successor to the Mate 60 series that surprised many with its 5G capability and advanced processor when it was launched last year. The official Huawei online store showed that over 3 million people had signed up for pre-orders of various Mate 70 models on Monday. Pre-orders only signal an intention to buy, without requiring a deposit.\nDespite the worldwide popularity of its iPhone 16 Pro launched in September, Apple saw a sharp double-digit year-on-year decrease in smartphone sales in China during this year's Singles' Day, according to research firm Counterpoint. In contrast, sales of Huawei's handsets grew 7 per cent during the world's biggest online shopping event.\nStory Continues\nApple's revenue in the 12 months ended September 28 fell 7.7 per cent year on year in the Greater China market, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, according to its latest financial report.\nAmid the growing challenges, Cook in March went on a charm offensive in Shanghai, where he met local video game developers, a filmmaker and Wang Chuanfu, the billionaire founder of electric vehicle maker BYD. He also opened a new Apple store.\nIn October, Cook travelled to Beijing to meet top Chinese officials, including the head of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the minister of commerce.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nDan Niles Says Amazon.com (AMZN)\u2019s Latest Earnings Was \u2018Real Surprise\u2019 For Him\nTtatty / Shutterstock.com\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\nTalking about Big Tech earnings in a latest program on CNBC, Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0earnings brought a \u201csurprise\u201d for him.\nStory Continues\n\u201cAmazon was the real surprise to me, where eCommerce guidance was actually pretty strong even though you have one less weekend this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas for people to go shopping. That didn\u2019t seem to matter. Business is really good for them.\u201d\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0threw it out of the park with its latest quarterly results amid strong Cloud growth. Amazon Web Services has generated $27.5 billion in revenue, marking a 19% year-over-year increase. The segment\u2019s operating income is expanding at nearly 2.5 times the rate of its revenue growth, boosting Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s overall operating income. At this pace, AWS is on track to deliver $110 billion in annualized revenue. If it maintains its ~20% growth rate, AWS could reach $125-130 billion in revenue in FY 2025.\nFor the ongoing quarter, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) expects revenue between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, implying growth of up to 11%. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 32.9, higher than the big tech average of 25.5. If Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0grows its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 25% annually over the next three years, it could achieve an EPS of around $9.25 by FY 2027 (up from an estimated $4.74 in FY 2024). Applying a 35x P/E ratio in line with Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) historical average suggests a fair stock value of over $300. The primary catalyst for this target would be AWS\u2019s robust operating income growth.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest absolute detractors were Alphabet, Airbnb, and\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon\u2019s position as a notable detractor speaks more to the size of the position than the magnitude of the underperformance, as the company delivered a solid set of results during the quarter.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 23%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant player in the eCommerce and cloud computing industries. As a result, its narrative is driven by consumer and enterprise spending. Consumer spending is important for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) since it enables the firm to generate adequate merchandise volume shipments to maintain margins. Similarly, high enterprise spending means that the company is able to generate revenue through its cloud computing business. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s sizable moats in these two key industries have enabled it to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from its $71 billion in cash and equivalents. In turn, the sizable resources have allowed Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to expand its presence in the AI industry through its partnership with Anthropic. The firm is also one of the leading players in custom chip development for data center workloads, and it is developing custom chips to help reduce reliance on NVIDIA's expensive GPUs. To sum it up, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s tailwinds depend on robust consumer spending, cost efficiencies in the retail business, and enterprise spending on AI and cloud products.\nPolen Capital mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cThe largest absolute detractors were Alphabet, Airbnb, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon\u2019s position as a notable detractor speaks more to the size of the position than the magnitude of the underperformance, as the company delivered a solid set of results during the quarter.\nOverall AMZN ranks 8th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nRead Also:\u00a010 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

AWS also announced plans to invest $10.12 billion over five years in the United Kingdom.\nDuring the third quarter, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) introduced several advancements in its AI and infrastructure capabilities, powered by the Graviton4 processor, which offers 75% more memory bandwidth and 30% better compute performance compared to its predecessor. AWS also announced a collaboration with Databricks to enhance custom AI model development using Databricks Mosaic AI for improved generative AI application performance and cost efficiency.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

These could be wise investments as it often pays to opt for reliable and well-known brands whose products may last longer than cheaper knock-offs, but not everyone can afford to buy them at their regular price.\nThe shopping event, which starts on 29 November, has become a spectacle in recent years, with most major retailers claiming to offer big discounts on a sometimes bewildering array of products.\nRead more: More than 6 million UK consumers scammed online in past year\nShoppers may be tempted to hold off on buying a product earlier in the year, so they can get a better deal on Black Friday. However, concerns are rife about scams, fraud and \"bargains\" that are anything but.\nOn the other hand, as financial expert Martin Lewis notes, price-tracking tools, such as Amazon (AMZN)'s Camel Camel Camel, can help take the guess work out of shopping on Black Friday to help you find genuinely great deals on items that you already had your eye on.\nWhat do you think?

However, Coupang's operations go well beyond e-commerce; it has cultivated a full ecosystem of services that provide convenience and added value to its customers. In this article, we'll explore the company's model, recent growth strategies, and why it holds strong potential as an investment.\nBuilding a Comprehensive Ecosystem\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with CPNG.\nCoupang's business model revolves around its proprietary \"Rocket Delivery\" system, offering same-day and next-day delivery for orders received by midnight, with packages often delivered by 7 a.m. the following morning. This fast delivery is possible due to Coupang's extensive logistics network, which includes over 100 fulfillment centers across South Korea. The strategic placement of these centers allows Coupang to reach 70% of the South Korean population within a 7-mile radius. While the company has made significant investments in infrastructure, these investments create long-term competitive advantages. High entry barriers mean that any new entrant would face significant costs to replicate Coupang's logistics scale, and they would still have to win over Coupang's loyal customer base.\nCoupang holds the highest market share in South Korea's e-commerce sector, effectively competing against both local and international players. Its commitment to rapid delivery, competitive pricing, and a diverse product selection has solidified its reputation as a leading online retailer.\nCoupang: The Amazon of South Korea Expands Its Reach\nSource: Author based on Statista\nBeyond e-commerce, Coupang's ecosystem includes a variety of offerings:\nRocket Fresh: A grocery delivery service that delivers by 7 a.m. if orders are placed before midnight.\nCoupang Eats: A restaurant delivery service similar to Uber Eats.\nCoupang Play: A subscription-based video streaming platform.\nCoupang Pay: Coupang's fintech arm, providing digital payment solutions.\nRocket Wow: Similar to Amazon Prime, this paid subscription service includes perks like free and expedited delivery options, exclusive discounts, and access to Coupang Play content.\nAnother key feature, Rocket Direct Purchasing (also called \"Rocket Jikgu\"), enables South Korean customers to purchase international products directly from countries like the United States, China, and Japan, with Coupang handling all logistics, customs, and delivery. Additionally, Coupang Flex provides flexible, part-time delivery opportunities known as Flexers, similar to DoorDash's (NASDAQ:DASH) drivers Dashers.\nStory Continues\nWOW Membership\nWOW members increasingly recognize the value of their membership, which includes benefits such as free same-day and dawn delivery, free returns, exclusive content on Coupang Play, and discounted deliveries from Coupang Eats. This strategy has proven effective in increasing user engagement. For example, Coupang recently introduced a 5% to 10% discount on Eats orders for WOW members, resulting in a 90% increase in Eats orders by WOW members and more than doubling Eats' transaction volumes in many regions.\nWOW members who use Eats also exhibit higher retention and engage more frequently across Coupang's ecosystem. This engagement translates into higher spending and cross-category purchasing, demonstrating the strength of Coupang's subscription-driven loyalty model.\nCoupang's Entry into Luxury Fashion\nIn January 2024, Coupang acquired Farfetch Holdings plc, a leading global online luxury fashion platform, for $500 million. Farfetch, previously battling high debt and consistent losses, had established itself as a significant player in luxury fashion but struggled with profitability and logistical challenges in a highly competitive space.\nCoupang views the acquisition as an opportunity to tap into the rapidly growing global personal luxury goods market, valued at around $400 billion. With this acquisition, Coupang can leverage its advanced logistics infrastructure to make high-end fashion more accessible and improve delivery standards for luxury goods, particularly in South Korea, where consumers are among the world's highest per capita spenders on luxury items. This acquisition provides Coupang with a unique positioning, combining speed and premium service for luxury shopping.\nLooking forward, Coupang plans to stabilize Farfetch's operations through the end of the year and explore potential synergies between the two companies in 2025. This integration could unlock new revenue streams and operational efficiencies, further strengthening Coupang's long-term growth prospects.\nExpansion into Taiwan\nBeyond South Korea, Coupang has been selectively expanding internationally. In June 2021, Coupang began operations in Japan, aiming to replicate its South Korean success. However, the company faced stiff competition from established players like Amazon and Rakuten and ultimately ceased operations in March 2023.\nAround the same time, Coupang also launched in Taiwan, where its signature \"Rocket Delivery\" service quickly gained popularity. By November 2023, Coupang had opened a second fulfillment center in Taoyuan City. Taiwan has been a success story, with Coupang's app becoming one of the most downloaded shopping apps in the region. Coupang's experience and learnings from South Korea have allowed Rocket Delivery to scale even faster in Taiwan. Management is leveraging advanced technology and processes developed over the years that enable Coupang to reach profitability in Taiwan faster than in Korea.\nFinancials\nIn the most recent quarter, Coupang's revenue grew 32% year-over-year (YoY) in currency-neutral terms, or 25% excluding Farfetch. This marks the 14th quarter out of the past 15 that Coupang has achieved at least 20% constant currency growth. Gross margin expanded by 350 basis points margin expansion in gross margin though a rise in general and administrative expenses from investments in automation, technology, and infrastructure kept the operating margin flat YoY. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $343 million, a 44% increase YoY, or $345 million excluding Farfetch.\nProduct commerce revenue increased by 20% YoY, reaching $6.9 billion, with an adjusted margin of 6.8%, up 10 bps from the previous year. Coupang's active customer base reached 22.5 million, driven by deeper engagement within existing customer segments and the expansion into new categories like Fresh and Fulfillment and Logistics by Coupang (FLC). Long-term growth is expected to be supported not only by these newer offerings but also by increasing spending from both existing and new customer cohorts, all of which saw notable spending growth this quarter.\nDeveloping offerings increase 347% YoY to $975 million. This segment includes services such as its signature \"Rocket Delivery\" to new customers in Taiwan, Coupang Eats, Coupang Play, Fintech Services and Farfetch Integration. Despite the strong revenue growth, Developing Offerings maintained negative margins, with an adjusted margin of -13% (representing a $127 million loss). While still in its growth phase, this segment is crucial to Coupang's diversification strategy and future growth.\nFarfetch alone contributed $439 million in revenue this quarter. Initially, Coupang aimed for near break-even profitability for Farfetch by the end of the year, but CFO Gaurav Anand recently noted that Farfetch is nearing break-even earlier than expected. For now, Coupang is focused on stabilizing Farfetch, with plans to assess and pursue synergies between Coupang and Farfetch in 2025.\nAlthough cash flows dipped slightly, this was not primarily due to Farfetch. Operating cash flow declined 54% YoY to $334 million, while free cash flow came in at -$42 million. Coupang attributed this drop mainly to one-time working capital benefits from the previous year. Over the past four quarters, Coupang has generated over $800 million in free cash flow, more than half of what it generated in the prior period. The company maintains a healthy balance sheet with over $5.8 billion in cash and $1.6 billion in debt.\nRisks\nWhile Coupang's growth story is impressive, several risks could impact its trajectory. In June 2024, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission fined Coupang 140 billion won (approximately $102 million) for allegedly manipulating search algorithms to favor its private-label products. This regulatory scrutiny could lead to increased compliance costs and require operational adjustments to align with fair trade practices.\nThe integration of Farfetch and international expansion add complexities around operational alignment and synergies. Coupang's experience in Japan, where it ceased operations due to strong competition, highlights the difficulties in expanding internationally. While I like how management acknowledged the error and ceased operations and despite Taiwan's expansion appears more promising, the challenges of replicating its South Korean model in different markets require ongoing adaptation and monitoring.\nValuation\nCoupang: The Amazon of South Korea Expands Its Reach\nSource: Author\nAs Coupang works toward consistent profitability, traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) metrics are not yet applicable. However, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, currently at 1.61x, is lower than that of peer companies like Amazon and Alibaba. This discount reflects Coupang's smaller size and earlier stage of maturity compared to its peers. Nonetheless, for growth-focused investors, Coupang's projected revenue growth rate of over 20% for the next two years is an attractive proposition.\nCoupang: The Amazon of South Korea Expands Its Reach\nLastly, using a discounted cash flow analysis, combining a multiples-based approach and a perpetuity growth model, I estimate Coupang's intrinsic value to be around $35 per share, suggesting a potential 40% upside from current levels.\nCoupang: The Amazon of South Korea Expands Its Reach\nSource: Author\nMy Final Take\nCoupang's rise in the e-commerce sector reflects its innovative logistics, customer-centric strategy, and expansion efforts beyond its core market. The Farfetch acquisition shows the optionality of Coupang and exemplifies the company's ambition to diversify its revenue streams, while the expansion in Taiwan highlights Coupang's adaptability and learning curve after the challenges faced in Japan. Given its growth potential, valuation, and strong positioning in South Korea and Taiwan, I believe Coupang has the potential to be a market-beater in the coming years.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Technology startups associated with AI have reached valuations in the tens of billions. Underpinning this situation is the rise in small businesses. According to the US Department of Treasury, an average of 430,000 new business applications were submitted monthly in 2024 \u2014 a 50% increase from 2019. However, the number of accountants needed to balance the books at these startups is diminishing.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 25, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia\u2019s NVDA and Amazon AMZN.\nTaking Stock of the Earnings Picture\nNvidia\u2019s quarterly results were excellent, with the chip giant not only beating estimates and raising guidance but also achieving top- and bottom-line growth rates that are typically associated with start-up players.\nNvidia\u2019s Q3 earnings increased +106.3% from the year-earlier period to $19.37 billion while revenues were up +93.6% year-over-year to +35.08 billion.\nTo get a sense of the market\u2019s lukewarm reaction to these otherwise impressive results from Nvidia, take a look at the chart below that plots the stock price relative to how estimates consensus EPS estimates have evolved over time.\nThe chart's light blue and red lines represent the evolution of consensus EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025, respectively. The steepness of those lines shows how persistent the favorable revisions trend has been, with analysts seemingly struggling to catch up with how strong underlying business trends have been for Nvidia.\nNvidia\u2019s stock market momentum has made its market capitalization the highest of the Magnificent 7 group at $3.59 trillion, surpassing Apple at $3.45 trillion and Microsoft at $3.07 trillion. Investors\u2019 lukewarm reaction suggests that they have become used to getting far bigger guidance upgrades than what they received this time around. Nvidia\u2019s upgraded guidance is solid, but relatively underwhelming by the company\u2019s own standards.\nWe don\u2019t want to come across as making too big of a deal of the stock\u2019s reaction to the quarterly results. After all, Nvidia shares are up +191.3% over the past year and have handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (up +32.5%), the S&P 500 index (up +30.4%), and the Mag 7 group (up +20.6%).\nBeyond Nvidia, the focus lately has been on the Retail sector, with several major conventional operators coming out with quarterly results. Through Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 29 of the 34 Retail sector companies in the S&P 500 index.\nRegular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players.\nStory Continues\nTotal Q3 earnings for these 29 retailers that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 58.6% beating EPS estimates and only 51.7% beating revenue estimates.\nMembers of the Zacks Retail sector have struggled to beat estimates in Q3, with the trend particularly notable on the EPS beats front that are tracking below the 20-quarter low at this stage.\nConcerning the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 24 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q3 earnings were up +71.6% on +11% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is now a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\nThrough Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 476 S&P 500 members, or 92.2% of the index\u2019s total membership. We have another 8 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this holiday-shortened week, including Dell, HP, Best Buy, and others.\nTotal earnings for these 476 companies that have reported are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 73.7% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates.\nThe proportion of these 476 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51.1%.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\nOne significant drag on the aggregate growth pace has been the Energy sector, whose Q3 earnings were down -22.9% from the same period last year on -2.7% lower revenues. Q3 earnings for the index would be up +10.6% on +6.3% higher revenues had it not been for this Energy sector drag. The growth trend appears stable-to-positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter averages.\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues.\nThe Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.\nHad it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +10.6% instead of +8.1%. Excluding the Tech sector\u2019s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be up only +2.9% instead of +8.1%.\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +2.4% instead of +8.1%.\nFor the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues.\nUnlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better.\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +7.9% earnings growth improves to +9.9% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Walmart and Target: A Closer Look at Retail Earnings\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Netflix stock (NFLX) closed at a fresh record every day this past week, with shares securing their biggest weekly gain since January \u2014 and they could keep soaring.\nA growing number of analysts are calling for the streaming giant's shares to soon trade in the quadruple digits.\nOn Wednesday, Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak raised his price target on Netflix to a Street high of $1,100 a share, implying over 20% upside based on current trading levels of around $900.\nBank of America's Jessica Reif Ehrlich followed one day later, boosting her target to $1,000 from $800. Jefferies analyst James Heaney also raised his target to $1,000 earlier this week.\nThe price target increases come despite some concerns over slowing growth for the streaming giant.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nWall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $800 a share, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.\nOne of the main catalysts for the recent price target boosts is the company's continued foray into live events, with the most recent boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson attracting over 108 million global viewers last weekend to become the most-streamed sporting event of all time.\nFor context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers.\nThe Netflix event's impressive numbers came despite the streamer experiencing several technical glitches throughout the broadcast, which analysts (and investors) mostly shrugged off.\n\"We view the event as a (very) successful learning experience for NFLX and expect these technical issues will not happen again with future live events,\" Pivotal Research's Wlodarczak wrote on Wednesday.\nThe analyst said the event's success likely means Netflix will \"accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming,\" which will help lower subscriber churn and increase the streamer's ability to raise prices.\n\"The NFLX service remains a highly compelling, frankly relatively inexpensive, entertainment alternative for consumers, which bodes well for future subscriber/average revenue per user growth,\" he said.\nNetflix's 'complementary growth drivers'\nKatie Taylor, Mike Tyson, Ariel Helwani, Jake Paul, and Amanda Serrano speak onstage at the press conference in promotion for the upcoming Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match at The Apollo Theater on May 13, 2024, in New York City. (Sarah Stier/Getty Images for Netflix) \u00b7 Sarah Stier via Getty Images\nSince the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged roughly 85%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.\nStory Continues\nLast week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.\nNetflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyonc\u00e9 will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.\nThe company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nJefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a \"breakthrough\" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.\nBofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, \"Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.\"\nNetflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.\nStill, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat \u2014 a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.\n\"With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.\nValuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock \"is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025.\" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "Think about the last time you listened to music on Spotify, watched a movie on Netflix, hailed a ride on Uber, or ordered food via DoorDash. These companies have millions of digital customers\u2014and billions of interactions with them. They are using the insights from this data to rapidly optimize each customer\u2019s next experience.\nIn the age of artificial intelligence, competitive advantage is increasingly determined by a company's ability to deliver personalized experiences at scale. We call this phenomenon the \u201cpersonalization advantage,\u201d which can be expressed by a simple formula:\nP = n \u00d7 v2\nP represents the competitive advantage of personalization.\nN is the volume of interactions from which the company can learn.\nV is the speed of learning, which has an exponential impact.\nThe Personalization Advantage formula illustrates why these companies are winning: they have both scale (n) in terms of customer interactions and speed (v) in learning from and acting on these interactions.\nPersonalization is not just customization\u2014it\u2019s about using customer data to deliver experiences tailored in real-time, evolving with each interaction. Whether it's a website suggesting products you didn't know you needed based on prior behavior, a call center agent knowing your shopping history with the company, or a sales associate remembering your preferences, the key is scaling these interactions across millions of customers and constantly learning from them.\nPersonalization is creating experiences at scale that get fine-tuned with each successive interaction, empowering customers to get what they want better, faster, cheaper, or more easily. The difference lies in the way personalized communications build on everything the company learns about the customer over time, and about how other customers like them behave. In our experience across industries and consumer contexts, this is what makes personalization truly effective. This effectiveness is directly linked to the Personalization Advantage formula. The more interactions a company has (n), and the faster it can learn from them (v), the greater its personalization advantage (P) becomes.\nIt is enabled by the many different forms of AI available: machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and others, often combined together. Business is now effectively at the point where competitive advantage will be based on a company\u2019s ability to relentlessly capture, analyze, and utilize customer data, at a massive scale, with every possible contact\u2014and on how it uses that data to understand, shape, personalize, and optimize each customer\u2019s journey.\nStory Continues\nBuilding economies of scale has always been important in business, especially in the physical aspects of competition: supply chains, production, and distribution. However, personalization changes the nature of scale in the customer experience from the mass production of goods to the mass delivery of 1:1 experiences built on accumulated intelligence. Personalization at scale, and the ongoing cycle of experimentation and learning that power it, create a competitive moat that is very hard to replicate. This competitive moat is precisely what our Personalization Advantage formula quantifies.\nIt\u2019s about scale (n)\nCompanies such as Alipay, Amazon, Tencent, Flipkart, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify have each amassed over 200 million active users. The sheer size of their digital customer base is enormous. They distill insights about these users not just when they transact, but every time they browse or click in a digital channel. But even non-digital native companies are maximizing the \u201csurface area\u201d they have for gathering and using customer information\u2014like an alarm company understanding how homeowners use their touchpads or B2B distributors tracking the frequency and nature of replenishment orders.\nThese companies even know the lifetime value of each new active user they add\u2014and invest accordingly. For example, a large food and beverage company we\u2019ve worked with estimated that each 10 million new digital customer relationships would add $1 billion in incremental revenue.\nIt\u2019s about speed (v)\nUltimately, personalization is about what companies do with the insights about their customers. This is where companies are competing on speed. Speed in getting to know the customer throughout the customer journey, speed in executing based on a trigger about a customer, and speed in constantly improving the experience based on that knowledge. We are big believers in the importance of \u201ctime-based competition,\u201d the concept of competing on the basis of speed. In personalization, it is foundational.\nThe squared term in our formula (v2) emphasizes the outsized impact of speed. Doubling the speed of learning and execution more than doubles the personalization advantage.\nIt is no coincidence that companies across a wide swath of categories, including home improvement, banking, restaurants, grocery, and apparel have publicly announced that personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences are central to their corporate strategy. These companies understand that maximizing both (n) and (v) in the Personalization Advantage formula is crucial for their success.\nBy studying hundreds of personalization leaders over the past decade, we have even quantified the size of the personalization advantage pioneering companies are capturing in terms of growth. Across industries, we find that personalization leaders consistently outgrow laggards. In fact, leaders grow top-line revenues 10 points faster per year than laggards. Taken together, we estimate that by the end of this decade, the personalization leaders, on a combined basis, will capture almost $2 trillion in incremental growth.\nThe basis of competition has shifted\u2014and the prize for those that rethink their business model accordingly is enormous. But here\u2019s the catch. Our research also finds that only 10% of companies qualify as personalization leaders. Many businesses say they are doing personalization but fail to go beyond basic segmented marketing. They end up sending more spam, generating more calls from complaining customers, and frustrating themselves with slower growth than expected. These laggards are failing to optimize both (n) and (v) in the personalization advantage formula, limiting their growth potential.\nMore must-read\u00a0commentary\u00a0published by\u00a0Fortune:\nShell\u2019s Pyrrhic victory may well set the stage for more corporate climate accountability\nDemis Hassabis-James Manyika: AI will help us understand the very fabric of reality\nI worked with Steve Jobs.

The stock slip comes amid Nvidia\u2019s stellar performance last week, which exceeded expectations.\nAs reported by South China Morning Post, China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen met with Nvidia's executive vice president of worldwide field operation responsible for NVIDIA's global business, Jay Puri, on Monday, November 25th. Puri\u2019s meeting highlighted China\u2019s importance as a key market for Nvidia. Meanwhile, Minister Wang Shouwen highlighted opportunities for foreign businesses in an open China, welcoming Nvidia to deepen its ties within the country, according to a statement.\nNvidia (NVDA) Stock Slips Amid Growing Geopolitical and Market Pressure\nThe meeting comes ahead of an expected escalation of US restrictions on China\u2019s semiconductor industry, which could be announced early this week. It is anticipated that the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden will soon impose another round of export restrictions on China, with new regulations potentially adding up to 200 Chinese chip companies to a trade blacklist, Reuters reports. Moreover, it is expected that further US curbs on shipments of high-bandwidth memory chips to China will be unveiled next month.\nIt seems that investors are pricing in these risks, with the news adding to market uncertainty. Amid these risks, the challenge for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) now lies in living up to the market\u2019s sky-high expectations.\u00a0 Wall Street expects a 54% revenue growth for Nvidia in 2025.\u00a0 While it is true that the demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips continues to gain momentum, minor setbacks or uncertainties can prove detrimental to the stock due to such expectations.\nIf the pressure on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) wasn\u2019t already enough, the chip stock is also competing with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 30%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world-leading GPU designer whose products are powering the artificial intelligence industry. Since the release of ChatGPT to the public, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have gained 730%, making it clear that AI is baked into the firm's hypothesis. The firm's fortunes depend on its ability to not only design the best-performing chips but also to sustainably and predictably ship them in high volumes to customers while keeping margins high. Consequently, any turbulence on either the product design, shipping, or cost control fronts leads to tailwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares. Additionally, the high demand for its chips has meant that big tech is eager to find alternatives. The urgency for alternatives is also making companies design in-house AI chips, such as those from Amazon. As a result, unless NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) maintains its performance edge and logistics capabilities, the firm might see trouble in the future.\nPolen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\"In a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Think of it as a kind of complement to video- and image-generating models like Stability AI\u2019s Stable Video Diffusion or OpenAI\u2019s Sora.\n\u201cThe foundational improvement here is that \u2026 we're able to synthesize audio using language, and that, I think, opens up new prospects for tools that people can use to create amazing audio,\u201d Catanzaro added.\nAccording to Nvidia, Fugatto is the first foundational model with emergent properties, which means it\u2019s able to mix the elements it\u2019s been trained on and follow \u201cfree-form instructions.\u201d\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang before a baseball game between the San Francisco Giants and the Arizona Diamondbacks in San Francisco, on Sept. 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe model can generate audio via standard word prompts as well as manipulate audio files that you upload. So if you have a file of a person speaking, you could translate that person\u2019s words to another language while still making it sound like their voice. You could also take a simple tune and make it sound like an orchestral performance or add different beats to music.\nYou can also upload a document and have the model read it in any voice you\u2019d like. What\u2019s more, you can tell the model to produce voices that carry emotional weight. Want audio of a dejected English teacher reading Edgar Allen Poe? Fugatto should be able to do it.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nCatanzaro, however, warns that the model isn\u2019t always perfect. And some results are better than others.\nLike generative image and video models, Fugatto raises questions about the potential impact on artists, sound engineers, and people in related fields. Catanzaro, though, says he hopes the technology helps musicians.\nStory Continues\n\"I hope what it means is new tools for artists to explore,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think audio has always been a fruitful place for exploration. You know, when we get new tools for audio, sometimes we get new forms of music.\u201d\nRead more: Nvidia's market value is up 195% over 11 months. Is it still a good time to invest?\nThat\u2019s certainly true. The guitar gave rise to blues and rock, while turntables helped birth hip-hop as we know it today. The entertainment industry, however, has a rocky relationship with AI.\nThe Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA fought Hollywood studios over fears that the studios would use AI to cut writing jobs or replicate actors\u2019 and actresses\u2019 likenesses. The labor unions reached deals with the studios last year to limit the use of the technology.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAnalyst Recommends Selling Nvidia (NVDA) Amid Growth, Super Micro Concerns: \u2018You Don\u2019t Stay On Top Forever\u2019\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nMark Yusko, Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO & CIO, is recommending investors sell Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Yusko explained his bear thesis on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) during a program on CNBC:\nStory Continues\n\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember that Intel stock went up 20 fold over 10 years because their chip was going to revolutionize AI in 2000 and today that stock is 63% lower than it was 24 years ago. So you don\u2019t stay on top forever and Nvidia came along and invented GPU and now we got TPUs and VPUs and LPUs. So I think innovation will keep rolling but the thing I\u2019m most worried about with Nvidia, their third largest customer is about to get delisted. That\u2019s a big story.\u201d\nAsked how Super Micro (SMCI) delisting could impact Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the analyst said:\n\u201cWell if it\u2019s your third largest customer and they actually haven\u2019t, they don\u2019t have the capacity to continue to be your third largest customer, what happens to your revenue growth and profits growth? I, you know, we\u2019ve seen this movie before with Nell and Cisco back in 2020. So I don\u2019t know, that makes me nervous.\u201d\nSimply beating earnings estimates is not enough for Nvidia anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia\u2019s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers \u2014 which account for 50% of its revenue \u2014 are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn a reversal from the past two quarters,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nRead Also:\u00a010 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

          "whole_article": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 72.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 123.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -28.1%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 2.2%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.9% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nRead Also:\u00a010 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks. With that in context, let\u2019s take a look at the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is Supposedly Launching Its Next Major Gemini 2.0 Model, Set for December Release\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNo. of Hedge Funds: 202\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is a global leader in digital services and technology innovation. The company\u2019s vast ecosystem includes search, YouTube, Android, and Google Cloud. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) investments in AI, autonomous vehicles (through Waymo), and other disruptive technologies underscore its forward-thinking strategy.\nOn October 29, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30. The company\u2019s Q3 revenues increased 15% year over year to $88.3 billion, driven by strong momentum across all business segments. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, driven by Google Search, Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices, and YouTube ads. The company\u2019s Cloud segment\u2019s revenue increased 35% to $11.4 billion, due to accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) net income increased 34% to $26.30 billion. The company\u2019s YouTube segment revenues increased from $7.95 billion to $8.92 billion, which provides a valuable diversification from its traditional Google Search ad revenue.\nWhile Waymo, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) autonomous driving segment, may not be the company\u2019s strongest growth driver, Waymo is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for autonomous vehicles. On November 12, CNBC reported that Waymo opened its robotaxi service to the general public in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet. The service, which was previously available to a limited number of users, is now accessible to anyone in LA through the Waymo One app, covering nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County.\nThis expansion follows the company\u2019s previous launches in Phoenix and San Francisco and brings the total number of cities with fully available robotaxi services to three. With over 3.8 million people, LA is the largest city to offer Waymo\u2019s robotaxi service, providing a significant opportunity for growth and adoption.\nWaymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the past year. In October, the company closed a $5.6 billion funding round to expand its robotaxi service across the United States. As a result, Waymo has seen a significant increase in paid rides across its three markets, with over 150,000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app, up from 100,000 in August. Additionally, Waymo has partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025, and has agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai to add the Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 4th\u00a0\u00a0on our list of best climate change stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge threw cold water on one of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s key arguments in a Department of Justice lawsuit over allegations that Google monopolized advertising technology.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City\u2019s \u2018Living Breakwaters\u2019 Brace for Stormier Seas\nIn Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women\u2019s Sports Takes the Field\nNYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future\nNYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge\nDuring closing arguments in the lawsuit against the tech giant, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema said that she disagreed with Google\u2019s attempts to rely on an earlier antitrust case involving American Express Co. The judge interrupted Google\u2019s lawyer Monday to say that she had carefully studied a 2018 Supreme Court decision in the older case.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a completely different setup\u201d here compared to Amex, she said on the closing day of the trial in Alexandria, Virginia.\nThe case is one of several against Google over antitrust issues. In another, the Justice Department is seeking to force Alphabet to sell off its Chrome browser after winning a landmark ruling that company illegally monopolized online search.\nIn Monday\u2019s case, the Justice Department and a group of states sued Google in 2023, arguing the company illegally monopolized three separate markets for advertising technology: sell-side tools used by websites, called ad servers; advertising exchanges; and buy-side tools used by advertisers known as ad networks. The company has countered by saying that splitting its tools into those buckets is wrong and its business is better understood as a single market in which website publishers and advertisers transact.\nBrinkema\u2019s interjection came as Google lawyers were citing the American Express case, where the Supreme Court ruled that judges should look at how a product or service impacts different groups of customers. Google argues that some of its conduct \u2014 which the Justice Department said harmed website publishers \u2014 can be justified because it was intended to help advertisers.\nBrinkema said she has \u201cproblems\u201d applying the ruling related to the credit card market to Google.\nBut Google\u2019s lawyer, Karen Dunn, argued that the company\u2019s ad tech tools serve a similar function to credit cards by seeking to \u201cmatch\u201d buyers and sellers of online ads.\nThe tools act to \u201cfacilitate transactions between buyers and sellers,\u201d she said. You \u201ccan\u2019t look at one side in isolation.\u201d\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Justin Teresi, who attended Monday\u2019s arguments, said he believes Brinkema will rule in favor of the government based on a different legal argument.\nStory Continues\n\u201cA liability finding is likely on some claims \u2014 most notably those involving the publisher ad server and tying,\u201d said Teresi, who focuses on antitrust litigation and policy.\nThe Justice Department argued Monday that the Amex decision only applies to credit card transaction platforms, not all markets where a company does business with two sets of customers. For example, courts haven\u2019t held that for newspapers, which sell ads to advertisers and news to consumers.\n\u201cGoogle is once, twice, three times a monopolist,\u201d Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum said. The company\u2019s \u201cinternal documents make clear it\u2019s three markets and not one.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s Dunn said that US antitrust law allows the company to decide whether to make its products work with that of competitors. Forcing Google to provide technology and resources to make ad tech work seamlessly with rival tools would stifle innovation, she said.\nBrinkema, who has previously said she plans to issue a decision by the end of the year, didn\u2019t give an update on timing.\n(Updates with additional details on argument beginning in eighth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\nClear\u2019s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End\nAn Airline\u2019s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

And then, phase three of this will ultimately be the consumer-facing companies figuring out how to use the technology in ways that actually can drive increased interactions with consumers.\"\nThe analyst says the market will enter phase two in 2025, with software companies and cloud provider stocks expected to see gains. He adds that cybersecurity companies could also benefit as the technology evolves.\nRelated Videos\n01:49\nHow to play apparel stocks under Trump: Nike, Steve Madden, ON\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n04:51\nBitcoin is taking a breather.

          "whole_article": "A \u00a37 billion legal claim against Google which accuses the tech giant of exploiting its dominant position in the search engine market can proceed to trial, the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) has ruled.\nThe multi-billion claim, brought by consumer rights campaigner Nikki Stopford, claims the US giant exploited its dominance in the search market to increase advertising costs, which were ultimately passed on to consumers.\nThe legal claim also accuses the company of abusing its position in the market by forcing mobile phone manufacturers who use Google\u2019s Android operating system to pre-install apps for Google Search and the firm\u2019s web browser, Chrome, on to handsets, and paying Apple to ensure that Google is the default search engine on its devices, including the iPhone.\nThe tribunal judgment dismissed Google\u2019s arguments for having the claim struck out, and certified the claim, which can now proceed to trial.\nAs the class representative in the action, Ms Stopford will represent all UK-domiciled consumers aged 16 and over who purchased goods or services from a business selling in the UK which used search advertising services provided by Google.\nThe action is being brought as an opt-out collective action, meaning that everyone in the UK affected is automatically included as a claimant in the case unless they opt out.\n\u201cThis green light from the tribunal is a significant victory for UK consumers,\u201d Ms Stopford said.\n\u201cAlmost everybody uses Google as their go-to search engine, trusting it to deliver quality results at no cost. But its service isn\u2019t genuinely free because its dominance has resulted in increased costs for consumers.\n\u201cGoogle has been warned repeatedly by competition regulators. Yet it continues to rig the market to charge advertisers more, which raises the prices they charge consumers.\n\u201cThis action seeks to promote healthier competition in digital markets, and to hold Google accountable and ensure that consumers are compensated for the harm caused by its conduct.\u201d\nThe decision is the latest setback for the tech giant, coming after the US Department of Justice proposed that the company be forced to sell its Chrome web browser, among other remedies, after a US judge ruled earlier this year that the business ran a monopoly in search.\nIn response to the CAT ruling, a Google spokesman said: \u201c\u201cWe still believe this case is speculative and opportunistic \u2013 we will argue against it vigorously.\n\u201cPeople use Google because it is helpful; not because there are no alternatives.\u201d"

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- A Texas land company founded during the Wild West era more than a century ago is becoming an unlikely beneficiary of market euphoria over artificial intelligence.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City\u2019s \u2018Living Breakwaters\u2019 Brace for Stormier Seas\nIn Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women\u2019s Sports Takes the Field\nNYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future\nNYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge\nDallas-based Texas Pacific Land Corp., which employs 100 people, has seen its stock more than triple this year, giving it a market value of almost $40 billion. That\u2019s bigger than Halliburton Co., the largest oilfield servicer in North America, and asset manager State Street Corp. It\u2019s more than four times the size of American Airlines Group Inc., which is based in nearby Fort Worth and has over 100,000 workers.\nBitcoin mines, utility-scale batteries and renewable power are already being built on TPL\u2019s 873,000 acres in West Texas, an area bigger than Yosemite National Park. But that could be just the beginning. The swath of land in the oil-rich Permian Basin, where natural gas costs almost nothing, is an opportunity for tech giants like Google owner Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. to access cheap electricity for energy-hungry servers.\nTPL\u2019s shares surged 14% Friday on the news that the company would replace Marathon Oil Corp. in the S&P 500.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversations taking place within the industry and definitely within TPL\u201d about leasing land to data centers, TPL Chief Executive Officer Tyler Glover said this month in a conference call with investors. \u201cWe feel that we\u2019re positioned as well as anyone in West Texas to provide land and water solutions as those opportunities unfold.\u201d\nAI\u2019s potential to revolutionize how people live, work and play has been the driving force behind the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 50% rise over the past two years. But to realize the real-world profits implied by their stock valuations, Big Tech is plowing money into physical infrastructure. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. are expected to spend more than $200 billion next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, much of it on data centers.\n\u201cA lot of different sectors will be on the receiving end of that,\u201d said Greg Halter, who helps manage $4 billion as director of research at Carnegie Investment Counsel. \u201cYou have these oddball entities being revived because all of a sudden they have something valuable.\u201d\nA spokesperson for TPL declined to comment. The company\u2019s shares have jumped 230% this year to trade at $1,730 on Friday.\nStory Continues\nThe high-tech rally is a long way from TPL\u2019s roots as a trust founded in 1888 to repay bondholders who financed a failed attempt to build a railway from East Texas to San Diego during westward expansion. The trust gained 3.5 million acres, an area the size of Connecticut, and slowly sold them off to repay creditors over the following century. But land in the dry, sparsely populated western part of the Permian Basin proved hardest to sell.\nThe acreage turned out to be a multibillion-dollar stroke of good fortune. As the shale revolution took off in the 2000s, that land \u2014 and the associated mineral rights \u2014 became incredibly valuable. TPL now receives nearly $100 million a quarter in royalties from oil producers like Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips while paying nothing toward the cost of their wells. It earned a further $80 million from water sales and fees for companies using its land in the most recent quarter, contributing to an 83% profit margin.\nAt least one other Texas landowner has gotten a boost from investor enthusiasm about AI. LandBridge Co., which owns about 220,000 acres in the Permian, has surged more than threefold since its initial public offering in June. The company agreed to buy more land this month in a deal that would expand its acreage by 20%, citing the potential for \u201cdigital infrastructure and renewable energy projects.\u201d\nAlong with TPL and LandBridge, utility and power stocks are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI surge, with Vistra Corp, GE Vernova Inc. and Constellation Energy Corp. all in the top 10 S&P 500 performers this year. Pipelines, which provide gas to power plants, are also flying. Kinder Morgan Inc., Oneok Inc. and Targa Resources Corp. are all up more than 50% this year.\n\u201cThis is the AI-adjacent pick and shovel trade,\u201d said Kevin Simpson, who helps manage $11 billion, including TPL shares, as chief executive officer of Capital Wealth Planning LLC. \u201cThese are not obscene valuations if the data center thesis plays out.\u201d\nNow investors are thinking further ahead. With a ChatGPT query using nearly ten times as much electricity as a Google search, US data center power demand is expected to grow about 170% by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u201cThis increased demand will help drive the kind of electricity growth that hasn\u2019t been seen in a generation,\u201d the bank said in May.\nSam Altman, founder of ChatGPT owner OpenAI, has pitched the idea of five-gigawatt centers. That could require millions of square feet of space and enough energy to light up many US cities. There\u2019s concern that the electricity needs of data centers will put climate goals at risk as companies turn to fossil fuels to power them.\nThe Permian appears well placed to fill at least some of the energy demand. The basin produces enormous quantities of natural gas as byproduct of oil, filling pipelines to capacity. Much of the excess is burned into the atmosphere in a process known as flaring. Gas at the basin's Waha hub traded for 96% less than the US benchmark on average over the past year, and Permian gas prices actually went negative more than once this year as producers paid for the fuel to be taken off their hands.\nMomentum is now gathering behind the idea that this cheap, abundant gas could be used for power plants, which in turn could supply energy to data centers, crypto mines and the oil field. Still, the market for some AI-adjacent stocks may be getting frothy, at least in the near term. Capital Wealth Planning\u2019s Simpson said he recently trimmed his position in TPL by a third after the stock soared 40% in a month.\nIt\u2019s too soon to say whether the TPL\u2019s land will soon be home to sprawling data centers, according to CEO Glover. But the company is in prime position to benefit from AI\u2019s expansion, he said.\n\u201cTPL just has a lot of positive attributes for data centers,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody has more land than us in West Texas.\u201d\n--With assistance from Dave Merrill and Josh Saul.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\nClear\u2019s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End\nAn Airline\u2019s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "By Jody Godoy and David Shepardson\nALEXANDRIA, Virginia (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department told a federal judge Alphabet's Google illegally dominated online advertising technology in seeking a second antitrust win against the company.\nThe closing arguments in Alexandria, Virginia, cap a 15-day trial held in September where prosecutors sought to show Google monopolized markets for publisher ad servers and advertiser ad networks, and tried to dominate the market for ad exchanges which sit between buyers and sellers.\n\u201cGoogle rigged the rules of the road,\u201d said DOJ lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum, who asked the judge to hold Google accountable for anticompetitive conduct and added Google is \"once, twice, three times a monopolist.\"\nAnother DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood compared the case to the Charles Dickens novel \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and said U.S. Judge Leonie Brinkema had to decide whether to adopt the DOJ or Google version of the state of the ad market.\nGoogle lawyer Karen Dunn said DOJ had not met its legal burden and was asking Brinkema to disregard antitrust and overrule key precedents. \"The law simply does not support what the plaintiffs are arguing in this case,\" Dunn said.\nShe argued DOJ was ignoring Google's legitimate business decisions and that the online advertising market was robust. The company argues the government had cherrypicked a narrow slice of the online market and did not account for aggressive competition.\nAlphabet shares were up 1.4% in afternoon trading.\nPublishers testified at trial that they could not switch away from Google, even when it rolled out features they disliked, since there was no other way to access the huge advertising demand within Google's ad network.\nNews Corp in 2017 estimated losing at least $9 million in ad revenue that year if it had switched away, one witness said.\nIf Brinkema finds that Google broke the law, she would consider prosecutors' request to make Google at least sell off Google Ad Manager, a platform that includes the company's publisher ad server and its ad exchange.\nGoogle offered to sell the ad exchange this year to end an EU antitrust investigation but European publishers rejected the proposal as insufficient, Reuters first reported in September.\nAnalysts view the ad tech case as a smaller financial risk than the case where a judge ruled Google maintains an illegal monopoly in online search, and where prosecutors have argued the company must be forced to sell its Chrome browser.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York and David Shepardson in Alexandria, Virginia; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Jonathan Oatis and Chizu Nomiyama)"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nDan Niles: Microsoft (MSFT) Should \u2018Worry\u2019 You\nPieter Beens / Shutterstock.com\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nDan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, in a recent program on CNBC discussed Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0and said the stock should \u201cworry\u201d you amid declining Cloud growth and valuation.\nStory Continues\n\u201cThe one that should worry you is Microsoft, and the reason I say that is we\u2019ve all heard of OpenAI and ChatGPT, which really kicked all this off at the end of calendar 2022. Obviously, Microsoft has a huge stake in OpenAI. But if you look at the numbers for Microsoft, their June quarter Azure, which is their cloud business, was growing 35%. Then that went to 34% in the September quarter, and they guided to 31% to 32%. So the numbers are going down. If you look at Amazon, their cloud business has actually accelerated over the last five quarters, from 12% to 19% growth. They\u2019re the biggest. And if you look at Google, which is the smallest of them, their growth accelerated from 29% last quarter to 35% in the quarter they just reported. So you\u2019ve got to ask yourself: is Microsoft actually getting a return for all this money that they\u2019re investing?\u201d\nNiles said Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0P/E of 33 is also higher than the market\u2019s 24 and that should also concern investors.\nMicrosoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0shares recently fell after the company reported its latest quarterly results. Analysts believe most of the revenue beat came from PC segment, while investors were paying more attention to AI and Azure. Azure\u2019s 34% growth met expectations, though guidance for next quarter fell short, projecting between 31% and 32% growth\u20141 percentage point below forecasts. This dip is attributed to delays in data center capacity from third-party providers, though Azure\u2019s consumption trends remained steady.\nInvestors hoping for a rebound in IT spending were likely disappointed, as stable Azure consumption suggests no significant uptick in the second half of the year. In addition, the lower-than-expected Q2 guidance underscored tempered growth expectations.\nAI services, however, contributed a robust 12 points to Azure\u2019s growth, a steady continuation from the previous quarter. Microsoft\u2019s management confirmed strong demand for AI services, although supply constraints are limiting further expansion. Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0anticipates AI-related revenues, including M365 Copilot and Azure AI, could reach $10 billion annually by next quarter\u2014making it one of the fastest-growing segments in Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s history.\nCarillon Eagle Growth & Income Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(MSFT) traded lower following concerns about the sustainability of its data center buildout for generative artificial intelligence (AI). The company continues to show strong growth in its cloud segment, and management highlighted optimism surrounding demand signals.\u201d\nOverall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Microsoft's Death Cross: Tech Giant Faces A Double Blow With FTC Pressure\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), the heavyweight of Big Tech, has hit a grim milestone in technical analysis: a Death Cross.\nWith its share price slipping below key moving averages, MSFT stock has moved into bearish territory, casting doubts on its near-term prospects. Is this just a blip for the software giant, or the prelude to deeper woes?\nChart created using Benzinga Pro\nMSFT Stock: Bearish Signals All Around\nAt $418.19, MSFT stock price trails its 20-day, 50-day and even the 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). Technical indicators are sounding alarms:\nThe 20-day SMA at $418.73, the 50-day SMA at $421.65 and the 200-day SMA at $421.81 all point to a bearish signal.\nThe eight-day SMA at $417.37, continues to be driven by bullish sentiment over the short term, driven by buying pressure.\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stands at -1.11, another red flag.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 49.09 suggests that Microsoft isn't oversold yet but is heading toward bearish momentum.\nThese technical markers paint a strongly bearish picture. Yet, buying pressure persists, indicating that investors still see potential for a turnaround\u2014a glimmer of bullish hope amidst the gloom.\nRead Also: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\nThe ProPublica Bombshell\nCompounding Microsoft's technical woes is a ProPublica investigation that has raised ethical and legal concerns over the company\u2019s federal contracting practices. As detailed in the report, Microsoft's \"White House Offer\"\u2014a supposedly altruistic pledge to bolster government cybersecurity\u2014was a calculated business maneuver.\nThe plan involved providing free upgrades and consulting services to federal agencies, locking them into Microsoft's ecosystem. Once the \"free\" period ended, agencies had little choice but to continue with costly subscriptions and Azure services, effectively squeezing out competitors.\nThis strategy not only strengthened Microsoft's grip on federal business but also invited scrutiny for potentially violating federal procurement and antitrust laws. Legal experts argue that the deal sidesteps open competition, raising concerns about its long-term implications for government reliance on a single vendor.\nA Double-Edged Sword\nWhile the technical indicators signal bearishness, the buying pressure suggests a tug-of-war between short-term skepticism and long-term optimism. Microsoft's market dominance\u2014bolstered by its lucrative cloud business and strategic maneuvers\u2014remains a formidable moat.\nStory Continues\nHowever, the ethical controversies surrounding its federal contracts could dent investor confidence and invite regulatory headwinds.\nThe Verdict\nMicrosoft's Death Cross is a wake-up call for investors. With the stock under technical pressure and the ProPublica revelations casting a shadow over its business practices, the path forward is murky.\nBulls might see this as a chance to buy on weakness, banking on Microsoft's resilience. Bears, however, have a compelling case to remain cautious as the stock navigates this precarious juncture.\nFor now, Microsoft's crossroads is a reminder that even the mightiest of tech giants are not immune to scrutiny\u2014or the market's harsh judgment.\nCheck It Out:\nArrived Achieved A Total Return of 34.7% On Their Biggest Sale Yet \u2014 Diversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio.\nIn October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nRead Also:\u00a010 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

          "whole_article": "Elon Musk\u2019s go-to legal strategy for the many lawsuits he and his sprawling business empire have filed over the years can be summed up in a few words: Spend and intimidate opponents into submission.\nThe billionaire uses his deep pockets to drag out cases until his adversaries run low on money, legal experts say. Or he uses the courts to punish critics and instill fear in anyone merely considering speaking out against him.\nIn the past month alone, Musk\u2019s companies have filed two new lawsuits against California state officials. One, by SpaceX, alleges the state\u2019s coastal commission retaliated against Musk for his support of Donald Trump by blocking the space cargo company from launching more of its rockets. Another lawsuit by his social media service X, formerly Twitter, takes aim at a new state law that requires it to police its service for election-related deepfake videos, or videos created with the help of artificial intelligence.\nMeanwhile, Musk also filed his third in a succession of complaints against OpenAI, the buzzy company behind the ChatGPT chatbot that he cofounded but with which he later had a falling-out. In this updated version, he roped OpenAI investor Microsoft into the case, accusing the tech giant of violating antitrust law with its multibillion-dollar investment in the AI startup.\nMost of the suits Musk files target threats to his companies. In his eyes, litigation is just a cost of doing business that\u2019s built into what he charges customers, says Joan MacLeod Heminway, a University of Tennessee law professor who in August published a paper about Musk\u2019s litigiousness, titled Representing Elon Musk.\n\u201cHe really just sees litigation as part of his business model in some ways,\u201d Heminway says.\nMusk\u2019s legal tactics are similar to those of some other wealthy and litigious plaintiffs, notes Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. They put high-priced law firms on speed dial, deliberately file cases in friendly courts, and are more than happy to attack small defendants like nonprofits, even if they may not win.\n\u201cThe point is to pressure people to do what you want them to do,\u201d says Barrett, adding that the tactic requires a \u201ccertain shamelessness.\u201d\nMusk and several of his outside attorneys did not respond to requests for comment nor did representatives from X and SpaceX.\nMusk\u2019s new best friend, President-elect Trump, is also known for starting aggressive and lengthy legal battles. Recently, Trump\u2019s lawyer sent letters to publishers about unflattering reporting, demanding $10 billion in damages from the New York Times and Penguin Random House for \u201cfalse and defamatory statements.\u201d Leading up to the election, Trump threatened government force and legal action against a variety of enemies, from critical journalists to former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). But as is typical with his threats, Trump didn\u2019t carry through.\nStory Continues\nIn Musk\u2019s case, part of his legal strategy is to move his businesses from California to places like Texas, which have lighter regulations and more sympathetic judges. Earlier this year, he announced that X and SpaceX would move their headquarters from California to near Austin, citing his opposition to a California law supporting LGBTQ+ youth in schools. He\u2019s also changed X\u2019s terms of service in a way that may help protect it from lawsuits. As of Nov. 15, any X users who want to file their own lawsuits against the social media company must do so in Texas, either in federal court or state court, where judges are considered to be more pro-business.\nAnother big part of Musk\u2019s modus operandi is to hire expensive lawyers who aren\u2019t afraid to take on more \u201ccreative\u201d cases, as Heminway put it. Some of his lawsuits involve legal gymnastics that are untested in court, but he can easily afford to plow ahead anyway when others would think twice about spending the money, she said.\n\u201cHe's not afraid to hire people who will reach into areas of law to try and find things that he needs, to either defend against or to bring cases against others,\u201d Heminway notes.\nIn one case targeting the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), for example, X accused the nonprofit of illegally scraping user data from X to inform its report that criticized Musk\u2019s decision to reinstate users who had previously been banned for misbehavior on the service. A federal judge rejected X\u2019s claim and dismissed the case, saying it was merely an effort to silence critics, known in legal circles as a SLAPP.\n\u201cX Corp. has brought this case in order to punish CCDH for CCDH publications that criticized X Corp.\u2014and perhaps in order to dissuade others who might wish to engage in such criticism,\u201d Federal Judge Charles Breyer wrote in his ruling. X has appealed the case.\nX filed a similar lawsuit in Texas against Media Matters for America over its report that the platform displayed hateful content alongside digital ads from major companies, including Disney. While similar to the CCDH fight, Federal Judge Reed O\u2019Connor didn\u2019t dismiss the case in an August order, finding instead that X \u201chas properly pled its claims.\u201d\nMusk also likes to drag out litigation. Like many moneyed plaintiffs, he\u2019s willing to outspend his opponents and squeeze them into settling. As one lawyer who is currently litigating against Musk puts it, \u201cBy definition, he has the deepest pockets that any litigant will ever have.\u201d\nUsing the grind to his advantage\nThe legal experts suggest that the tech billionaire\u2019s goal isn\u2019t necessarily to win in court: Instead, as the attorney put it, \u201cHe wants people to be afraid to criticize him.\u201d\nThe attorney, who asked not to be named in order to protect client identities amid ongoing litigation, summed up Musk\u2019s strategy as, \u201c\u2018I have more resources than you do, so I\u2019m going to use those resources to make everything into a grind.\u2019\u201d\nThe tactic has yielded results: After an appeal, X blocked at least part of a California law that required companies to police content on their services. Musk himself in August ended his lengthy custody battle against Grimes, his former partner with whom he has three children and who has previously said she was \u201cgoing bankrupt\u201d amid the ongoing litigation.\nTaking on regulation\nMusk\u2019s latest litigation challenges a new California law, AB 2655, that targets AI-generated deepfakes in deceptive election content. California Gov. Gavin Newsom promised to take action in July in response to Musk retweeting a post that used a deepfake of Vice President Kamala Harris talking about how she\u2019s unqualified to be president.\nIn its filings, X argued the new law is overly broad and chills political speech. The law requires social media platforms to remove and block \u201cmaterially deceptive\u201d content related to elections and candidates during campaigning, and to set up ways for users to label and report deepfakes.\n\u201cIt is difficult to imagine a statute more in conflict with core First Amendment principles,\u201d lawyers for X wrote in its complaint.\nThis year, X scored a partial win by blocking a different California measure that would have required social media companies to disclose their policies about hate speech and content moderation. The social media company\u2019s effort, based on a First Amendment argument, was initially denied by a federal judge. But an appeals court later sided with X, ruling that requiring social media companies to report their enforcement efforts to the government was likely unconstitutional. The lower court will decide whether other facets of the law can still be enforced.\nSpaceX also in October took on the California Coastal Commission, accusing it of political discrimination after it blocked Musk\u2019s company from continuing to launch rockets from a military base on the state\u2019s central coast. The company\u2019s complaint alleges that the vote \u201cwas not based on concerns about impacts to coastal resources, but instead on the political views held by SpaceX\u2019s largest shareholder and CEO, Elon Musk.\u201d\nUnfriendly competition\nMusk, a cofounder and now competitor of OpenAI, with his xAI startup, has also gone to court to accuse ChatGPT company\u2019s CEO Sam Altman and president Greg Brockman of prioritizing profits over its purported interest in benefiting humanity.\nMusk\u2019s claims against OpenAI have grown over the past year; the first iteration of the lawsuit was filed in California state court in February. He dropped the lawsuit in June then refiled in federal court in August.\nMicrosoft was added to a third version of the lawsuit, with Musk now leveling antitrust claims related to the tech giant\u2019s multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI. More broadly, the Federal Trade Commission and other regulators are examining the outsize role of Big Tech firms in AI investment and innovation.\nAccording to Musk\u2019s latest complaint: \u201cOpenAI, Inc., co-founded by Musk as an independent charity committed to safety and transparency\u2014and nurtured in its infancy by Musk\u2019s money, advice, recruiting efforts and connections\u2014is, at the direction of Altman, Brockman, and Microsoft, fast becoming a fully for-profit subsidiary of Microsoft.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s X also brought antitrust claims in August against the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), member companies, and its backer, the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), an ad industry trade group. X argued the defendants acted as a cartel by discouraging members from advertising on its service over concerns about brand safety standards. Three days after the lawsuit was filed, WFA shut down GARM, citing the litigation\u2019s strain on resources. The case is still ongoing, however. And on Thursday, the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched an investigation into WFA citing similar antitrust claims.\nOf course, Musk and his companies also must fend off a torrent of lawsuits from others. He\u2019s had mixed results there.\nTesla settled a discrimination lawsuit over how the business treats Black employees, for example. And earlier this year, just before going to trial, the company settled a five-year-old wrongful death lawsuit over a fatal crash involving its car\u2019s Autopilot technology. Still, the EV company faces at least half-a-dozen more, on top of federal traffic safety investigations.\nIn other cases, Musk\u2019s lawyers have prevailed. Musk\u2019s tweets, alone, are a huge source of litigation based on his controversial statements online. They include cases brought by the National Labor Relations Board over anti-union comments, crypto investors accusing Musk of insider trading, and a British caver Musk described as a \u201cpedo guy.\u201d\nNo matter who initiates the litigation, Musk is for certain one thing: a gold mine to the legal industry. His lengthy track record of suing and being sued, along with his companies, is keeping armies of attorneys employed across the country.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Unlike previous tech booms focused on software, the current AI wave is heavily centered on hardware, which is significantly more capital-intensive. Per the report, big tech companies are projected to spend over $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 nearly double the levels of 2021. These investments primarily target AI infrastructure, from data centers to advanced chips.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe report contends that the shift to hardware-oriented AI development introduces long-term financial risks. AI infrastructure projects often have extended timelines before profitability, making them vulnerable to economic slowdowns, inflation, and geopolitical factors. AI startups, too, face challenges. Their capital-intensive models rely on large funding rounds, with 2024 seeing nearly half of US venture capital allocated to AI. However, per Reuters, economic downturns or high capital costs could restrict funding availability, slowing innovation and reducing demand for AI hardware. Additionally, hardware businesses face cyclical risks, including inventory fluctuations and delayed scalability.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary.\nBut the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments.\nNancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023.\nThe timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit.\nWell, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices.\nAnd now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s.\nAs this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions.\nNancy Pelosi as Investment Guru?\nLet's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024.\nMaybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer.\nGurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list.\nHer most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price.\nOn the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece.\nStory Continues\nIf our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption.\nAnd after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July.\nAnd look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price!\nMeanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025.\nLooking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies.\nUnlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too.\nBut other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 32%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity products and services provider whose Falcon system was at the heart of one of the biggest IT outages earlier this year. Its shares are down 9% since the blackout and have gained 53% since the post-outage bottom. The recovery in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s stock is based on shifting investor attitudes about the firm's subscription revenue and legal implications stemming from the outage. As few legal troubles and customer switching surface, investors are slowly creeping back to CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s stock. However, the firm is continuing to face pressure from Delta Airlines because of the outage as the two companies have sued each other. Apart from the implications of the outage, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s $10 billion recurring revenue guidance for 2031 and a midpoint free cash flow margin guidance of 36% will continue to drive its margin due to the central role that the metrics play in any software company's hypothesis.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall CRWD ranks 4th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Nov. 26.\nFor the third quarter, CrowdStrike projects total revenues between $979.2 million and $984.7 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $982.3 million, which indicates growth of 25% from the year-ago quarter's level.\nCrowdStrike anticipates non-GAAP earnings between 80 cents and 81 cents per share. The consensus mark for the bottom line has been revised a penny downward to 81 cents per share over the past 60 days and indicates a 1.2% year-over-year decline.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company has consistently demonstrated impressive financial performance, underpinned by its subscription-based revenue model. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 9.3%.\nCrowdStrike Price and EPS Surprise\nCrowdStrike Price and EPS Surprise\nCrowdStrike price-eps-surprise | CrowdStrike Quote\nAs CrowdStrike approaches its third-quarter earnings announcement, let\u2019s see if it is the right time to invest in this stock.\nFactors Influencing CrowdStrike\u2019s Q3 Results\nCrowdStrike\u2019s third-quarter results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD\u2019s products in the fiscal third quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.\nStellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the third-quarter top line. The increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Subscription revenues is pegged at $936.6 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 27.7%. However, revenues from the Professional Services segment are likely to decrease 6.7% year over year to $49 million in the third quarter.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s collaboration with Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products\u2019 availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon\u2019s AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD\u2019s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.\nHowever, the July 19 global IT outage incident is likely to have negatively impacted sales growth in the third quarter. During its second-quarter earnings call, CrowdStrike stated that it expects to see an extended sales cycle with additional scrutiny requiring higher management-level approval for new deals by some organizations due to the global IT outage incident.\nStory Continues\nElevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are also likely to have weighed on the company\u2019s fiscal third-quarter bottom line.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Price Performance & Valuation\nYear to date, shares of CrowdStrike have risen 45.8%, underperforming the Zacks Internet \u2013 Software industry\u2019s growth of 31.2%. Compared with other major cybersecurity players, CRWD stock has outperformed Juniper Networks JNPR and Palo Alto Networks PANW but underperformed Fortinet FTNT. JNPR, PANW and FTNT stocks have rallied 21.8%, 30% and 58.5%, respectively, YTD.\nYTD Price Return Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value CrowdStrike offers investors at the current levels. CRWD stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 19.81X compared with the industry\u2019s 2.99X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Thesis for CRWD Stock\nCrowdStrike stock has made a remarkable comeback following the significant dip in its share price triggered by the global IT outage on July 19. The company has adopted proactive measures following the incident, including the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.\nThe Falcon platform\u2019s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike\u2019s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm\u2019s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.\nMoreover, the company's \u201cFalcon Flex\u201d subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.\nDespite these upsides, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, including extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company\u2019s third-quarter guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management\u2019s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.\nConclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now\nWhile CrowdStrike\u2019s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company\u2019s history of strong quarterly performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks.\nNews agency Reuters recently reported that the rise of artificial intelligence is reshaping investment strategies, driving massive capital demands that challenge traditional tech-sector dynamics. Unlike previous tech booms focused on software, the current AI wave is heavily centered on hardware, which is significantly more capital-intensive. Per the report, big tech companies are projected to spend over $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 nearly double the levels of 2021. These investments primarily target AI infrastructure, from data centers to advanced chips.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe report contends that the shift to hardware-oriented AI development introduces long-term financial risks. AI infrastructure projects often have extended timelines before profitability, making them vulnerable to economic slowdowns, inflation, and geopolitical factors. AI startups, too, face challenges. Their capital-intensive models rely on large funding rounds, with 2024 seeing nearly half of US venture capital allocated to AI. However, per Reuters, economic downturns or high capital costs could restrict funding availability, slowing innovation and reducing demand for AI hardware. Additionally, hardware businesses face cyclical risks, including inventory fluctuations and delayed scalability.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations. Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry. Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options. Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: \"It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software \u2014 and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief\u00a0here.

This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Broadcom Inc. is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Broadcom Inc. is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.85. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 35.5.\nMeanwhile, AVGO's PEG ratio is currently 1.63. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Electronics - Semiconductors industry stood at 1.77 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 144, putting it in the bottom 43% of all 250+ industries.\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.\n8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nA close up of a circuit board, its microchips creating a powerful computing system.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNo. of Hedge Funds: 128\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading designer, developer, and supplier of semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions. The company\u2019s diverse product portfolio spans sectors like data centers, networking, broadband, and wireless communication. Broadcom Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) cybersecurity offerings include the Symantec Enterprise Cloud platform and a suite of solutions for payment, mainframe, network, endpoint, and identity security.\nOn September 5, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported financial results for its third quarter which ended August 4. The company reported a 47% year-over-year increase in revenue to $13.1 billion. This growth was driven by strong AI-related revenue, VMware bookings, and robust performance in non-AI semiconductor segments. Looking ahead to Q4, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) anticipates revenue of approximately $14.0 billion\nOn November 5, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced significant advancements in its VeloCloud product portfolio, aimed at supporting the growing adoption of AI and non-AI workloads in enterprises. The company unveiled VeloRAIN, a robust AI networking architecture that leverages AI and machine learning to enhance the performance and security of distributed AI workloads.\nAs part of this announcement, Broadcom Inc.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nBroadcom\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company\u2019s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.\nHowever, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom\u2019s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.\n(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\nMerck\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\nYet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\nShares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.\nStory Continues\nAggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.\nHowever, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space.

An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.\nThe hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.\nAnd while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.\nAnalysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) in the last month.\nHere are the major companies that have become popular shorts.\nPopular short stocks\nS3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.\nStory continues\nChipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.\nThe demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.\nAt the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.\nShares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.\nAnd Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.\nRead more: Rise in UK borrowing shows Reeves has 'little wiggle room' on spending\nThe discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.\nTesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.\nHowever, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve \"slight growth\" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.\nS3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).\nFollowing its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.\nS&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this \"may be related to the [US] election\".\nThey said that despite this significant activity in \"all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses\".\nGlobal short bets\nMeanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.\nThe data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on \"crowdedness\", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors\u2019 supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.\nLVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.\nThe company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an \"uncertain economic and geopolitical environment\" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.\nRead more: FTSE 100 and European-listed stocks to own in 2025, according to Barclays\nThe luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\nKering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.\nShares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.\nMultinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.\nDiageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIt has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.\nIn South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.\nRead more: What we know about planned UK private stock market Pisces\nHindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were \"nothing but a lie\".\nOn Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.\nShares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.\nIn a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were \"baseless\".\nHindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.\nHowever, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024\nHow Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.\nOf course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\nStory Continues\nBroadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.\nOur View\nWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers\u2014critical components for Nvidia\u2019s AI-focused operations.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nA strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.\nHistorically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s during major market reactions. Nvidia\u2019s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.\nHow To Buy AVGO Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\nStory Continues\nCheck It Out:\nArrived Achieved A Total Return of 34.7% On Their Biggest Sale Yet \u2014 Diversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord.

They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.\"\nNvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock \u2014 up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years \u2014 hit record highs following the election.\nBut many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.\nSemiconductor returns during the second half of 2024\nThe worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.\nMeanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) \u2014 seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor \u2014 is down 14%.\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous.\n\u2022 USD\n(^SOX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTo be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday.\n\"Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],\" said Essaye.\nSince the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia \u2014 \"priced to perfection\" according to many analysts \u2014 underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.\nStory Continues\nBut Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this \"bellwether\" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.\n\"They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far,\" he said. \"I think they can do it again.\"\nmorning brief image\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

          "summary": "While Nvidia (NVDA) continues dominating the AI chip market, investors seek additional opportunities in the rapidly evolving sector. Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations. Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry. Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options. Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: \"It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software \u2014 and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief\u00a0here.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.\nWhen it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there\u2019s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University\u2019s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).\nFounded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university\u2019s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard\u2019s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard\u2019s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university\u2019s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard\u2019s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.\nAccording to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. \u201cNarv\u201d Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia\u2019s 11.5% or Brown\u2019s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC\u2019s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:\n\u201cIn FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC\u2019s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.\u201d\nNotably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from \"overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500.\" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar\u2019s strategy of overhauling the university\u2019s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Harvard Management Company\u2019s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nHarvard Management Company's Stake: $89.6 million\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the world\u2019s largest technology companies, with operations spanning the hardware and software sectors. The company\u2019s primary strength is in hardware, as it supplies networking and custom chips across diverse applications.\nIn its third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and robust non-AI semiconductor sales. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI revenue to grow 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the annual AI revenue to $12 billion, largely fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.\nOn November 6, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company\u2019s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing \u201cseasonal headwinds\u201d linked to a product transition for Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.\nOverall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAs the \u201cAI arms race\u201d continues to evolve, countries are increasingly beginning to realize the efforts they need to expend to stay relevant. One such country in the picture that\u2019s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Updates You Can\u2019t Miss This Weekend and Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight\nThe remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do \"everything they can to lock their digital doors\" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\"While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it\".\nMcFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.\nIn other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.\nThe search, which started on November 1st\u00a0took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it \u201ccannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs\u2019 copied articles were used to build [OpenAI\u2019s] models\u201d.\nStory Continues\n\u201cNews plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week\u2019s worth of its experts\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today\u201d.\nOpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.\nOn November 25, Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and a $1,150.00 price target. Key factors noted during a recent investor meeting have led to this buy rating. A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities. Another factor adding to the positive outlook is the disciplined approach to Pro Plus (the company's new generative AI SKU) pricing. The pressure on the Subscription Gross Margin in the coming year has already been factored into the analysis.\nOverall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nWhat's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?\nServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nCan we expect growth from ServiceNow?\nNYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nIf you'd like to know more about ServiceNow as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

While many are still bullish on further upside in the stock, we believe it's time to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the profits.\nServiceNow specializes in digital workflow automation, providing cloud-based workflow automation solutions that help organizations improve their operations. Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.\nThe company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.\nHard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage\nThe rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.\nApproximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.\nSome of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.\nOur bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft\u2019s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.\nCarahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn\u2019t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company\u2019s future relations with the government.\nIn a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.\nThis also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn\u2019t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock\u2019s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk?

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:\n14% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\nTo start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.\nNYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\nStory Continues\nIs ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nCramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:\n\u201cLet's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive\u2026 Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market\u2026 Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting\u2026 Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again\u2026 Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company\u2019s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.\nOverall NOW ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing \u201csovereign\u201d artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to \u201ccodify\u201d a country\u2019s culture, history, and collective intelligence.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News You Must Read Today.\nThat said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.\u201d\nWhile AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.\nLatest Advancements in AI\nIn recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification\u201d.\nStory Continues\nOther fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.\nIn other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed \u201cOperator\u201d, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human\u2019s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nHow ServiceNow Inc (NOW)\u2019s AI Partnerships Are Driving Its Soaring Growth: Insights from Jim Cramer\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia\u2019s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.\nThis partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.\nFor the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%. The company also expects a gross profit margin of 84.5% for its subscription services, with an operating income margin of 29.5% and a free cash flow margin of 31%.\nOverall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nToast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.\nThe stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock\u2019s ongoing upward momentum.\nAbout the Company\nToast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.\nWith its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.\nIts platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.\nToast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of \u201cA\u201d in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a \u201cF\u201d in Value.\nQ3 Earnings Beat\nOn November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.\nQ3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.\nThe company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.\nGross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.\nManagement comments were overwhelmingly bullish:\n\u201cToast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.\u201d\nEstimates Headed Higher\nAnalysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.\nStory Continues\nFor the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.\nFor the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.\nFor the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.\nToast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote\nWith the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.\nJPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.\nThe Technical Take\nThe stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO\u2019d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.\nAfter trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.\nWith the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.\nPost earnings low: $36\nGap fill: $33\n21-day: $32\n50-day: $29.20\n200-day: $25.20\nFibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32\nWhile that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.\nIn Summary\nToast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.\nThe company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.\nAs Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.\nBear of the Day:\nClean Harbors \u00a0is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.\nThe company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?\nWith an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.\nAbout the Company\nClean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).\nThe company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world\u2019s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.\nCLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cD\u201d in Value, But \u201cB\u201d in both Momentum and Growth.\nQ3 Earnings\nThe company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.\nDespite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.\nPositive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.\nWhile there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.\nEarnings Estimates\nEstimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.\nFor the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.\nLooking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.\nFor the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year\u2019s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.\nTechnical Take\nThe drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.\nThis volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.\nThe drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.\nThe stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.\nIn Summary\nClean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.\nWith significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.\nAdditional content:\nServiceNow Expands Generative AI Offerings: Is the Stock a Buy?\nServiceNow\u00a0is adding Generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to the Now platform to foster responsible AI. NOW is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio, including new, expanded Now Assist capabilities with an AI Governance feature for secure and compliant AI practices.\nNOW\u2019s expanding GenAI portfolio and rich partner base have been driving top-line growth. A strong partner base, which includes the likes of Microsoft , NVIDIA and many more, is strengthening ServiceNow\u2019s AI capabilities.\nNOW and Five9 recently signed an expanded partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified end-to-end employee and customer experiences by combining ServiceNow Customer Service Management and the Five9 platform.\nNOW\u2019s prospects remain bright, with shares appreciating 48% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers \u2013 IT Services industry\u2019s returns of 30% and 15.8%, respectively.\nServiceNow shares are trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\nLet us dig deeper to find out the factors driving NOW\u2019s prospects.\nServiceNow Raises Subscription Revenue Guidance\nFor 2024, NOW expects subscription revenues of $10.655-$10.66 billion (up from previous guidance of $10.575-$10.585 billion), which suggests a rise of 23% from the 2023 actuals on a GAAP basis and 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects the non-GAAP subscription gross margin to be 84.5% and the non-GAAP operating margin to be 29.5%. The free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, subscription revenues are projected between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 21.5-22% on a GAAP basis. At cc, subscription revenues are expected to grow at 20.5%.\nCurrent Remaining Performance Obligation is expected to grow 21.5% year over year on both non-GAAP and GAAP basis.\nServiceNow expects a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% for the current quarter.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $13.87 per share, up 0.4% over the past 30 days, indicating a 28.66% year-over-year increase.\nServiceNow, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ServiceNow, Inc. Quote\nThe consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.\nStrong Portfolio Aids NOW\u2019s Prospects\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.\nServiceNow\u2019s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.\nThe Xanadu update adds the latest AI capabilities to boost customer agility, enhance productivity and improve employee experiences. It expands the GenAI portfolio to enterprise functions, including Security, and Sourcing & Procurement Operations.\nNOW plans to integrate Agentic AI into the ServiceNow platform and unlock 24/7 productivity at a massive scale. This service will be available this November for Customer Service Management AI Agents and IT Service Management AI Agents. It is expected to reduce the time to resolve an issue and make live agents more productive.\nStrong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive\nA strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nNOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.\nThe strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.\nIn third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.\nNOW\u2019s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation\nHowever, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector\u2019s 6.37X.\nWe believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow\u2019s premium valuation.\nConclusion\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.\nServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.\nPaul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell: Overtime\u2019 to discuss the market\u2019s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we\u2019ve had some \"very good\" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and\u00a015 AI News That Broke The Internet\nHickey\u2019s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.\nDevelopments in the AI Landscape\nWith AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the \u201cFuture 40\u201d. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.\nArtificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official \u201cblueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure\u201d, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China\u2019s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act \u201cas ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.\u201d\nStory Continues\nAs per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments \u201cto give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure\u201d, amongst other things.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc.
