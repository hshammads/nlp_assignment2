In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nDan Niles Bullish on Meta Platforms (META) After Earnings, Says Guidance Was Conservative\nTwin Design / Shutterstock.com\nMeta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 235\nDan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, discussed Meta earnings in a program on CNBC and said the stock remains among his favorites for the rest of this year.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMeta came out, had solid results, but they always guide conservatively in the September quarter for the outlook, and the stock sold off, which is what we expected it to do.\u201d\nDespite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\nAccording to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta\u2019s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks 3rd on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

This showdown is about more than just old acquisitionsit's a battle over whether antitrust laws can keep up with the breakneck speed of today's tech landscape.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nJudge James Boasberg isn't making it easy for the FTC, though. While he's allowing the trial to move forward, he's already flagged serious challenges with their case. Meta's defense? The market has changed. Rivals like TikTok, YouTube of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and LinkedIn of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are thriving, so calling them a monopoly feels like reaching. But the FTC isn't backing down, arguing Meta's dominance in personal social networks didn't happen by chanceit happened by design.\nFor investors, this trial is the ultimate watch-and-wait game. If the FTC scores a win, it could shake up how Big Tech does business, especially when it comes to mergers and acquisitions. But if Meta prevails, it might reinforce the company's grip on the digital ecosystem and set a new benchmark for how far regulators can push antitrust cases. Either way, April 2025 isn't just a court dateit's a moment that could reshape the rules of the tech game for years to come.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Several hyperscalers have launched their own LLMs and chatbots in the past few months. Any updates related to these chatbots are followed eagerly by analysts. Anthropic, an AI startup that developed the Claude AI model, recently proposed a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the data that powers them. The startup claims that the system, called the Model Context Protocol, which is open source, would help AI models produce better and more relevant responses to queries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nIn a blog post, the AI startup underlined that as AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. However, the post added, even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data \u2014 trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Anthropic claims that MCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Over a billion people use Messenger monthly.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered impressive third-quarter results on October 30, 2024. The company reported $6.03 earnings per share and $40.5 billion in revenue for Q3 2024, exceeding analyst expectations of $5.22 earnings per share and $40.2 billion in revenue. The growth came as the company attracted more advertising budgets. Increased investment in artificial intelligence to enhance user experience in apps, and enhance engagement levels should allow the company to continue attracting more advertising campaigns.\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 235 hedge funds held Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) at the end of the third quarter, up from 219 in the previous quarter.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of stocks in David Abrams' portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million ($32 million) for systemic breaches.\nThe opposition Liberal party is expected to support the bill though some independent lawmakers have accused the government of rushing through the entire process in around a week.\nA Senate committee responsible for communications legislation is scheduled to deliver a report on Tuesday.\nBytedance's TikTok said the bill lacked clarity and that it had \"significant concerns\" with the government's plan to pass the bill without detailed consultation with experts, social media platforms, mental health organisations and young people.\n\"Where novel policy is put forward, it's important that legislation is drafted in a thorough and considered way, to ensure it is able to achieve its stated intention. This has not been the case with respect to this Bill,\" TikTok said.\nElon Musk's X raised concerns that the bill will negatively impact the human rights of children and young people, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information.\nThe U.S. billionaire, who views himself as a champion of free speech, last week attacked the Australian government saying the bill seemed like a backdoor way to control access to the internet.\nStory Continues\n($1 = 1.5454 Australian dollars)\n(Reporting by Renju Jose in Sydney; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)"

        "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMeta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

That said, newer AI PCs such as Copilot+ PCs from Qualcomm along with Intel and AMD's equivalent chips as well as Apple's expected M4-based Macs are expected to drive the premium segment in coming months.\"\nWhere HP surprised favorably for the first time in a while was its printing business.\nPrinting sales rose 1% from the prior year and came in ahead of expectations. The upside could stem from struggles at rival Xerox (XRX), which is smack in the middle of deep restructuring that pros say is causing market share loss.\n\"On print, results from peers such as Xerox came in below expectations, with Xerox's printing equipment sales declining double-digits year over year due in part to an increase in competitive activity in certain markets,\" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a client note.\nLores said HP is \"gaining share\" in the printing business, though declined to call out Xerox and cautioned the industry remains volatile.\n\"We think that the overall print market in 2025 will slightly decline.

We could not do what we do without them.\"\nApple manufactures most of its iPhones through Foxconn in China, and China is its second-largest consumer market.\nThe uncertainty that follows Trump's diplomacy-by-social-media tactic also has investors cautioning about overreacting to this or any development around trade and tariffs before any policy or proposal is finalized.\n\"Our view remains that tariffs will eventually not end up as bad as feared, but we will see increased uncertainty over the coming months,\" Jefferies analyst Mohit Kumar wrote in a note to investors Tuesday.\n\"Tariffs will further support the view of US over rest of the world from an investment perspective,\" Kumar wrote, suggesting these duties may offer an opportunity for investors.\nCapital Economics' Brown added that, \"Given the likelihood that these types of threats will be commonplace for the next four years, there is a risk of overinterpreting them.\"\nStill, the speed with which Trump appears to be putting plans in place signals the incoming president is looking to \"move much more quickly with tariffs than during his first term.\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "whole_article": "Huawei Technologies launched its flagship Mate 70 smartphone models, introducing its new HarmonyOS NEXT operating system amid growing fears of U.S. export restrictions on Chinese chipmakers.\nThe Mate 70 Pro costs 6,499 yuan ($896); the Mate 70 range begins at 5,499 yuan ($759). The Mate 70 Pro+ runs at 8,499 yuan ($1,172). Apple (AAPL, Financials) offers its basic iPhone 16 model in China for 5, 999 yuan ($826), by contrast.\nHuawei started gathering Mate 70 series pre-orders last week. The phones include an AI-capable interface with real-time translation and voice restoration tools and enable Tiantong satellite calls featuring a new satellite paging capability.\nDesigned as part of Huawei's attempt to cut reliance on American technology, the Mate 70 represents the first significant release of HarmonyOS NEXT, the Android-free operating system built by the firm.\nWith an aim of reaching 100,000 apps in the next months, the business also revealed it secured over 15,000 applications for its HarmonyOS ecosystem.\nConcerns about the U.S. government possibly imposing additional export restrictions, which may put up to 200 Chinese semiconductor firms to a trade blacklist, therefore restricting access to American suppliers, accompany the launch.\nLaunched immediately after Apple's release of the iPhone 16 series on Sept. 9, Huawei claimed in September receiving over 3 million pre-orders for its triple-folding Mate XT smartphone on its Vmall website. Surprising many observers with its purported 5G capabilities despite U.S. prohibitions on essential technologies, the Mate 70 replaces the Mate 60 series, which was introduced secretly in August of last year.\nOnce a major rival of Apple and Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, Financials) in the worldwide mobile industry, U.S. regulations starting in 2019 limited Huawei's access to chipmaking equipment for sophisticated smartphone models, therefore posing serious obstacles to once major rival.\nHuawei unveiled the Pura 70 series in April, including the Kirin 9010 chipa follow-up to the Kirin 9000s allegedly manufactured by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMICY, Financials)reportedly for the Mate 60 Pro.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The stock's recent underperformance notwithstanding, the Zacks analyst remains optimistic about Apple's long-term outlook on the back of strong growth in Services revenues, an expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade and introduction of Apple Intelligence have helped and are going to help the company grow.\nHowever, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a major headwind.\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\nMeta\u00a0shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+68.8% vs. +45.3%), reflecting steady user growth globally.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAs the \u201cAI arms race\u201d continues to evolve, countries are increasingly beginning to realize the efforts they need to expend to stay relevant. One such country in the picture that\u2019s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI News Updates You Can\u2019t Miss This Weekend and Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight\nThe remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do \"everything they can to lock their digital doors\" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\"While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it\".\nMcFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.\nIn other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.\nThe search, which started on November 1st\u00a0took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it \u201ccannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs\u2019 copied articles were used to build [OpenAI\u2019s] models\u201d.\nStory Continues\n\u201cNews plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week\u2019s worth of its experts\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today\u201d.\nOpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nApple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational corporation and technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide. Apple Intelligence is the company\u2019s personal intelligence system.\nOn November 22, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc.

        "whole_article": "Huawei Technologies kept a lid on what, if any, chip advancements sit inside its Mate 70 series smartphones during a launch event on Tuesday, as the tech giant looks to take a bigger bite out of Apple's market share in China.\nRichard Yu Chengdong, chairman of Huawei's consumer business group, took the stage in Shenzhen to unveil the Mate 70 and three more premium handsets in the same line, with a starting price of 5,499 yuan (US$760). He called the new series \"the most powerful Mate phones in history\", without mentioning any details about the processor that powers them.\nInstead, Yu highlighted the HarmonyOS Next operating system, which the company says offers 40 per cent better performance on the latest smartphones over the Mate 60 series. HarmonyOS Next is Huawei's home-grown mobile operating system that has diverged from Android to the point of no longer being compatible with those apps.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nHuawei also touted its latest artificial intelligence (AI) features, such as photo enhancement and hand gestures, which include the ability to grab and release images for sharing to different devices.\nThe Mate 70 line has been highly anticipated since the launch of the Mate 60 last year marked Huawei's return to China 5G smartphone market. Photo: Weibo/ \u65fa\u4ed4\u767e\u4e8b\u901a alt=The Mate 70 line has been highly anticipated since the launch of the Mate 60 last year marked Huawei's return to China 5G smartphone market. Photo: Weibo/ \u65fa\u4ed4\u767e\u4e8b\u901a>\nThe release of the Mate 70 has been closely watched by the industry looking for any indication that it would be able to advance beyond the China-made processor in last year's Mate 60 devices. That chip was said to have been produced by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) using a 7-nanometre process. US sanctions on Huawei and SMIC have sought to restrict access to such technology.\nThe Mate 60 ignited patriotic fervour at home, helping reverse Huawei's flagging smartphone sales and enabling it to take on Apple and domestic rivals such as Xiaomi. The subsequent Pura 70 series handsets, which reportedly run on chips produced with the same 7nm process, helped put the firm back among the top Chinese Android brands.\nShipments of Mate 70 series handsets are expected to exceed 10 million units throughout its life cycle, according to Counterpoint Research, making it another important flagship product for Huawei.\nStory Continues\nWhen pre-orders opened on Huawei's online store on November 18, more than 3.2 million people signed up prior to the official release. Signing up did not require a deposit.\nHuawei's global sales in the first three quarters of 2024 grew 51 per cent compared with the same period last year, with 90 per cent coming from mainland China, according to Counterpoint.\n\"With no support for Android apps, Huawei can optimise HarmonyOS by focusing 100 per cent of its efforts on maximising the performance of its self-developed Kirin chips, providing a consistent user experience, and accelerating the integration of on-device and cloud AI systems, similar to what Apple has done with iOS,\" Counterpoint analysts Mengmeng Zhang and Archie Zhang said on Tuesday.\nStill, it will take time for Huawei to expand its developer community and build a competitive ecosystem for the OS, they added.\nThe Mate 70 series stands to further strengthen Huawei's position in the world's largest smartphone market, as it looks to reclaim ground it lost after Washington first sanctioned the firm in 2019. Huawei briefly surpassed Samsung Electronics and Apple in global smartphone shipments before the bite of US sanctions all but crippled its handset business.\nHuawei's third-quarter smartphone shipments on the mainland rose 42 per cent year on year to take 15.3 per cent of the market, behind market leader Vivo and second-ranked Apple, according to an IDC report last month.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "whole_article": "Google has a lot at stake if the Justice Department succeeds in breaking up its empire, from control over its search data and Android operating system to the loss of its Chrome browser.\nBut the biggest threat the company faces is to a search business that is deeply woven into the technology ecosystem of its parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\nOf the $307.3 billion in revenue Google made in 2023, $175 billion came solely from that ad-driven search engine business. The DOJ wants to impose dozens of limitations on the way that Google connects that engine with consumers.\nOther parts of Alphabet could also be affected. The DOJ also asked for the company to be prohibited from favoring its video subsidiary, YouTube, which is part of its YouTube Ads business unit.\nThat unit, which generated $31.3 billion in revenue in 2023, earns money through ads that appear on and around YouTube videos. Google search promotes YouTube video links in response user queries.\nGoogle's digital ads business, a division that generated $31.5 billion in revenue in 2023, could also be imperiled by a limitation on search favoring YouTube. Advertisers as well as content creators use Google's buyer- and seller-side platforms to target consumers and monetize video content.\nIt will be up to District of Columbia Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ\u2019s monopoly argument in a trial that wrapped up earlier this year, to approve any of the proposals submitted by prosecutors. That could include the sale of Google's Chrome browser and a divestment of its Android mobile operating system.\nEven artificial-intelligence investments designed to pay off in the future could be under threat. Prosecutors also called for Google to divest within six months any investment or ownership in rival query-based AI products, as well as rival search text advertising technology products.\nThat would force Google to unwind its partnership with generative AI startup Anthropic. Google has invested $2 billion in Anthropic, while also hiring the founders of another AI startup, Character.AI.\nTaken together, the Justice Department\u2019s requests would dramatically alter the tech landscape. Some legal experts said there is a slim chance Mehta will grant all of the prosecutors' proposals.\nJudge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, will decide whether Google gets broken up. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mark Wilson via Getty Images\n\"I think it's pretty unlikely that the government will be successful in getting these things,\" Columbia Law School antitrust professor Erik Hovenkamp told Yahoo Finance.\n\"In particular, I do not expect the court to order any divestiture. Contrary to popular misconception, antitrust rarely breaks up monopolies.\"\nStory Continues\nThe $20 billion threat to Apple\nThe remedy legal experts say is most likely to be granted is a request to prohibit Google from agreements that secure its search engine as the default in browsers and on mobile devices.\nThat could hurt Google partners more than Google itself.\nOne is Apple (APPL). In 2022, Google paid Apple roughly $20 billion for default placement of Google Search on Apple\u2019s Safari browser and to power search access points like the Siri voice assistant.\n\"Google would not have to pay $20 billion anymore, so they would gain market cap,\" said Jean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine rival Brave. \"And that would be super perverted, because suddenly the perpetrator is being compensated.\"\nCash from Google\u2019s payments falls under Apple\u2019s services segment, which brought in some $78.1 billion in 2022. Eliminating Google\u2019s payments would effectively cut 25% of the services segment\u2019s revenue from that year.\nCEO of Apple, Tim Cook, on Apple's campus in Cupertino, Calif., in September. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nSchmetz hypothesized that if Google\u2019s default contracts are prohibited, and no money flows between browsers and its search engines, Apple would stand to lose $500 billion in market cap, and Google would gain $500 billion.\n\"There would be $23 billion times the multiple of Apple that would just basically stop existing,\" Schmetz said.\nAnother roughly $6 billion flows from Google to a group of browsers, mobile device manufacturers and wireless service providers, including Mozilla, Samsung, Sony, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.\n'A fool's errand'\nSome experts have doubts the DOJ\u2019s plans will effectively open up the markets for search and mobile.\nInstead of dismantling Google, the Justice Department should force Google and Big Tech cohorts to be more open and interoperable, said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab and a research scientist at the MIT Sloan School.\n\"I think it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand,\" Catalini told Yahoo Finance.\nIf the DOJ's remedies are denied \"then it\u2019s all for nothing\" but if they are accepted the remedies are probably worse than the underlying issue,\" he added. \"And ironically, there's a lot more that could be done to restore competition in all of these sectors through much simpler measures.\u201d\nThose measures, he said, could include making it easier for third parties to offer their own payment services and app stores on mobile devices.\nGoogle Play gift cards are seen in a shop in New York. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\"Imagine forcing multiple stores to have the same level of service in the Google ecosystem on mobile,\" Catalini said.\nGoogle makes money on ad sales through its Play Store, and takes a 13% cut of app store sales. The company\u2019s Android ecosystem also acts as a flywheel for its ad sales by driving users to Google Search and other services.\n\"Allowing for different parties to provide payments rather than just the Google payment flow in its app stores, or interpretability in messaging and in the services that platforms like Apple and Google dominate today. I think that would go much [further] in terms of really giving\u2026businesses an opportunity to compete.\"\nAnother of the DOJ's proposals is to force Google to sell its internet index at a \"marginal cost\" and to make its search results, ranking signals, and query understanding available to rivals for purchase for 10 years.\nThe proposition is a risky one, according to Schmetz, because if Google is required to make its proprietary search data available it could wipe out Brave Search API and Bing Search API \u2014 the two other US search providers that crawl and index the internet. APIs or application programming interfaces provide search results to other search engines.\n\"Google's price cannot be just the marginal price of providing an API - which is basically zero,\" he said, \"since it would destroy other existing businesses that are thriving.\"\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai. REUTERS/Jim Young \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nThere\u2019s no guarantee Mehta will agree to move forward with all or even some of the DOJ\u2019s proposed remedies. And Google has said it will appeal the initial antitrust decision.\nFor now, the company has to wait and see how Mehta rules on the penalties, which is expected to happen after a remedies trial scheduled to take place in 2025.\nGoogle also faces another antitrust trial that could end with restrictions on its separate ad tech business, if the Justice Department has its way.\nProsecutors who brought that case during President Biden's administration have already asked for a judge to force Google to divest Google Ad Manager suite, including its publisher-side ad server, DFP, and its ad exchange, AdX.\nClosing arguments in that case occurred Monday and a judge is expected to rule before year end.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

The upside surprise came from the value-focused Hollister division \u2014 a business that is only now turning the corner amid new product introductions such as college-themed apparel.\n\u201cHollister is back,\u201d Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Fran Horowitz told Yahoo Finance.\nAbercrombie & Fitch stock fell about 5% on Tuesday as sales results at the Abercrombie division only matched elevated analyst estimates.\n\u2022 USD\n(ANF)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nStill, Citi analyst Paul Lejuez called the quarter \"strong\" in a note to clients.\nThe Street may also have been concerned that the company's inventory growth outpaced sales growth going into a holiday shopping season where consumers continue to spend cautiously.\nHorowitz said the holiday season has started \"strong.\"\nFresh potential tariffs on China that President-elect Trump floated late Monday also appeared to be weighing on investor sentiment. Abercrombie operates stores in China and sources apparel from the country.\nTrump proposed an additional 10% tariff on all products from China, contending the country was shipping illegal drugs to the US.\nCEOs such as Brooks Running' Dan Sheridan said tariffs could hammer the apparel industry on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

However, markets have bounced back, hinting at yet another rally ahead of the all-important holiday season.\nAlso, the fourth quarter has historically been great for stocks. This is likely to help Dow continue its northward journey. Given the positive sentiment, investors should bet on these three fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and The Walt Disney Company DIS.\nThese companies are strategically positioned to take advantage of the overall upward trend in the market and assure good returns.\nDow Closes at Record High\nOn Monday, the Dow jumped 1% or 440.06 points to close at an all-time high of 44,736.57 points. This was the blue-chip index\u2019s 45th record close this year.\nAlthough tech stocks have been primarily responsible for the broader rally, investors have lately been shifting focus to more economically sensitive corners of the market after the election. This has seen industrial and utility stocks gaining big, helping both the Dow and the S&P 500.\nMonday\u2019s jump came as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who is being seen as someone who would guide the economy into greener pastures without sparking inflation. Investors are hopeful about major reforms under Trump\u2019s regime, including major tax cuts.\nDow Rally to Continue\nThe Dow rally gathered pace on Nov. 6, the day Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. The blue-chip index added over 1,500 points to record its biggest single-day gain since November 2022 and the biggest post-election surge in 128 years.\nFollowing Trump's win, investors are expecting lower taxes and fewer regulations, as they see the new president as someone who openly addresses issues like the stock market and the value of the dollar.\nAlso, investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will continue with its rate cuts, given that inflation is slowing and nearing its 2% goal. Since September, the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates by a total of 75 basis points, taking its benchmark policy rate to a range of 4.5-4.75%.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank need not be \u201cin a hurry\u201d to cut rates given the strength in the economy. However, market participants are still hopeful about another rate cut in December. Markets are pricing in a 56.2% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut by the Fed in its December policy meeting.\nStory Continues\n3 Dow Stocks With Upside\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN\u2019s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well supported by its massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish a footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 79% for the current year.

        "whole_article": "Back in 2001, Amazon was in serious trouble. The dot-com bubble had burst and Amazon's stock had tanked by 90%.\nMany thought it wouldn't survive. But Jeff Bezos found inspiration in an unexpected place: a coffee meeting with Jim Sinegal, the founder of Costco. According to Brad Stone\u2019s 2013 book The Everything Store, they met at a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble near Amazon's Bellevue headquarters.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nSinegal wasn't there to offer a magic fix \u2013 he simply explained Costco's secret sauce. The key? Value. Costco kept prices incredibly low by cutting unnecessary costs, sticking to a strict 15% markup and treating suppliers fairly to secure great deals.\nSinegal told Bezos, \"The membership fee is a one-time pain, but it's reinforced every time customers walk in and see forty-seven-inch televisions that are two hundred dollars less than anyplace else.\u201d That trust kept customers returning, knowing they'd always find great deals.\nBezos took this advice seriously. Days after the meeting, he called a team meeting at Amazon to discuss the company's pricing strategy \u2013 or lack thereof.\nSee Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nThe goal? Make Amazon synonymous with lower prices. According to The New York Times, Bezos famously said, \"There are two kinds of companies: those that raise prices and those that work to lower them. We are going to be the second, full-stop.\"\nSoon after, Amazon slashed prices on books, music and videos \u2013 its flagship products \u2013 by as much as 30%. It worked. By the end of 2001, Amazon posted its first profitable quarter. \"We had a great Q4,\" Bezos told Fox News in January 2002. \"What really drove it was lower prices for customers.\"\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\nThe Costco connection didn't stop there. Inspired by Costco's membership model, Amazon launched Prime in 2005. It wasn't just about free shipping but creating compelling value that customers couldn't resist.\nStory Continues\nBezos described Prime in a 2016 shareholder letter: \u201cWe want Prime to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member.\" Today, Prime has over 200 million members worldwide, generating more than $35 billion annually.\nCostco's influence is evident not just in pricing but in Amazon's overall ethos. Take Costco's $1.50 hot dog combo, for instance \u2013 it's stayed the same price for decades. According to former Costco CEO Craig Jelinek, Sinegal once joked, \"If you raise the [hot dog] price, I will kill you.\u201d Similarly, Amazon reinvests heavily in its logistics and technology to keep costs low and deliver on its customer-first promise.\nRead Next:\n\u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "whole_article": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Amazon (AMZN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AMZN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nAmazon's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Amazon's main business drivers.\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\n\nIts online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company\u2019s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish footprint in physical grocery supermarket space.\nAmazon also enjoys dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin generating businesses.\nAmazon has also become a household name with its Alexa powered Echo devices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa is helping the company sell products and services.\nRevenues were $574.8 billion in 2023. The company reports revenue under three broad heads\u2014North America, International and AWS, which generated 61.4%, 22.8% and 15.8% of total revenues, respectively.\nHeadquartered in Seattle, WA, Amazon targets three categories of customers\u2014consumers, sellers and website developers. Consumers are offered variety, convenience and free delivery of goods displayed on the company\u2019s websites.\n\nThe agreements with sellers are varied, enabling them to use the company\u2019s websites to either sell their merchandise directly, or redirect customers to the sellers\u2019 own branded websites. In case of the latter arrangement, Amazon earns a fee for the sales thus generated.\nCompetition comes in the form of traditional retailers, other online retailers, media companies, web portals, search engines, e-commerce companies and cloud computing service providers.\nBottom Line\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Amazon ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nStory Continues\nA $1000 investment made in November 2014 would be worth $12,025.43, or a 1,102.54% gain, as of November 26, 2024, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 189.66% and gold's return of 110.14% over the same time frame.\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for AMZN too.\nAmazon\u2019s third-quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. We expect 2024 net sales to increase 10.7% from 2023. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon\u2019s expanding global presence remains a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. The company issued positive Q4 2024 guidance fueling investor enthusiasm. However, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\nThe stock has jumped 6.93% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 16 higher, for fiscal 2024; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "whole_article": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - Netflix won the dismissal on Tuesday of a shareholder lawsuit accusing the streaming company of downplaying the impact on subscriber growth of account sharing, where paying members share user names and passwords with nonpaying members in other households.\nThe proposed class action led by a Texas-based trustee began after Netflix revealed in April 2022 it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the prior quarter, the first decline in a decade, and might lose 2 million more in the next three months.\nNetflix blamed the decline on several factors, including account sharing, rising competition and a shutdown of service in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Its shares fell 35% the next day, wiping out more than $54 billion of market value.\nU.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in Oakland, California, however, said Netflix's earlier claims to be \"roughly 60% penetrated\" in the United States and Canada with \"a lot of headroom\" to grow were not false or misleading, because they referred to paid subscribers and did not imply that growth was certain.\nHe also found no proof Netflix concealed any determination that account sharing would severely hinder growth.\n\"At most,\" he said, the plaintiff's allegations suggest that the Los Gatos, California-based company investigated account sharing and found it to be \"one potential threat to growth among many.\"\nLawyers for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Netflix and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.\nTigar had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit in January. Tuesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, the trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, cannot amend his complaint again.\nThe case is Pirani v Netflix Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-02672. (This story has been refiled to change the location of the judge to Oakland, California, from San Francisco, in paragraph 4)\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

        "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "whole_article": "Netflix stock (NFLX) closed at a fresh record every day this past week, with shares securing their biggest weekly gain since January \u2014 and they could keep soaring.\nA growing number of analysts are calling for the streaming giant's shares to soon trade in the quadruple digits.\nOn Wednesday, Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak raised his price target on Netflix to a Street high of $1,100 a share, implying over 20% upside based on current trading levels of around $900.\nBank of America's Jessica Reif Ehrlich followed one day later, boosting her target to $1,000 from $800. Jefferies analyst James Heaney also raised his target to $1,000 earlier this week.\nThe price target increases come despite some concerns over slowing growth for the streaming giant.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nWall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $800 a share, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.\nOne of the main catalysts for the recent price target boosts is the company's continued foray into live events, with the most recent boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson attracting over 108 million global viewers last weekend to become the most-streamed sporting event of all time.\nFor context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers.\nThe Netflix event's impressive numbers came despite the streamer experiencing several technical glitches throughout the broadcast, which analysts (and investors) mostly shrugged off.\n\"We view the event as a (very) successful learning experience for NFLX and expect these technical issues will not happen again with future live events,\" Pivotal Research's Wlodarczak wrote on Wednesday.\nThe analyst said the event's success likely means Netflix will \"accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming,\" which will help lower subscriber churn and increase the streamer's ability to raise prices.\n\"The NFLX service remains a highly compelling, frankly relatively inexpensive, entertainment alternative for consumers, which bodes well for future subscriber/average revenue per user growth,\" he said.\nNetflix's 'complementary growth drivers'\nKatie Taylor, Mike Tyson, Ariel Helwani, Jake Paul, and Amanda Serrano speak onstage at the press conference in promotion for the upcoming Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match at The Apollo Theater on May 13, 2024, in New York City. (Sarah Stier/Getty Images for Netflix) \u00b7 Sarah Stier via Getty Images\nSince the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged roughly 85%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.\nStory Continues\nLast week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.\nNetflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyonc\u00e9 will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.\nThe company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nJefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a \"breakthrough\" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.\nBofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, \"Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.\"\nNetflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.\nStill, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat \u2014 a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.\n\"With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.\nValuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock \"is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025.\" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "whole_article": "By Caroline Valetkevitch\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Netflix shares were on track for a fifth consecutive gain on Friday and set for their biggest weekly percentage rise since January, after the streaming media company's popular boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul.\nThe stock was last up 0.2% at $899.06, off its intraday record high of $908 on Thursday.

These companies have millions of digital customers\u2014and billions of interactions with them. They are using the insights from this data to rapidly optimize each customer\u2019s next experience.\nIn the age of artificial intelligence, competitive advantage is increasingly determined by a company's ability to deliver personalized experiences at scale. We call this phenomenon the \u201cpersonalization advantage,\u201d which can be expressed by a simple formula:\nP = n \u00d7 v2\nP represents the competitive advantage of personalization.\nN is the volume of interactions from which the company can learn.\nV is the speed of learning, which has an exponential impact.\nThe Personalization Advantage formula illustrates why these companies are winning: they have both scale (n) in terms of customer interactions and speed (v) in learning from and acting on these interactions.\nPersonalization is not just customization\u2014it\u2019s about using customer data to deliver experiences tailored in real-time, evolving with each interaction. Whether it's a website suggesting products you didn't know you needed based on prior behavior, a call center agent knowing your shopping history with the company, or a sales associate remembering your preferences, the key is scaling these interactions across millions of customers and constantly learning from them.\nPersonalization is creating experiences at scale that get fine-tuned with each successive interaction, empowering customers to get what they want better, faster, cheaper, or more easily. The difference lies in the way personalized communications build on everything the company learns about the customer over time, and about how other customers like them behave. In our experience across industries and consumer contexts, this is what makes personalization truly effective. This effectiveness is directly linked to the Personalization Advantage formula. The more interactions a company has (n), and the faster it can learn from them (v), the greater its personalization advantage (P) becomes.\nIt is enabled by the many different forms of AI available: machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and others, often combined together. Business is now effectively at the point where competitive advantage will be based on a company\u2019s ability to relentlessly capture, analyze, and utilize customer data, at a massive scale, with every possible contact\u2014and on how it uses that data to understand, shape, personalize, and optimize each customer\u2019s journey.\nStory Continues\nBuilding economies of scale has always been important in business, especially in the physical aspects of competition: supply chains, production, and distribution. However, personalization changes the nature of scale in the customer experience from the mass production of goods to the mass delivery of 1:1 experiences built on accumulated intelligence. Personalization at scale, and the ongoing cycle of experimentation and learning that power it, create a competitive moat that is very hard to replicate. This competitive moat is precisely what our Personalization Advantage formula quantifies.\nIt\u2019s about scale (n)\nCompanies such as Alipay, Amazon, Tencent, Flipkart, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify have each amassed over 200 million active users. The sheer size of their digital customer base is enormous. They distill insights about these users not just when they transact, but every time they browse or click in a digital channel. But even non-digital native companies are maximizing the \u201csurface area\u201d they have for gathering and using customer information\u2014like an alarm company understanding how homeowners use their touchpads or B2B distributors tracking the frequency and nature of replenishment orders.\nThese companies even know the lifetime value of each new active user they add\u2014and invest accordingly. For example, a large food and beverage company we\u2019ve worked with estimated that each 10 million new digital customer relationships would add $1 billion in incremental revenue.\nIt\u2019s about speed (v)\nUltimately, personalization is about what companies do with the insights about their customers. This is where companies are competing on speed. Speed in getting to know the customer throughout the customer journey, speed in executing based on a trigger about a customer, and speed in constantly improving the experience based on that knowledge. We are big believers in the importance of \u201ctime-based competition,\u201d the concept of competing on the basis of speed. In personalization, it is foundational.\nThe squared term in our formula (v2) emphasizes the outsized impact of speed. Doubling the speed of learning and execution more than doubles the personalization advantage.\nIt is no coincidence that companies across a wide swath of categories, including home improvement, banking, restaurants, grocery, and apparel have publicly announced that personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences are central to their corporate strategy. These companies understand that maximizing both (n) and (v) in the Personalization Advantage formula is crucial for their success.\nBy studying hundreds of personalization leaders over the past decade, we have even quantified the size of the personalization advantage pioneering companies are capturing in terms of growth. Across industries, we find that personalization leaders consistently outgrow laggards. In fact, leaders grow top-line revenues 10 points faster per year than laggards. Taken together, we estimate that by the end of this decade, the personalization leaders, on a combined basis, will capture almost $2 trillion in incremental growth.\nThe basis of competition has shifted\u2014and the prize for those that rethink their business model accordingly is enormous. But here\u2019s the catch. Our research also finds that only 10% of companies qualify as personalization leaders. Many businesses say they are doing personalization but fail to go beyond basic segmented marketing. They end up sending more spam, generating more calls from complaining customers, and frustrating themselves with slower growth than expected. These laggards are failing to optimize both (n) and (v) in the personalization advantage formula, limiting their growth potential.\nMore must-read\u00a0commentary\u00a0published by\u00a0Fortune:\nShell\u2019s Pyrrhic victory may well set the stage for more corporate climate accountability\nDemis Hassabis-James Manyika: AI will help us understand the very fabric of reality\nI worked with Steve Jobs.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 286\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Latest reports, published by news publication Bloomberg, suggest that the recent $4 billion investment by the tech titan into AI startup Anthropic is part of a larger plan to make the Neuron SDK, the software used to run AI workloads on the chips, more appealing. Per the report, convincing customers to switch from rival NVIDIA would require hundreds of hours of development time, and Anthropic teams working directly with AWS personnel would help bridge this gap.\nStory Continues\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of AI news updates investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores entering 2025.\n\"Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be,\" Lores told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday (video above).\nThe comments on prices to consumers echo some of those made by Best Buy CEO Corie Barry today on her call with reporters.\nLores said he is looking forward to working with the incoming Trump administration and prefers smooth trading relationships between countries.\n\"We are a global company that does business in many parts of the globe, and that does development in many parts of the globe, and that has manufacturing in many parts of the globe. So for us, an easy way of trading across countries is the preferred option,\" Lores added.\nRead more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them?\nAs tariff convos whipsaw markets, HP released mixed fiscal fourth quarter sales results after the market close.\nSales of consumer PCs fell 4% in the quarter, while commercial sales improved 5%. Operating margins in the PC division fell sharply year over year.\nSimilar to the previous quarter, commercial clients are upgrading their computers ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025.\nConsumer PCs are under slight pressure as people await new AI computer releases and spend more money on experiences.\nWorldwide shipments of traditional PCs in the calendar year third quarter hit 68.8 million, down 2.4% year over year, according to data from IDC. Sales were hurt by rising costs and inventory replenishment in the prior quarter, IDC explained.\nEarnings analysis\nNet sales: $14.1 billion (+1.7% year over year) vs. $13.9 billion estimate\nPersonal systems sales: $9.6 billion (+2% year over year) vs. $9.7 billion estimate\nConsumer personal system sales: -4%\nCommercial personal system sales: +5%\nPrinting sales: $4.5 billion (+1% year over year) vs. $4.2 billion estimate\nConsumer printing sales: +3%\nCommercial printing sales: -1%\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS): $0.93 (+3% year over year) vs. $0.93 estimate (guidance: $0.89-$0.99)\nWhat else caught our attention\nWeak margins: Quarterly operating margins dropped to 8.5% from 9% a year ago\nPersonal systems operating margins fell to 5.7% from 6.7% a year ago\nPrinting operating margins rose to 19.6% from 18.9% a year ago\nFiscal first quarter EPS guidance: $0.70 to $0.76 vs. $0.86 estimate\nFull-year EPS guidance: $3.45 to $3.75 vs. $3.60 estimate\nStory Continues\n\"Demand, without a doubt, has returned for PCs amongst consumers and commercial buyers,\" IDC research manager Jitesh Ubrani said. \"However, much of the demand was still concentrated at the entry-level thanks to a recovering economy and the back-to-school season in North America. That said, newer AI PCs such as Copilot+ PCs from Qualcomm along with Intel and AMD's equivalent chips as well as Apple's expected M4-based Macs are expected to drive the premium segment in coming months.\"\nWhere HP surprised favorably for the first time in a while was its printing business.\nPrinting sales rose 1% from the prior year and came in ahead of expectations. The upside could stem from struggles at rival Xerox (XRX), which is smack in the middle of deep restructuring that pros say is causing market share loss.\n\"On print, results from peers such as Xerox came in below expectations, with Xerox's printing equipment sales declining double-digits year over year due in part to an increase in competitive activity in certain markets,\" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a client note.\nLores said HP is \"gaining share\" in the printing business, though declined to call out Xerox and cautioned the industry remains volatile.\n\"We think that the overall print market in 2025 will slightly decline. The decline will be less than what we saw this year, but our goal continues to be to perform better than the market,\" Lores said.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

However, markets have bounced back, hinting at yet another rally ahead of the all-important holiday season.\nAlso, the fourth quarter has historically been great for stocks. This is likely to help Dow continue its northward journey. Given the positive sentiment, investors should bet on these three fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and The Walt Disney Company DIS.\nThese companies are strategically positioned to take advantage of the overall upward trend in the market and assure good returns.\nDow Closes at Record High\nOn Monday, the Dow jumped 1% or 440.06 points to close at an all-time high of 44,736.57 points. This was the blue-chip index\u2019s 45th record close this year.\nAlthough tech stocks have been primarily responsible for the broader rally, investors have lately been shifting focus to more economically sensitive corners of the market after the election. This has seen industrial and utility stocks gaining big, helping both the Dow and the S&P 500.\nMonday\u2019s jump came as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who is being seen as someone who would guide the economy into greener pastures without sparking inflation. Investors are hopeful about major reforms under Trump\u2019s regime, including major tax cuts.\nDow Rally to Continue\nThe Dow rally gathered pace on Nov. 6, the day Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. The blue-chip index added over 1,500 points to record its biggest single-day gain since November 2022 and the biggest post-election surge in 128 years.\nFollowing Trump's win, investors are expecting lower taxes and fewer regulations, as they see the new president as someone who openly addresses issues like the stock market and the value of the dollar.\nAlso, investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will continue with its rate cuts, given that inflation is slowing and nearing its 2% goal. Since September, the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates by a total of 75 basis points, taking its benchmark policy rate to a range of 4.5-4.75%.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank need not be \u201cin a hurry\u201d to cut rates given the strength in the economy. However, market participants are still hopeful about another rate cut in December. Markets are pricing in a 56.2% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut by the Fed in its December policy meeting.\nStory Continues\n3 Dow Stocks With Upside\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN\u2019s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well supported by its massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish a footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 79% for the current year.

Already a vocal critic of the Chips Act, the President-elect vowed on Monday to impose additional tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Software, in contrast, has been on an upswing. Investors are positive on the group given its lower exposure to tariff risks, and as the tailwind from artificial intelligence looks set to shift from infrastructure to services.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n\u201cSoftware got left behind, but looks to be the next winner from AI, while it could also benefit if the new administration is more lenient on regulation and M&A,\u201d said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Co. On the flip side, \u201cthere\u2019s so much good news in chips, especially AI chips, that the valuation has gotten steep at a time when there\u2019s more uncertainty.\u201d\nRecent earnings reports underline the sentiment shift. Shares in data-analysis software company Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) soared on the back of a robust forecast, while demand for AI software fueled Palantir Technologies Inc.\u2019s blowout report. In contrast, even strong results from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) failed to excite investors.\nSo far in November, a major exchange-traded fund that tracks software is up 16%, putting it on track for its biggest one-month gain in a year, although it was flat on Tuesday. A semiconductor fund, meanwhile, is up less than 2% this month. Flows into the software ETF have also far eclipsed the chip fund, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\u2022 USD\n(SNOW)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe outperformance represents \u201can all-time record move for software vs. semis,\u201d according to Michael Toomey, managing director of equities trading at Jefferies. Still, the shift \u201cbarely makes a mark in the 10-year chart\u201d of their relative performance, suggesting room for the trend to continue, he said.\nThe extent of the rotation will depend on how things play out under Trump. Sean O\u2019Hara, president of Pacer ETF Distributors, sees \u201ca lot of uncertainty for chipmakers around the tariff side of things.\u201d That\u2019s created the potential for volatility, especially because chip stocks have already had a big AI-related rally. \u201cAt the same time, I think we\u2019ll see more focus on AI software,\u201d he said.\nStory Continues\nSo far, the AI theme has benefited chipmakers much more than software firms, with companies pumping money into the chips and servers they need to run the technology. Meanwhile, only a few software companies \u2014 like Palantir, (PLTR) Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) \u2014 have seen meaningful AI-related tailwinds. But software and services may be the next place that sees an inflection in AI growth.\n\u2022 USD\n(CRM)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAt the same time, being the first major beneficiary of the AI trade has left chipmakers looking expensive. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index trades at 24 times estimated earnings, above its 10-year average of 18, with stocks like ARM Holdings Plc and Nvidia among the most expensive. That could mean more downside risk if headwinds emerge, while Nvidia\u2019s report showed that it may take even bigger beats to keep lifting the sector.\n\u2022 USD\n(PLTR)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTo be sure, semiconductor stocks remain a popular place for growth. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, earnings for chip companies are expected to grow 40% in 2025, compared with about 12% for those in the software and services industry. Sales growth is also expected to be much stronger for semiconductor firms.\nThe next big test for software will come in early December, when Salesforce Inc. reports results. The company has been hiring aggressively to push its new generative AI agent product, and strong results from the company will help sustain the sector\u2019s rally, according to Jordan Klein, a tech-sector specialist at Mizuho Securities.\n\u201cPost-election, generalist and tech investors are faced with the struggle of owning much more software (and fintech) and owning a lot less semis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMissing out on these moves leaves some in a bad spot.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nQualcomm Inc.\u2019s interest in pursuing an acquisition of Intel Corp. has cooled, according to people familiar with the matter, upending what would have likely been one of the largest technology deals of all time.\nHuawei Technologies Co. said that from next year its new smartphones and tablets will run on an operating system stripped of Google\u2019s open-source Android technology.\nZoom Video Communications Inc. gave a sales forecast for the current quarter that failed to impress investors who were expecting a bigger boost from the company\u2019s expanded suite of products.\nA federal judge threw cold water on one of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s key arguments in a Department of Justice lawsuit over allegations that Google monopolized advertising technology.\nDonald Trump fired an opening shot in his tariff battle with Beijing by promising an additional 10% levy on Chinese goods.

The study, called The Future Factories was carried out earlier this year in collaboration with design software giant Autodesk. The report warns that the lack of confidence in digital technologies and AI means companies in the UK are at risk of missing out on innovation and productivity gains. It also proposes how government initiatives and regulation can support the adoption of new technologies.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe report further highlights that manufacturers were mostly using AI to manage their energy usage and reduce waste. It added that some of the manufacturing sectors in which AI was being used were predictive maintenance and supply chain optimization. Per a survey cited in the study, the biggest benefits manufacturers cited were increased efficiency, improved productivity, and automation of routine tasks.

President-elect Donald Trump expressed skepticism about a Google breakup in October.\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said he would not move the trial, scheduled for April, in the event that DOJ officials appointed by Trump intend to revise the proposals.\n\"If there is going to be a re-evaluation of the remedies that are being requested, it needs to be done quickly,\" the judge said at a hearing.\nThe DOJ sued Google in 2020, during Trump's first term. Mehta ruled in August that Google holds an illegal monopoly in online search and related advertising.\nThe DOJ under U.S. President Joe Biden has proposed not only to make Google sell the world's most widely used Web browser, but also to share data and search results with rivals.\nThe wide-ranging proposal also seeks to prohibit Google to from buying or investing in search rivals, query-based artificial intelligence products or advertising technology.\nGoogle has called the proposals \"staggering,\" and said they would harm American competitiveness.\nHow artificial intelligence affects the landscape for online search is expected to be a key theme at the trial. Prosecutors have said they plan to call witnesses from ChatGPT creator OpenAI, artificial intelligence startup Perplexity, Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New YorkEditing by Matthew Lewis)\nView Comments"

Let\u2019s delve deep and find out factors that can assist investors in deciding whether it is a good entry point or one needs to wait longer for a better entry point.\nFactors Acting as Tailwind for Vistra\nVistra enjoys the benefit of increasing demand for clean electricity in its service region. The development of large load data centers and electrification of oil field operations, primarily in the Permian Basin, continue boosting demand for its services. Rising demand from semiconductor and industrial customers in VST\u2019s service region is improving demand. The company also gained from the addition of new residential customers in its service area.\n\nGoogle has been investing in its data centers in Texas, and the management of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet GOOGL, is also contemplating powering its data centers by sourcing electricity produced from nuclear power plants, which can create new opportunities for Vistra.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, Vistra has hedged 100% of its expected generation volumes for the rest of 2024, around 96% for 2025, and about 64% for 2026. The company's comprehensive hedging program and recent forward price curves support its 2024 guidance range.\n\nVistra has more than 70 sites with land and interconnects for the future development of clean energy projects. The company also received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate its Comanche Peak nuclear plant for an additional 20 years.\nVistra Raises Value of its Shareholders\nVistra continues to increase its shareholders' value through its share repurchase program and dividend payments.\n\nThe company expects to execute at least $3.25 billion of share repurchases for 2024-2026. Vistra has bought back shares worth more than $4.25 billion from November 2021, resulting in a 29% reduction in outstanding shares from November 2021 levels.\n\nVST\u2019s board of directors has also approved a quarterly dividend of 22.15 cents for the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting a sequential increase of 1%. Check VST\u2019s dividend history here.\nStory Continues\nVST\u2019s Earnings Estimates Move Up\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimates for Vistra\u2019s 2024 and 2025 earnings per share imply growth of 5.53% and 7.33%, respectively, in the last 60 days. The upward revision in earnings estimates indicates analysts\u2019 increasing confidence in the stock.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nVST\u2019s ROE Higher Than Its Industry\nVST\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 57.63%, ahead of the industry average of 10.98%. ROE, a profitability measure, reflects how effectively a company is utilizing its shareholders\u2019 funds in its operations to generate income.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nVistra Stock Trading at a Premium\nVistra is currently trading at a premium valuation compared to its industry, with its forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at 25.54X. The industry is currently trading at 16.6X.\n\nVistra is currently trading at a premium compared with another operator in the industry, Duke Energy Corporation DUK, which has a strong nuclear fleet. The current P/E- F12M ratio of DUK is 18.24X.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSumming Up\nVistra\u2019s earnings per share estimates have increased over the last 60-day period, and the company surpassed estimates in the last reported quarter. The company enjoys the benefit of rising demand for clean electricity in its service territory.\n\nVistra's comprehensive hedging program and more than 70 sites with land and interconnects for the future development of clean energy projects will allow it to move toward more clean electricity generation.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at a premium, so it is better to remain invested in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and enjoy the benefits of dividends and look for a better entry point later.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Along with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Musk, who has been candidly critical of CEOs from AI rivals including Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OpenAI and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), is headed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a committee advising Trump on governance changes.\nWorking with DOGE, the AI czar's duties would be leveraging AI techniques to fight waste, fraud, and abuse in government programs including entitlement fraud.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

        "whole_article": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +0.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +38.3%. This estimate has changed +4.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.91 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.9%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $81.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $294.74 billion and $330.37 billion estimates indicate +14.9% and +12.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $74.55 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.55 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $72.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +15.85%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Alphabet's ROE today.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n30% = US$94b \u00f7 US$314b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.30.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nAlphabet's Earnings Growth And 30% ROE\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Alphabet has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 7.5% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Alphabet's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nWe then compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 13% in the same 5-year period.\nNasdaqGS:GOOGL Past Earnings Growth November 26th 2024\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GOOGL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\nStory Continues\nIs Alphabet Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nAlphabet has a low three-year median payout ratio of 4.0%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 96% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.\nWhile Alphabet has seen growth in its earnings, it only recently started to pay a dividend. It is most likely that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.9% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.\nSummary\nOn the whole, we feel that Alphabet's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "whole_article": "It's all eyes on artificial intelligence PC demand and tariffs for HP Inc. (HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores entering 2025.\n\"Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be,\" Lores told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday (video above).\nThe comments on prices to consumers echo some of those made by Best Buy CEO Corie Barry today on her call with reporters.\nLores said he is looking forward to working with the incoming Trump administration and prefers smooth trading relationships between countries.\n\"We are a global company that does business in many parts of the globe, and that does development in many parts of the globe, and that has manufacturing in many parts of the globe. So for us, an easy way of trading across countries is the preferred option,\" Lores added.\nRead more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them?\nAs tariff convos whipsaw markets, HP released mixed fiscal fourth quarter sales results after the market close.\nSales of consumer PCs fell 4% in the quarter, while commercial sales improved 5%. Operating margins in the PC division fell sharply year over year.\nSimilar to the previous quarter, commercial clients are upgrading their computers ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025.\nConsumer PCs are under slight pressure as people await new AI computer releases and spend more money on experiences.\nWorldwide shipments of traditional PCs in the calendar year third quarter hit 68.8 million, down 2.4% year over year, according to data from IDC. Sales were hurt by rising costs and inventory replenishment in the prior quarter, IDC explained.\nEarnings analysis\nNet sales: $14.1 billion (+1.7% year over year) vs. $13.9 billion estimate\nPersonal systems sales: $9.6 billion (+2% year over year) vs. $9.7 billion estimate\nConsumer personal system sales: -4%\nCommercial personal system sales: +5%\nPrinting sales: $4.5 billion (+1% year over year) vs. $4.2 billion estimate\nConsumer printing sales: +3%\nCommercial printing sales: -1%\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS): $0.93 (+3% year over year) vs. $0.93 estimate (guidance: $0.89-$0.99)\nWhat else caught our attention\nWeak margins: Quarterly operating margins dropped to 8.5% from 9% a year ago\nPersonal systems operating margins fell to 5.7% from 6.7% a year ago\nPrinting operating margins rose to 19.6% from 18.9% a year ago\nFiscal first quarter EPS guidance: $0.70 to $0.76 vs. $0.86 estimate\nFull-year EPS guidance: $3.45 to $3.75 vs. $3.60 estimate\nStory Continues\n\"Demand, without a doubt, has returned for PCs amongst consumers and commercial buyers,\" IDC research manager Jitesh Ubrani said. \"However, much of the demand was still concentrated at the entry-level thanks to a recovering economy and the back-to-school season in North America. That said, newer AI PCs such as Copilot+ PCs from Qualcomm along with Intel and AMD's equivalent chips as well as Apple's expected M4-based Macs are expected to drive the premium segment in coming months.\"\nWhere HP surprised favorably for the first time in a while was its printing business.\nPrinting sales rose 1% from the prior year and came in ahead of expectations. The upside could stem from struggles at rival Xerox (XRX), which is smack in the middle of deep restructuring that pros say is causing market share loss.\n\"On print, results from peers such as Xerox came in below expectations, with Xerox's printing equipment sales declining double-digits year over year due in part to an increase in competitive activity in certain markets,\" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a client note.\nLores said HP is \"gaining share\" in the printing business, though declined to call out Xerox and cautioned the industry remains volatile.\n\"We think that the overall print market in 2025 will slightly decline. The decline will be less than what we saw this year, but our goal continues to be to perform better than the market,\" Lores said.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

OpenAI quickly shut down access to the leaked API on Tuesday.",
        "whole_article": "A group of artists volunteering as beta testers for OpenAI\u2019s new and unreleased AI video product, Sora, publicly shared access to the tool on Tuesday to protest what they said were the company\u2019s exploitative practices.\nIn an open letter posted on the Hugging Face platform and addressed to \u201ccorporate AI overlords,\u201d the group published the access to Sora\u2019s API, the special code that allows outside users to access the tool.\nThe group claimed they were invited by OpenAI to serve as Sora \u201ctesters\u201d and \u201ccreative partners,\u201d but realized they were being \u201clured into \u2018art washing\u2019 to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists.\u201d They also maintained that OpenAI controlled and approved all outputs, and that the early-access program appeared to be \u201cless about creative expression and critique, and more about PR and advertisement.\u201d\nSora is one of the most anticipated new products from OpenAI, the privately held company that makes ChatGPT and which has been valued at $157 billion. Generative AI video technology has the potential to upend Hollywood and many other creative industries that rely on video creation, from advertising to art. As word spread online about access to the Sora model on Tuesday, users quickly began posting their video experiments. \u201cIt can be shut down anytime, try it now!\u201d said one excited user on X. \u201cIt can generate 1080P and up to 10s video! And the results are incredible!\u201d\nFollowing the leak, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company has \u201ctemporarily paused user access while we look into this.\u201d The spokesperson emphasized that Sora is still in a research preview, and that \u201chundreds of artists\u201d have shaped Sora\u2019s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards. \u201cParticipation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been excited to offer these artists free access and will continue supporting them through grants, events, and other programs. We believe AI can be a powerful creative tool and are committed to making Sora both useful and safe.\u201d\nMarc Rotenberg, founder and executive director of the Washington, D.C.\u2013based Center for AI and Digital Policy, pointed out that the leak was \u201cdeeply ironic\u201d since OpenAI was first established as a company whose research was open to all. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason that Elon Musk put money into it, and it was the subsequent commercialization that explains the reason he became disenchanted,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you go back to his mission, I think you would celebrate what the artists did in this moment. But of course, if you\u2019re Microsoft, and you just poured in $10 billion to further your proprietary model, this is probably not a good day,\u201d Rotenberg said, referring to Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI.\nStory Continues\nIt\u2019s important to note that the news of the API access is much less devastating than if the entire Sora model\u2014including the code and weights (which serve as the \u201cbrains\u201d behind the model) had been leaked. OpenAI quickly shut down access to the leaked API on Tuesday.\nStill, the fact that the company\u2019s own beta testers are protesting is notable: Over the past several years, artists have voiced growing concerns about exploitative practices in the realm of generative AI, particularly around issues of copyright and content usage. Generative AI models often rely on vast datasets scraped from publicly available digital content, much of which includes artwork, illustrations, and other creative works created by artists.\nIn addition, AI-watchers have been extremely curious to find out how the highly anticipated OpenAI Sora model performs. In February, OpenAI released several high-definition video clips generated by Sora, but there have only been occasional demo videos released since then.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI news updates investors should not miss.\nA latest report into the adoption of AI in the United Kingdom has revealed that even though a lot of companies are using AI, only a few have integrated the new technology into their manufacturing processes. The study, called The Future Factories was carried out earlier this year in collaboration with design software giant Autodesk. The report warns that the lack of confidence in digital technologies and AI means companies in the UK are at risk of missing out on innovation and productivity gains. It also proposes how government initiatives and regulation can support the adoption of new technologies.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe report further highlights that manufacturers were mostly using AI to manage their energy usage and reduce waste. It added that some of the manufacturing sectors in which AI was being used were predictive maintenance and supply chain optimization. Per a survey cited in the study, the biggest benefits manufacturers cited were increased efficiency, improved productivity, and automation of routine tasks. The research highlights that the benefits show the importance of lowering the barrier to entry for these technologies and the untapped potential in this field for small manufacturers.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Earlier in the day, the company attributed slower speed to its recovery process but said it was working around the clock to address other problems.\nThis outage comes after a year of massive global tech disruptions. However, unlike previous events like the CrowdStrike IT failure this year, it did not have the same effect, paralyzing industries and causing billions of dollars in damages.\nSuch incidents have highlighted the dependence on cloud services as major business solutions. Organizations remain pressured to increase efforts to ensure their infrastructure can withstand some impacts during an outage.\nTo businesses and users, Microsoft's updates best illustrate the need to check service health portals for real-time recovery information continually. The tech giant also reiterated its intention to implement faster outage solutions to retain user trust in its Microsoft 365 ecosystem.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for CrowdStrike: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

The company expects next quarter\u2019s revenue to be around $1.03 billion, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.93 per share was 14.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Find out in our full research report.\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Q3 CY2024 Highlights:\nRevenue: $1.01 billion vs analyst estimates of $983.1 million (28.5% year-on-year growth, 2.8% beat)\nAdjusted EPS: $0.93 vs analyst estimates of $0.81 (14.9% beat)\nAdjusted Operating Income: $194.9 million vs analyst estimates of $169.3 million (19.3% margin, 15.1% beat)\nRevenue Guidance for Q4 CY2024 is $1.03 billion at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting\nAdj EPS Guidance\u00a0for Q4 CY2024 is $0.85 billion at the midpoint, missing what analysts were expecting by $0.01\nManagement raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $3.75 at the midpoint, a 3.3% increase\nOperating Margin: -5.5%, down from 0.4% in the same quarter last year\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 22.8%, down from 28.3% in the previous quarter\nAnnual Recurring Revenue: $4.02 billion at quarter end, up 27.5% year on year\nMarket Capitalization: $89.15 billion\n\u201cCrowdStrike surpassed $4 billion in ending ARR in the quarter - the fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone - as our single platform approach and trailblazing innovation continue to resonate at-scale,\u201d said George Kurtz, Founder and CEO.\nCompany Overview\nFounded by George Kurtz, the former CTO of the antivirus company McAfee, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cybersecurity software that protects companies from breaches and helps them detect and respond to cyber attacks.\nEndpoint Security\nAlmost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks. As the volume of internet enabled devices grows, every device that employees use to connect to business networks represents a potential risk. Endpoint security software enables businesses to protect devices (endpoints) that employees use for work purposes either on a network or in the cloud from cyber threats.\nSales Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, CrowdStrike grew its sales at an incredible 42.8% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth surpassed the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike Quarterly Revenue\nThis quarter, CrowdStrike reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 28.5%, and its $1.01 billion of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 2.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 22.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow by 20.4% over the next 12 months. This projection is still healthy and implies the market sees success for its products and services.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s ARR punched in at $4.02 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters, its growth was fantastic as it averaged 31.7% year-on-year increases. This performance aligned with its total sales growth and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes CrowdStrike a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nCrowdStrike Annual Recurring Revenue\nCustomer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments.\nCrowdStrike is very efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 24.4 months this quarter. The company\u2019s performance indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation. These dynamics give CrowdStrike the freedom to invest in new product initiatives while maintaining optionality.\nCrowdStrike CAC Payback Period\nKey Takeaways from CrowdStrike\u2019s Q3 Results\nIt was great to see CrowdStrike\u2019s positive full-year EPS guidance, which exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations. We were also happy its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS guidance for next quarter slightly missed. Overall, this quarter had some key positives, but it wasn't perfect. The stock is up a lot recently, showing heightened expectations, and shares traded down 3.8% to $350.82 immediately after reporting.\nIs CrowdStrike an attractive investment opportunity right now? What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free.\nView Comments"

CrowdStrike uses the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. CrowdStrike believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these measures eliminate the effects of certain variables unrelated to CrowdStrike\u2019s overall operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\nOther companies, including companies in CrowdStrike\u2019s industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of CrowdStrike\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate CrowdStrike\u2019s business.\nNon-GAAP Subscription Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Margin\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP subscription gross profit and non-GAAP subscription gross margin as GAAP subscription gross profit and GAAP subscription gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP income from operations as GAAP income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, and July 19 Incident related costs and (recoveries), net.\nNon-GAAP Net Income Attributable to CrowdStrike\nThe company defines non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to CrowdStrike excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, July 19 Incident related costs and (recoveries), net, acquisition-related provision (benefit) for income taxes, losses (gains) and other income from strategic investments, and losses (gains) on deferred compensation assets.\nNon-GAAP Net Income per Share Attributable to CrowdStrike Common Stockholders, Diluted\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, as non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that CrowdStrike defines as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software and website development costs, purchases of deferred compensation investments, and proceeds from sale of deferred compensation investments. CrowdStrike monitors free cash flow as one measure of its overall business performance, which enables CrowdStrike to analyze its future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow CrowdStrike to better understand the cash needs of its business. While CrowdStrike believes that free cash flow is useful in evaluating its business, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of free cash flow as a measure of CrowdStrike\u2019s liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in CrowdStrike\u2019s cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in CrowdStrike's industry, may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison.\nExplanation of Operational Measures\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nARR is calculated as the annualized value of CrowdStrike\u2019s customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. To the extent that CrowdStrike is negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, CrowdStrike continues to include that revenue in ARR if CrowdStrike is actively in discussion with such an organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies CrowdStrike that it is not renewing its subscription.\nMagic Number\nMagic Number is calculated by performing the following calculation for the most recent four quarters and taking the average: annualizing the difference between a quarter\u2019s Subscription Revenue and the prior quarter\u2019s Subscription Revenue, and then dividing the resulting number by the previous quarter\u2019s Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense. Magic Number = Average of previous four quarters: ((Quarter GAAP Subscription Revenue \u2013 Prior Quarter GAAP Subscription Revenue) x 4) / Prior Quarter Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense.\nFree Cash Flow Rule of 40\nFree cash flow rule of 40 is calculated by taking the current quarter total revenue year over year growth rate percentage and summing it with the current quarter free cash flow margin percentage.\nDollar-Based Gross Retention Rate\nDollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end is calculated by starting with the ARR from all subscription customers as of 12 months prior to such period, or Prior Period ARR. Then deduct from the Prior Period ARR any ARR from subscription customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Remaining ARR. Then divide the total Current Period Remaining ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of ARR from all subscription customers as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241126970319/en/\nContacts\nInvestor Relations Contact\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\nMaria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations\ninvestors@crowdstrike.com\n669-721-0742\nPress Contact\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\nJake Schuster, Senior Director, Public Relations & Media Strategy\npress@crowdstrike.com\nView Comments"

        "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 13 Stocks in Focus.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's game plan.\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the crucial events on Wall Street this week and emphasized the importance of watching upcoming earnings reports. He pointed out that the Thanksgiving period often brings a surge of optimism to the market. However, Cramer expressed concern that this enthusiasm is getting out of hand.\n\u201cThanksgiving tends to unleash the animal spirits of the market in a very positive way. I\u2019m no killjoy\u2026 but there's getting to be a little too much speculation for me and if we don't deal with it, if I don't talk about it, it's gonna become a problem.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight and Jim Cramer on Nvidia Plus Other Stocks\nCramer also turned his attention to Bitcoin, commenting on the growing buzz around the cryptocurrency. He expressed his hope that Bitcoin would finally reach the $100,000 mark so the conversation could move on. According to Cramer, the surge in Bitcoin's price is largely tied to speculation fueled by the President-elect's idea of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He noted that many people who had missed out on Bitcoin when it was trading lower are now justifying their purchases at these higher levels.\n\u201cAs long as it's legal, I'm all in but understand, I have nothing to offer on Bitcoin's $100,000 price tag, nor does anybody else, by the way, except to say this: This is what happens when there are more buyers than sellers.\u201d\nTurning to broader market trends, Cramer acknowledged that stock trading tends to slow down during the rest of the holiday week. However, he highlighted that Wednesday would bring the latest personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report from the government. This report, a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve, could give a clue as to whether the Fed will consider another rate cut before the year ends.\nCramer noted that the economy has been running hotter than the Fed would prefer, which has led to speculation that a rate cut in December might not be necessary. The situation is particularly challenging, he explained, because long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, have been rising since the Fed began its rate cuts. Normally, these rates would decrease in such an environment, so if the PCE report shows a cooler inflation reading, it could fuel another rally. On the other hand, if the report is hot, Cramer suggested it could trigger a downturn in some of the more speculative stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you have huge profits in the month of November, could you do me a favor? I would show a little thanks next week and take something off the table in your most risky positions.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on November 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\nCramer said that the time is nigh to buy CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) and stated:\n\u201cAfter the close, we have some big tech names reporting, including some that we own for the Charitable Trust. CrowdStrike, Dell Technologies, Workday. I think we might see these go 3, 4, 3. CrowdStrike's been on a charm offensive, that\u2019s George Kurtz, ever since that summer glitch heard around the world. I believe that CEO Kurtz has a free pass to say how the company's doing. So it might be a real good time to buy it ahead of the quarter, maybe pick some up this day.\u201d\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company recognized for its advanced Falcon platform, which offers a wide range of endpoint security solutions. In July, the company faced a significant IT outage due to a software glitch, causing disruption. The company swiftly addressed the issue. CEO George Kurtz mentioned during the last earnings call that while the outage delayed some contracts, most deals remain active in the sales pipeline.\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is set to release its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 on November 26. In late August, it projected that its revenue for the third quarter would fall between $979.2 million and $984.7 million, marking a year-over-year increase of approximately 25%.\nThe company\u2019s outlook for the full fiscal year 2025 is equally optimistic, with a revenue forecast ranging between $3.89 billion and $3.90 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 27% to 28% from the previous year. Additionally, management reiterated the company\u2019s commitment to its long-term ambition of reaching $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by the end of fiscal year 2031.\nOverall CRWD ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's game plan. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 32%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity products and services provider whose Falcon system was at the heart of one of the biggest IT outages earlier this year. Its shares are down 9% since the blackout and have gained 53% since the post-outage bottom. The recovery in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s stock is based on shifting investor attitudes about the firm's subscription revenue and legal implications stemming from the outage. As few legal troubles and customer switching surface, investors are slowly creeping back to CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s stock. However, the firm is continuing to face pressure from Delta Airlines because of the outage as the two companies have sued each other. Apart from the implications of the outage, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s $10 billion recurring revenue guidance for 2031 and a midpoint free cash flow margin guidance of 36% will continue to drive its margin due to the central role that the metrics play in any software company's hypothesis.\nBaron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.\u201d\nOverall CRWD ranks 4th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties.

In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options.\nNonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: \"It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software \u2014 and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.\"\nRelated Videos\n23:02\nNordstrom, Urban Outfitters earnings in focus: Asking for a Trend\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n20:32\nHP Q3 earnings, charitable donations: Market Domination Overtime\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n47:30\nAbercrombie & Fitch CEO, H&R Block CEO: Market Domination\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 4 hours ago\n08:08\nHP earnings: CEO Lores talks AI PC market and tariffs\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 4 hours ago\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\nThis post was written by Angel Smith\nView Comments"

The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company\u2019s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.\nHowever, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern.

The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\nYet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth.

High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind.

An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.\nThe hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.\nAnd while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.\nAnalysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) in the last month.\nHere are the major companies that have become popular shorts.\nPopular short stocks\nS3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.\nStory continues\nChipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.\nThe demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.\nAt the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.\nShares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.\nAnd Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.\nRead more: Rise in UK borrowing shows Reeves has 'little wiggle room' on spending\nThe discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.\nTesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.\nHowever, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve \"slight growth\" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.\nS3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).\nFollowing its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.\nS&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this \"may be related to the [US] election\".\nThey said that despite this significant activity in \"all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses\".\nGlobal short bets\nMeanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.\nThe data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on \"crowdedness\", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors\u2019 supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.\nLVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.\nThe company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an \"uncertain economic and geopolitical environment\" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.\nRead more: FTSE 100 and European-listed stocks to own in 2025, according to Barclays\nThe luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\nKering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.\nShares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.\nMultinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.\nDiageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIt has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.\nIn South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.\nRead more: What we know about planned UK private stock market Pisces\nHindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were \"nothing but a lie\".\nOn Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.\nShares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.\nIn a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were \"baseless\".\nHindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.\nHowever, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Computer and Technology peers, we might be able to answer that question.\nBroadcom Inc. is a member of our Computer and Technology group, which includes 619 different companies and currently sits at #2 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Broadcom Inc. is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO's full-year earnings has moved 5% higher within the past quarter. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.\nAccording to our latest data, AVGO has moved about 46.3% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, the Computer and Technology sector has returned an average of 28.4% on a year-to-date basis. This shows that Broadcom Inc. is outperforming its peers so far this year.\nOne other Computer and Technology stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is American Superconductor (AMSC). The stock is up 179.7% year-to-date.\nThe consensus estimate for American Superconductor's current year EPS has increased 117.7% over the past three months.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\nHow Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024\nHow Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.\nOf course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\nStory Continues\nBroadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.\nOur View\nWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers\u2014critical components for Nvidia\u2019s AI-focused operations.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nA strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.\nHistorically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s during major market reactions. Nvidia\u2019s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.\nHow To Buy AVGO Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\nStory Continues\nCheck It Out:\nArrived Achieved A Total Return of 34.7% On Their Biggest Sale Yet \u2014 Diversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nArrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord.

        "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

        "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)\nWhat a fantastic six months it\u2019s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is NOW a Good Business?\nFounded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.\n1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nServiceNow\u2019s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters,\u00a0its year-on-year growth averaged\u00a024.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nSell-side analysts expect ServiceNow\u2019s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nServiceNow\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate\nServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\nStory Continues\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on ServiceNow, and with the recent rally, the stock trades at 17.6x forward price-to-sales (or $1,055 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than ServiceNow\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

(NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and\u00a0ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAs the \u201cAI arms race\u201d continues to evolve, countries are increasingly beginning to realize the efforts they need to expend to stay relevant. One such country in the picture that\u2019s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Updates You Can\u2019t Miss This Weekend and Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight\nThe remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do \"everything they can to lock their digital doors\" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\"While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it\".\nMcFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.\nIn other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.\nThe search, which started on November 1st\u00a0took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it \u201ccannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs\u2019 copied articles were used to build [OpenAI\u2019s] models\u201d.\nStory Continues\n\u201cNews plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week\u2019s worth of its experts\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today\u201d.\nOpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.\nOn November 25, Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and a $1,150.00 price target. Key factors noted during a recent investor meeting have led to this buy rating. A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities. Another factor adding to the positive outlook is the disciplined approach to Pro Plus (the company's new generative AI SKU) pricing. The pressure on the Subscription Gross Margin in the coming year has already been factored into the analysis.\nOverall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nWhat's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?\nServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nCan we expect growth from ServiceNow?\nNYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nIf you'd like to know more about ServiceNow as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

While many are still bullish on further upside in the stock, we believe it's time to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the profits.\nServiceNow specializes in digital workflow automation, providing cloud-based workflow automation solutions that help organizations improve their operations. Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.\nThe company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.\nHard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage\nThe rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.\nApproximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.\nSome of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.\nOur bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft\u2019s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.\nCarahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn\u2019t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company\u2019s future relations with the government.\nIn a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.\nThis also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn\u2019t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock\u2019s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow ranks 24th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:\n14% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\nTo start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.\nNYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\nStory Continues\nIs ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nCramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:\n\u201cLet's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive\u2026 Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market\u2026 Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting\u2026 Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again\u2026 Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company\u2019s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.\nOverall NOW ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing \u201csovereign\u201d artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to \u201ccodify\u201d a country\u2019s culture, history, and collective intelligence.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News You Must Read Today.\nThat said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.\u201d\nWhile AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.\nLatest Advancements in AI\nIn recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday\u2019s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there\u2019s a catch.\n\u201cWhat if the Treasury doesn\u2019t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins\nEven though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.\nCramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump\u2019s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board\u2014on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains\u2014no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it\u2019s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses\u2026 It has always worked for the stock market.\u201d\nBut Cramer warned that there\u2019s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market\u2019s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf you believe we\u2019re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 12 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:NOW)\nTalking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:\n\u201cAs is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and\u2026 we\u2019re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications.
