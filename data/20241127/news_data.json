The representative didn\u2019t detail what was discussed but added that Zuckerberg wasn\u2019t staying for Thanksgiving.\nThe Facebook founder and other technology executives have been the target of blistering criticism from Republican lawmakers and commentators who said the major platforms had censored conservative views, an accusation the companies denied.\nZuckerberg and Trump have had a contentious relationship over the years, which became more intense after Facebook banned the then-president in January 2021 in the wake of the attack on the US Capitol.\nTrump later suggested he might even try to imprison Zuckerberg over accusations he had interfered in the 2020 election.\nEarlier: Meta\u2019s Zuckerberg Calls Trump Response to Shooting \u2018Badass\u2019\nMeta reinstated Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts in early 2023. After the July attempted assassination on Trump in Pennsylvania, Zuckerberg said in an interview with Bloomberg that \u201cseeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d\nZuckerberg spoke to Trump by telephone this fall, and posted a congratulatory note after he won the election earlier this month.\n\u201cWe do not comment on reports of private meetings that did or did not occur,\u201d Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said when asked about the Wednesday meeting.

Top executives from US-based firms were in China recently to meet with Chinese business leaders amid rumors of a massive spike in tariffs on goods being imported to Washington from Beijing.

However, the report adds that Musk is nevertheless expected to be involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases related to AI. xAI, the AI startup Musk founded in 2023, recently raised $5 billion in a funding round.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nDan Niles Bullish on Meta Platforms (META) After Earnings, Says Guidance Was Conservative\nTwin Design / Shutterstock.com\nMeta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 235\nDan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, discussed Meta earnings in a program on CNBC and said the stock remains among his favorites for the rest of this year.\nStory Continues\n\u201cMeta came out, had solid results, but they always guide conservatively in the September quarter for the outlook, and the stock sold off, which is what we expected it to do.\u201d\nDespite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\nAccording to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta\u2019s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks 3rd on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\nLatest reports suggest that the United Kingdom is launching a Laboratory for AI Security Research (LASR) to strengthen national security and cyber defense in response to evolving threats in the AI arms race.

The announcement follows heightened global concerns about state actors leveraging AI for malicious purposes, such as North Korea\u2019s use of AI for cyberattacks. Additionally, the UK government has also unveiled a \u00a31 million incident response initiative to bolster allied cyber defense capabilities, highlighting AI\u2019s dual potential as both a security risk and a tool for good.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

This showdown is about more than just old acquisitionsit's a battle over whether antitrust laws can keep up with the breakneck speed of today's tech landscape.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nJudge James Boasberg isn't making it easy for the FTC, though. While he's allowing the trial to move forward, he's already flagged serious challenges with their case. Meta's defense? The market has changed. Rivals like TikTok, YouTube of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and LinkedIn of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are thriving, so calling them a monopoly feels like reaching. But the FTC isn't backing down, arguing Meta's dominance in personal social networks didn't happen by chanceit happened by design.\nFor investors, this trial is the ultimate watch-and-wait game. If the FTC scores a win, it could shake up how Big Tech does business, especially when it comes to mergers and acquisitions. But if Meta prevails, it might reinforce the company's grip on the digital ecosystem and set a new benchmark for how far regulators can push antitrust cases. Either way, April 2025 isn't just a court dateit's a moment that could reshape the rules of the tech game for years to come.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Several hyperscalers have launched their own LLMs and chatbots in the past few months. Any updates related to these chatbots are followed eagerly by analysts. Anthropic, an AI startup that developed the Claude AI model, recently proposed a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the data that powers them. The startup claims that the system, called the Model Context Protocol, which is open source, would help AI models produce better and more relevant responses to queries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nIn a blog post, the AI startup underlined that as AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. However, the post added, even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data \u2014 trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Anthropic claims that MCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The judge also erred in holding a trial with a jury last year instead of deciding himself whether Google acted anticompetitively, the company said. Google says Donato\u2019s ruling would force it to do business with rival app stores \u2014 which the company contends it is not legally required to do.\nGoogle\u2019s appeal is \u201cmeritless\u201d and relies on \u201cflawed arguments,\u201d a spokeswoman for Epic said in a statement. \u201cWe will fight to ensure that the jury\u2019s verdict and the court\u2019s injunction are upheld and Google is held to account for its anticompetitive behavior.\u201d\nA San Francisco jury concluded in December 2023 that Google violated antitrust law by blocking rival app stores through a series of revenue-sharing agreements with mobile device makers like Samsung. Following up with a fix in October, Donato ordered Google to allow developers to set up app marketplaces and offer consumers billing options other than its own payment system.\n\u201cThis case involves an extraordinary attempt by a lone competitor to use the federal judiciary to restructure the day-to-day operations of Google\u2019s app store, Google Play, and to unilaterally reshape markets with consequences for millions of non-parties,\u201dGoogle said in its filing. The jury verdict and Donato\u2019s injunction, unless reversed, \u201cwill directly undercut Google\u2019s efforts\u201d to compete against Apple, Google said.\nEpic first sued Google and Apple in August 2020, accusing them of blocking competition for rival app stores. The judge in the Apple case largely ruled against Epic, though she directed the iPhone maker to make some changes to its App Store rules. Epic and Apple are currently fighting in an Oakland federal court over whether the iPhone maker is abiding by that ruling.\nStory Continues\nDonato has temporarily put his ruling on hold. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco can extend that delay pending the outcome of Google\u2019s appeal, or force Google to make changes to its business while simultaneously seeking to overturn the ruling.\nOral arguments are scheduled on Feb. 3 at the Ninth Circuit.\n(Updates with Epic statement in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

        "whole_article": "It\u2019s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you\u2019re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both.\nMy advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.\nHere are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you\u2019re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.\nVideo games\nVideo games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You\u2019ll find deals on consoles including Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo\u2019s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I\u2019m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.\nA worker holds a Playstation 5 at a Best Buy store during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Nov. 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Jim Vondruska) \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nDiscounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve\u2019s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.\nHeadphones\nWhether you\u2019re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you\u2019re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.\nThe fourth generation of AirPods is showcased as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, Calif., Sept. 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo/File Photo) \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nIt\u2019s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can\u2019t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you\u2019re into.\nYou\u2019ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.\nLaptops\nIn the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You\u2019re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple\u2019s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft\u2019s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That\u2019s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.\nStory Continues\nGenerally, when you\u2019re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That\u2019s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they\u2019ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.\nTVs\nTVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don\u2019t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.\nWhen it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you\u2019re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.\nTelevisions are displayed for sale ahead of Black Friday at a Walmart Supercenter on Nov. 14, 2023, in Burbank, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mario Tama via Getty Images\nIf there\u2019s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it\u2019s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don\u2019t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you\u2019re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG\u2019s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.\nPhones and tablets\nIf you\u2019re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you\u2019re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you\u2019ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.\nTablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they\u2019re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.\nSmart speakers and streaming devices\nAmazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.\nAmazon\u2019s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku\u2019s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google\u2019s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I\u2019ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Mac computers are also rarely gifted. They are both expensive and personal, often needing to meet specific needs.\"\nWith the introduction of iOS 18.2, which will have more Apple Intelligence capabilities, financial companies had predicted a possible increase in Apple iPhone sales this quarter. CIRP's results, however, imply that although iPads and Apple Watches enjoy a little increase throughout the season, iPhones and Mac computers are not very popular alternatives for Christmas presents.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The company ascribed the drop to longer replacement cycles, saturation of the smartphone market, and competition from a growing secondhand smartphone industry.\nThough behind Android's 7.6%, Apple's iOS is predicted to rise 0.4% in 2024. But iOS is expected to rise 3.1% year over year in 2025, surpassing Android's 1.7% increase.\nWith an average selling price of more than $1,000, Apple tops the sector in profitability according to IDC; Android competitors average $295.\n\"While GenAI continues to be a hot topic and top priority for many vendors, it is yet to impact demand significantly and drive early upgrades,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Track.\n\"While we continue to believe GenAI will revolutionize the user experience in the years to come, more investments are needed to increase consumer awareness and introduce a must have feature that will rush consumers to the store and create that super cycle which everyone is waiting for. For now, we expect GenAI smartphones will take their place in premium flagship devices and keep moving down in price tiers to rapidly grow to 70% of the smartphone market by 2028.\nPopal said generative AI-enabled smartphones would surpass premium devices and account for 70% of the market by 2028.\nApple's historic success is due to emerging countries like India, but it confronts problems in China, the US, and Europe.\nChinese manufacturers are transitioning from foldable handsets to generative AI smartphones, according to IDC's research director Anthony Scarsella. Foldables fell 7.4% in Q3 despite important vendor introductions. Scarsella said the category is predicted to expand 10.5% in 2024 and double-digit growth through 2028, with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 15.9%.

        "whole_article": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday.\nApple is reportedly changing its approach to software updates. The tech giant appears to be opting for staggered rollouts of new features instead of bundling everything into annual iOS releases.\nIn his latest weekly \u201cPower On\u201d newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said that Cupertino plans a significant update with iOS 18.4 this spring.\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.43%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest TODAY for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,410,360 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $282,072 or around 1,200 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.9% to close at $235.06 on Tuesday.\n\n\nRead More:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\nThe Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 15 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI news that broke the internet.\nOpenAI has been making headlines in the artificial intelligence realm ever since its existence, and it seems the company has something new to share almost every day. However, not all the\u00a0news surrounding the company is positive. In the latest news shared by\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0OpenAI has suspended access to its latest, highly anticipated video generation tool, Sora. This suspension followed a small group of artists who had leaked access to the tool to protest the treatment they\u2019ve been receiving at the company.\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News.\nArguing that the company used them as \u201cPR Puppets\u201d without pay, the artists created a webpage allowing anyone to make AI videos using Sora. OpenAI granted hundreds of artists free access to the video generation tool so that they could test out the new artificial intelligence video generator. However, 20 of these artists argued that the company had taken advantage of their unpaid labor. This is what the group of artists wrote on Hugging Face, an open-source repository for artificial intelligence projects.\n\u201cHundreds of artists provide unpaid labor through bug testing, feedback and experimental work for the program for a $150B valued company\u201d.\nThe artists further added that the opportunities offered in return for helping the company, such as being selected to have their Sora-created films screened, offer \u201cminimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives. The tool was public three hours before it was shut down. OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said that the company has temporarily shut down user access to Sora while it looks into the situation.\n\u201cHundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora\u2019s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards. Participation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool.\u201d\nIn other news, Axios reported that President-elect Donald Trump is considering naming an \"AI czar\" in the White House that will be coordinating federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence. While Elon Musk isn\u2019t going to be the AI czar, he is expected to be involved.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

For example, Pony AI, a China-based autonomous vehicle technology company, recently held an initial public offering that saw shares jump 15% in the market debut, pushing the valuation of the firm to more than $5.25 billion. News agency Reuters reports that the successful debut also suggested a positive investor approach to China-based firms.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe IPO price of the stock was $13 per share but the depositary shares opened at $15 in their Nasdaq debut, per the report. Even after the stellar debut, the new company faces several challenges, the report added, including public skepticism about autonomous vehicles, data privacy concerns, and competition from companies, including Tesla which has promised to roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year.

        "whole_article": "It\u2019s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you\u2019re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both.\nMy advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.\nHere are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you\u2019re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.\nVideo games\nVideo games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You\u2019ll find deals on consoles including Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo\u2019s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I\u2019m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.\nA worker holds a Playstation 5 at a Best Buy store during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Nov. 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Jim Vondruska) \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nDiscounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve\u2019s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.\nHeadphones\nWhether you\u2019re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you\u2019re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.\nThe fourth generation of AirPods is showcased as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, Calif., Sept. 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo/File Photo) \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nIt\u2019s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can\u2019t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you\u2019re into.\nYou\u2019ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.\nLaptops\nIn the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You\u2019re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple\u2019s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft\u2019s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That\u2019s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.\nStory Continues\nGenerally, when you\u2019re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That\u2019s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they\u2019ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.\nTVs\nTVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don\u2019t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.\nWhen it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you\u2019re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.\nTelevisions are displayed for sale ahead of Black Friday at a Walmart Supercenter on Nov. 14, 2023, in Burbank, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mario Tama via Getty Images\nIf there\u2019s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it\u2019s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don\u2019t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you\u2019re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG\u2019s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.\nPhones and tablets\nIf you\u2019re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you\u2019re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you\u2019ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.\nTablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they\u2019re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.\nSmart speakers and streaming devices\nAmazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.\nAmazon\u2019s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku\u2019s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google\u2019s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I\u2019ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Amazon.com's ROE.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n19% = US$50b \u00f7 US$259b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.19 in profit.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nAmazon.com's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE\nTo begin with, Amazon.com seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 23%. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nAs a next step, we compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 15% in the same period.\nNasdaqGS:AMZN Past Earnings Growth November 27th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.\nStory Continues\nIs Amazon.com Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nAmazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.\nConclusion\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings.

By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nOver half a decade, Netflix managed to grow its earnings per share at 41% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 23% over the same period.

        "whole_article": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - Netflix won the dismissal on Tuesday of a shareholder lawsuit accusing the streaming company of downplaying the impact on subscriber growth of account sharing, where paying members share user names and passwords with nonpaying members in other households.\nThe proposed class action led by a Texas-based trustee began after Netflix revealed in April 2022 it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the prior quarter, the first decline in a decade, and might lose 2 million more in the next three months.\nNetflix blamed the decline on several factors, including account sharing, rising competition and a shutdown of service in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Its shares fell 35% the next day, wiping out more than $54 billion of market value.\nU.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in Oakland, California, however, said Netflix's earlier claims to be \"roughly 60% penetrated\" in the United States and Canada with \"a lot of headroom\" to grow were not false or misleading, because they referred to paid subscribers and did not imply that growth was certain.\nHe also found no proof Netflix concealed any determination that account sharing would severely hinder growth.\n\"At most,\" he said, the plaintiff's allegations suggest that the Los Gatos, California-based company investigated account sharing and found it to be \"one potential threat to growth among many.\"\nLawyers for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Netflix and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.\nTigar had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit in January. Tuesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, the trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, cannot amend his complaint again.\nThe case is Pirani v Netflix Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-02672. (This story has been refiled to change the location of the judge to Oakland, California, from San Francisco, in paragraph 4)\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

        "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.\nStory Continues\nLast week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.\nNetflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyonc\u00e9 will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.\nThe company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nJefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a \"breakthrough\" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.\nBofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, \"Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.\"\nNetflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.\nStill, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat \u2014 a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.\n\"With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.\nValuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock \"is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025.\" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Please refer to the disclaimer on slide 2 within the accompanying presentation. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Dan Roberts.\nDaniel Roberts\nThanks Lincoln. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. Thank you for dialing in. It's an interesting time in the market, and we're pleased to have the opportunity to present both our results from the prior quarter. But also importantly, step you through how we're thinking about the short-term as well as the medium and long term.\nSo it's an exciting time for us, exciting time for the industry. So let's dive into it. So jumping straight through to slide 3, make sure everyone's read the disclaimer on slide 2.\nSo I think it's fair to say that the Bitcoin mining sector is reaching an inflection point. It's a very dynamic time in the market, and we fielded a number of questions around why miners are underperforming the price of Bitcoin over the recent months.\nAnd what we're seeing is institutional interest returning to the space. But the question around, why isn't miners necessarily or why aren't they necessarily moving Bitcoin given it's meant to be some sort of proxy exposure, what's different this cycle. So from our perspective, we are seeing that the sector has matured. There are more ways for investors to express interest in Bitcoin. Miners that built their business around a hole strategy now have more competition than ever for that business model.\nYou're seeing institutional grade self-custody solutions. You're seeing the emergence of the ETFS. You're seeing companies like MicroStrategy accumulate Bitcoin through capital market products. In contrast, we're positioned as a low cost commodity producer, focused on cash on cash returns for our investors and producing Bitcoin at low cash cost. Circa $29,000 per Bitcoin as we'll see in the coming slides.\nSo mining business models are under scrutiny. This is an environment in which we expect a low cost, strong cash flow business to thrive. So as you can see, they're on the right hand side, business fundamentals, they're coming into focus production costs, operational, focus, capital allocation, and the outlook for growth. We believe we're well positioned for market leadership in every aspect although and ultimately, we view Bitcoin mining as Gold Mining 2.0.\nCould I just ask that other speakers on the line from our side? Go on mute, please. There's a bit of background noise. Thank you. So if we could then move to slide 4. It's also an inflection point for our business, 31 exahash is weeks away.\nIn fact, I believe that the last miner is going to be delivered in the next seven days. Installation commissioning will take a little bit longer than that. But the 31 exahash is now weeks away making us one of the largest listed miners. Just as Bitcoin is hitting an all-time high, however, those that know us, we're not stopping there.\nWe are also pleased to announce that we are accelerating our expansion to 50 exahash into the first half of next year, previously it was the second half. So we've been able to bring all that forward and continuing to invest to generate more Bitcoin at an expected cash cost of $29,000 per coin.\nThe fundamentals of our business model have allowed us to continue to accelerate growth at low cost. Our strategy focusing on large scale projects continuing to provide a lower execution risk in a rapid platform to expand. Years of planning and procuring long lead items to mitigate supply chain risks, and finally our management capability to deliver. If we have set a target in the market, we hit it, and we will continue to do that.\nThis is a business model now, and this is a business in IREN, where we believe we've hit that inflection point, we've hit the economies of scale now. While we will talk more on unit economics over the coming slides at 31 exahash, we expect to be producing Bitcoin at an all in cash cost of $29,000 per coin.\nWith those economics and those unit economics only to improve as we scale as power costs and operating leverage really start to kick in. In relation to AI and HPC, we've got almost 2000 GPUs now operating combination of H100, H200, both NVIDIA generations. We're focused on contracting out this capacity and looking for opportunities to grow in a measured way based on robust contractual arrangements and demand that we're seeing in the market.\nIn respect to AI co-location and other monetization opportunities, they're also being progressed in parallel. We have high quality assets that we believe will remain valuable in a power constrained market with increasing competition from both Bitcoin mining and AI for this land and power.\nWe will continue not to provide guidance on specific terms or timing, given the uncertainties, given the nature that we are dealing with counterparties, it is not all within our control. However, we continue to progress negotiations with some very large counterparties and hyperscalers. We will update the market as appropriate and as we have news.\nIn terms of what is within our control, as we know the majority of the new generation Blackwell's from NVIDIA, those GPUs will require liquid cooling. So notwithstanding successful testing of our GPU clusters in free cooling environments, including at Childress, we will also be installing our liquid cooling infrastructure at both our Prince George and Childress data centers in the coming months to ensure we are ready to support this next generation of GPUs.\nThis creates opportunities for the business both across our cloud platform, as well as our co-location pathway in terms of corporate and funding initiatives. So in terms of funding, it's clear to say market conditions have improved materially over recent months, more funding options are emerging beyond the ATM.\nWe are focused, very focused on alternative funding instruments as part of funding our upcoming growth plans, for example, convertibles, and we'll continue to progress that over the coming months. In terms of becoming a US domestic issuer, we intend to transition to this status in 2025, reporting on a US GAAP basis.\nWe have also been working on potential inclusion in major US indices, for example, the Russell 2000 in the near term, given the majority of our assets are in the US. Finally, our increased scale at 31 exahash and not long after that 50 exahash combined with our non-hoddle approach i.e. we don't hold Bitcoin on our balance sheet. We mine at an expected all in cash costs of $29,000.\nIt's anticipated to generate very substantial operating cash flows in the near term. As such, we believe this will support potential investor distributions in 2025. We're working through specific details around what that might look like, however, we wish to again signal our commitment, and our focus on prudent capital management and generating strong cash on cash shareholder returns.\nSo moving along to slide 6, a little bit more about Bitcoin mining. So where we're at, we have been delivering consistent growth over the last couple of years. If we set a target, we have met it. We're now at 21 exahash above the 20 exahash previously guided and 31 exahash is just weeks away as I mentioned earlier. We're not stopping there, we are continuing 50 exahash in the first six months of next year.\nSo we are committed to hitting these targets. We will maintain our disciplined approach to delivery. Our focus on costs, our focus on safety. It's supported by our single site expansion at Childress where we have over 400 people on site who will continue the cadence of building out 50 megawatts of data centers every month.\nNo M&A is required, it's all organic growth at cost. The land in Childress cost us a few million dollars. That is it. Everything has been self-developed internally by our team. Proven people, proven delivery processes, and the strategy to focus on large scale projects continues to provide lower execution risk, more certainty and a platform that allows us to rapidly expand at low cost.\nOn the mining hardware side, you'll recall that we previously secured minor purchase options for S21 Pro miners at a fixed price of $18.90, these options were struck when Bitcoin was 65,000. It's taken the last six years to get our platform up to this stage.\nThe vision to accumulate organic development of large scale sites, building a team and know how raising capital we've now hit that inflection point, just as we are seeing, the real world really start to lag the digital world.\nThere is significant megawatts, significant minors, significant capital, and management expertise required from this point for the network i.e. the hashrate at a global level to scale in parallel with the Bitcoin price. Against this backdrop, there's now increasing competition for a number of those inputs, transformers, land, power with the AI traditional data center world. Now also competing for exactly the same core inputs.\nTo play this out with a simple thought exercise, what happens if Bitcoin moves up to 150,000? 50%? All of a sudden, you need another 7,000 megawatts of additional capacity, another $9 billion in CapEx. Transformers, long lead items, cables, networking, concrete steel, all these things that take time that are fraught with risk.\nAll of it to bring into the real world, real projects, real data centers, the ASIC, you cannot plug an ASIC into a high voltage transmission line, it just doesn't work. So we've set ourselves up to really become a leading force in Bitcoin mining. On slide 7 to really drill into this $29,000 cash cost per Bitcoin. We have driven it down, it is happening.\nBest in class efficiency at 15 joules per terahash from 22 in the recent September quarter. Expansion at low power cost. Childress, our average power cost is a tick over $0.03 since moving the spot price with our automated curtailment algorithm a few months ago, that is becoming a larger and larger proportion of our portfolio, driving down our average power cost accordingly.\nAnd then overheads nonpower costs, but all in cost of our business, we're really starting to see the benefits of operating leverage come through. We'll talk more to this on coming slides, but it's effectively spreading our corporate cost base across a much larger number of exahash a much larger number of expected Bitcoin mined.\nSo finally, in terms of operating efficiency, we believe in building high quality data centers that optimize operating conditions for our miners. It's really important to us that we maintain the highest levels of uptime and look after that fleet to maximize profitability.\nMoving on to slide 8, illustrative mining economics. Some of you would have seen this on Twitter previously but one exahash of operating capacity costs are in approximately $30 million to deliver. Against a market backdrop where capital markets are valuing that at almost four times that valuation, $120 million. If you have the ability to deliver at $30 million to have something valued at $120 million, that in my simple mind, that makes a lot of sense to continue pursuing.\nWe see investing in additional capacity as highly accretive. It's a really simple framework for thinking about this, the unit economics to crosscheck that in terms of cash flow, $13 million of net illustrative adjusted EBITDA on a $30 million CapEx, it's around a two-year payback again, making a lot of sense.\nSo as we're looking all in cost to produce, you'll notice on the right hand side, a step up in renewable energy certificate costs as we continue expanding at Childress, this highlights our commitment to 100% renewable energy.\nWe're seeing the sustainability focus really come to the fore. There are lots of different claims out in the market around supporting renewables. At Childress, notwithstanding, 80% of the network in that area is renewable, you need the certificates. If you do not have certificates, you are not operating with renewable energy.\nAt the moment, a wind farm or a solar farm evacuates power into the grid, the commodity is bifurcated into two components. One is the electron that trades alongside black and brown power, the other is the certificate. If you do not buy those certificates, you are not renewable because someone else will own those certificates, and we'll be double counting it.\nSo this has absolutely been a critical part of our strategy, we've bought it for every electron since day one, and we will continue to do that. A key part of how we are also thinking about growth is accretion on a per share basis. How do we drive value for every shareholder in our business?\nOne example of how we're thinking about this is in the bottom right hand table. We've shown this analysis in terms of adjusted EBITDA per share, which highlights very strong accretion metrics as we continue to scale from 31 to 50 exahash.\nWe have also set out some illustrative share price levels at which equity is raised, whether that be through ordinary equity convertibles, or other alternative funding structures. We've seen a number of convertibles launched over recent months with creative strike prices, and we'll continue to look at that as all but one of our pathways to raise additional capital.\nSo yes, growing from $400 million to $700 million of illustrative EBITDA in the top right hand corner is super exciting but more exciting for us, is the creative nature of this growth and our continued commitment to drive cash on cash shareholder returns.\nOn that note, I'd like to pass over to Kent, to talk about AI and HPC.\nStory Continues\nKent Draper\nThanks Dan. With respect to our AI Cloud Service commissioning of our recently acquired NVIDIA H200 GPUs at our Prince George data center Location is now complete. The transition from Bitcoin mining to GPUs was able to be completed in a matter of weeks. Underscoring the multipurpose nature of our data centers, and ability to rapidly scale to support customer growth ambitions.\nNow that capacity is installed, we're focused on contracting out the new capacity and currently have customer trials underway. To that point, we've also been increasing our activity with respect to marketing and go to market initiatives.\nAs an example, in conjunction with the recent Supercompute conference in Atlanta, we hosted roundtable events in San Francisco with commercial leaders in the AI sector and have more a activity planned for the future.\nOur current fleet of NVIDIA H100 H200 GPUs supports approximately $32 million of potential annualized hardware profits using less than 2.5 megawatts of data center capacity. To put that into perspective, that's less than 0.5% of our total year end data center capacity.\nThis is one of the elements that we particularly like about the cloud services offering. It's highly complementary to our existing operations and doesn't cannibalize our data center capacity for other use cases such as AI colocation.\nOur strategy is to continue focusing on measured growth of our capacity in response to customer demand backed by good contracts and solid utilization of that capacity. In relation to colocation and other monetization opportunities, we believe that we have high quality assets which will become more and more valuable in an increasingly power constrained market, and as Dan referred to earlier, there's increasing competition for sites to support both Bitcoin mining and AI.\nWe expect competition for large scale grid connected power to intensify over the coming months, given some of the dynamics in the market including continued growth and adoption of AI regulatory complexities with behind the meter solutions. So for example, the recent FERC rejection of the AWS-Talen interconnect at the Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and also the timeline for new nuclear generation and other generation sources to come online.\nAs a result, we're seeing West Texas sites increasingly coming into focus, and there have been several hyperscaler projects announced in the region in recent months. For example, the Crusoe data center project in Abilene. With respect to our discussions underway, we continue to advance negotiations with interested parties on a range of structures for our sites, including powered land leases and built to suit contracts.\nAs Dan mentioned, we aren't providing guidance on terms or timing at this stage, but as we've said previously, we're actively negotiating potential transactions with hyperscalers and we'll update the market on material developments as appropriate. Monetizing our data center platform into new verticals remains a key focus for management.\nWe're committed to maximizing shareholder value and any transaction must reflect the strategic value of our assets. With respect to liquid cooling, our team has extensive experience designing and operating data centers optimized for power dense compute and a demonstrated execution capability. We're leveraging that experience to best position our infrastructure for opportunities in the rapidly evolving AI sector.\nFor instance, as many people will be aware, certain variants of the Blackwell generation of NVIDIA GPUs require liquid cooling. It's notwithstanding the success and the successful testing of our GPU clusters in our current free air cooling environment, we will be installing liquid cooling infrastructure at both our Prince George and Childress sites to ensure that we're ready to support the next generation of GPUs.\nWe expect this to create additional opportunities for us across both the cloud services and colocation pathways. As we touched on in the previous slide, I'm on slide 12 now, we see significant strategic value in our land and power portfolio and parties are turning their attention to power and capacity requirements for 2026 and beyond.\nToday, we're excited to announce the location of our 1.4 gigawatt Sweetwater Data Center project which is immediately adjacent to the utility's high voltage substation and approximately 60 miles from the regional hub Abilene in West Texas. During the quarter, we've continued to push forward with development activities including securing an additional 800 acres of land adjacent to our existing freehold hold land, bringing our total landholding at the site to over 1,300 acres.\nWe've also accelerated the timeline for upgrades and energization of the utility substation from October 2026 to April 2026. Furthermore, we've commenced procurement to support the 1.4 gigawatt substation energization by April of 2026, including procurement of transformers, circuit breakers, and ancillary electrical equipment at 1,400 megawatts. This single site is larger than many entire data center markets in the US and it has the potential to be the largest Bitcoin mining facility or AI factory in the world, capable of supporting over 90 exahash of Bitcoin mining or over 800,000 GPUs.\nOn to slide 13. In relation to our powerful portfolio, we've spent years developing our current 2.3 gigawatts of contracted capacity. Our approach with respect to the market is only to announce sites where we have executed interconnection agreements.\nThis means they're not potential future megawatts, these are genuine megawatts that are contracted today through binding interconnection agreements. We've observed first hand within our own portfolio, some of the timeline, delays in securing grid approvals. And as Dan mentioned, there are a number of risks associated with development and securing capacity, which underscores the strategic value of having these megawatts contracted today, and especially at large individual sites.\nWithout signed interconnection agreements, the quantum of megawatts timing and cost is highly uncertain. That is why on our calls, we only highlight the 2.3 gigawatts of signed interconnections. However, we continue to develop our data center portfolio and hope to provide updates in due course on our pipeline of over 1 gigawatt of data center sites, if we're successful in signing additional interconnection agreements at those sites.\nImportantly, the interconnection agreements that we have executed provide for uninterruptible power. So that means no mandatory curtailment. Any curtailment that we do is entirely voluntary in order to reduce our power costs at those sites.\nAdditionally, we've continued to invest internally in our development capability including growing our commercial teams at our North American headquarters. And we'll continue to look to accelerate our development activities globally and add to our organic pipeline, which means less reliance on M&A transactions to support our future growth.\nNow I'll pass over to Belinda, our CFO to walk through the financial results.\nBelinda Nucifora\nThank you, Kent. Good morning, to those in Sydney, and good afternoon, to those in North America. Thank you for joining us for our Q1 FY25 earnings update. As a start, I'm going to highlight our operating leverage as we scale our Childress operations.\nEarlier in the presentation, Dan highlighted the illustrative mining economics on our path to 50 exahash. As shown on the slide, as we scale from today's installed capacity of 21 exahash to 50 exahash, we see potential for significant improvement in our unit economics.\nThe group key drivers to this being attractive power prices at Childress with the transition to spot pricing made on August 1, 2024, a reduction in the energy cost per Bitcoin mined across the portfolio due to the increased mining contribution from Childress at a lower cents per kilowatt hour price, coupled with improved fleet efficiency to the industry leading at 15 joules per terahash.\nFurthermore, as we scale overheads are spread over a larger revenue base. As such overheads on a per exahash basis are expected to decrease by approximately 70% from Q1 FY25 as we scale to 50 exahash. This contributes to a significant reduction in our all in cash cost per Bitcoin of approximately $28,000 being the lowest in the industry.\nAs touched on earlier by Dan in the presentation, to finance this growth will be focused on alternative funding instruments. In addition, at scale, the achievement of positive operating cash flows may support a potential for investor distribution in calendar year 2025.\nMoving on to the next slide. Further to the operating leverage we just discussed, this sets out the illustrative economics at various Bitcoin prices. The first column of the table shows illustrative economics at 31 exahash and 50 exahash with a Bitcoin price of $90,000 and a current network hashrate of 732 exahash.\nThis results in an estimated adjusted EBITDA of $435 million and $714 million respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown in the table sets out the illustrative economics associated with Bitcoin prices starting at $125,000 and scaling by 25,000 intervals to $200,000 at an implied network hashrate of 1,000 exahash.\nThis results in adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion at a Bitcoin price of $200,000. The estimated increase in overheads as we scale from 31 exahash to 50 exahash is approximately $23 million, primarily attributable to variable Childress site related costs, including property insurance and property county taxes.\nAlso mentioned earlier, we're 100% committed to renewable energy and our investment in renewable certificate costs increase as we scale from $9 million at 31 exahash to $16 million at 50 exahash. Our overheads reflect a business contributing to deliver significant growth. We have onboarded technical and go-to-market resources for our AI business and have built internal site development expertise to scale our broader portfolio.\nThis makes us less reliant on competitive M&A processes to scale our platform, and we see this as a strategic advantage. Moving on to the next slide, I'll touch on the quarterly results. During the quarter, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million with Bitcoin mining revenue of $54.3 million and AI cloud services revenue of $3.2 million.\nThe average operating hashrate for the quarter increased from 9 exahash to 12.1 exahash and we mined 821 Bitcoin at an average realized price of $66,000. Net electricity costs for the quarter increased by $4.6 million to $28.7 million. This was primarily due to the increased Childress megawatt usage as we scaled as well as the Childress energy procurement in July 2024, which was under a fixed cost, fixed quantity contract.\nFrom August 1, 2024, Childress procurement transitioned to a spot pricing strategy. If that spot pricing strategy had been in place for the entire quarter, the cost of Bitcoin mine would have been $26,700 versus a $35,400.\nAs discussed in the previous slide, other costs of $21.4 million reflects a business today that is delivering significant growth and projected continued expansion over the coming years. The primary driver of the quarter on quarter increase of $0.4 million is due to Childress construction and operational insurance costs.\nNow moving to our cash flows. Closing cash at bank at September 30 is reported as $98.6 million with strong receipts from Bitcoin mining activities of $49.6 million and AI cloud services of $3.7 million. The increase in electricity payments made during the quarter includes the one off liquidation payment of $7.2 million related to the transition to spot pricing strategy from August 1, 2024.\nWe increased our investing activities and spent a total of $387 million, which relates to expansion at Childress data center, the purchase of Bitmain S21 Pros and T21 Miners as part of the pathway to the 31 exahash and the purchase of NVIDIA H200 GPUs.\nWe raised $84 million of net ATM proceeds during the quarter and post that $142 million from net ATM proceeds. Cash increased to $182.4 million at October 31, 2024. We'll now turn to the balance sheet. At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of $1.3 billion, no debt and a strong balance sheet providing flexibility to fund future growth.\nTotal equity increased to $1.1 billion with gross proceeds of $76 million from 9.1 million shares sold under the ATM. As touched on earlier in the presentation by Dan, to finance future growth, we'll be focused on alternative funding instruments and in addition, at scale, the achievement of positive operating cash flows may support a potential for investor distribution in calendar year 2025.\nI'll now turn over for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nLucas Pipes, B. Riley Securities.\nLucas Pipes\nThank you very much, operator, and good day everyone. My first question is on Sweetwater, and how you think about the strategic process versus the organic opportunity at the site? Thank you very much for your perspective on that.\nDaniel Roberts\nThanks, Lucas. Nice to see you. Look, the short answer is there's no decision point right now beyond procuring long lead items around the electrical infrastructure, so transformers, substation components, et cetera. So we're in a position to prepare dual pathways, both for Bitcoin mining as well as AI related opportunities on the colocation or otherwise.\nSo we're pursuing it in all parallel. And the reality is we're facing a number of different potential pathways. And the opportunity is to compare each pathway to each other as an opportunity cost. And it's everything from building out Bitcoin mining.\nAnd if we can continue to build at $30 million and have the market value that exahash at $120 million, then that sounds pretty good. All the way through to build to suit options where we might build an AI data center for a counterparty under a build to suit model.\nAnd again, internally deliver a component of that. There's structures like power and land, leases in there as well. So at this stage, it's working through all the options in parallel and just playing them off against each other.\nLucas Pipes\nI appreciate that. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on the capital intensity on the Bitcoin mining business. Should we kind of think of that $30 million per exahash in a linear fashion up to 50? And if so, could you just remind us what the capital requirement is from where you are today to that 50 exahash ? How much capital is needed? Thank you very much for calling.\nDaniel Roberts\nYes, for sure. So we haven't guided a specific number, partly because there's a number of moving parts around do we buy additional GPUs, because there's a spike in demand and the customer would like that. We're buying long lead items for Sweetwater.\nBut if we look in really high level terms, we previously announced that we were fully funded to the 30 exahash. Since then, we've raised about $200 million-ish under the ATM, that gives a $400 million funding requirement to go from 30 to 50.\nYes, we've had higher operating cash flows than expected because of the Bitcoin price action. But again, that's somewhat offset by other CapEx. So we haven't guided specific numbers, but in general terms, you can probably triangulate roughly what we need.\nLucas Pipes\nDan and team. I really appreciate all the color, and wish you best of luck. Thank you.\nDaniel Roberts\nThank you.\nOperator\nJoseph Vafi, Canaccord Genuity.\nJoseph Vafi\nEveryone, good morning. Nice to see all the progress on so many fronts. It's great. Just kind of starting with a theoretical one, we've got a much higher Bitcoin spot price than we did, and you're now mentioning potential. It sounds like maybe a dividend or something like that next year. Just wondering at what Bitcoin level and kind of what level of exahash do you think at least the Bitcoin business can keep growing kind of more on a self-funded basis moving forward versus balance sheet related financing? And then I'll have a quick follow up.\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, sure. So we think about operating cash flows a little bit separate to investing cash flows where there are two separate decision points in our mind. So the first is operating cash profits. So how much are you generating from your operations as a going concern, and what do we do with that cash flow. The second is what is the decision around reinvestment of those cash flows.\nNow, I think it's fair to say that for quite some time, 100% of all the capital we raise is going into revenue generating CapEx and using our operations to continue to support building our corporate overheads, our operating base, et cetera. And as you can see in the presentation, we're now hitting that inflection point where operating cash flows are going to be potentially substantial.\nSo the decision to reinvest those cash flows as distinct from distributing those cash flows to investors is something that we'll work through. But when you look at the market today and you see a number of different companies accumulating Bitcoin on their balance sheet, paying market price or close thereof to it, and we've got the opportunity to generate Bitcoin and effectively acquire Bitcoin at a cash cost of $29,000 and distribute that Bitcoin/cash out to investors who can then self-custody.\nWe're not that big of believers in third party custody. We've been around Bitcoin since 2013, ridden Mt. Gox, FTX, et cetera. So I think the opportunity to generate a $29,000 cash cost Bitcoin for investors and effectively distribute that coin out either through the physical coin, we'll have to look into that, or as cash flow is pretty powerful.\nAnd I think it's important to keep that separate from investing in cash flows and how we might fund that to continue to drive that cost potentially down even lower, but drive it in aggregate.\nJoseph Vafi\nThat's great color. And potentially exciting there in actually distributing the underlying Bitcoin instead of cash. And then just congrats on being able to announce the Sweetwater site. That's nice progress. Just, I know you started to talk about some long lead time items there. Are you going to try to get enough long lead time items for the full 1.4 gigawatts or do you think that there's a step progress there? And then any update on fiber and if you're going to have to invest on fiber interconnect for that site? Thanks a lot.\nKent Draper\nDan. I'm happy to jump in and take that one. So with respect to the full capacity there on the data center side, it will take some time to build it out. As Dan referred to earlier, we're currently at Childress able to build out about 50 megawatts a month in terms of data center capacity. So to build out a site the size of the Sweetwater data center site, it will take some period of time.\nBut what we're doing with the procurement of long lead items is enabling the full capacity on the high voltage substation. So this is the substation that allows you to connect into the high voltage utility grid. And then we will build out the remaining site substations and data center capacity on a progressive basis. But the long lead procurement is set up in a way to enable us to energize the entire bulk high voltage substation to the full capacity on that April 2026 timeline.\nJoseph Vafi\nGreat. Thanks Kent. And then any update on fiber at Sweetwater. Thanks a lot guys.\nKent Draper\nYes. So in terms of fiber, there are multiple Tier 1 carriers in the area, including right up to the existing utility substation. So access to fiber is not an issue. In terms of latency, because these are Tier 1 providers, the latency to all major hyperscaler hubs is very good as well. So sub 20 milliseconds latency and sub 10 milliseconds in a number of cases. So the fiber position at that site is suitable for almost all AI applications, as well as Bitcoin mining, obviously.\nJoseph Vafi\nSure. That's all positive news. Thanks for that color, Kent.\nOperator\nDarren Aftahi, Roth.\nDarren Aftahi\nHi guys. Good morning. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I may. First, I'm just curious, strategically, can you walk through just the mindset of accelerating the 50 exahash in the context of maybe looking at opportunity costs relative to other opportunities?\nAnd then my second question on your balance sheet, the $275 million of prepayment on the cash flow, what is that exactly related to in terms of payments? I assume it's all for the acceleration to 50 exahash. And I guess like what portion of that CapEx is already paid for? Thanks.\nDaniel Roberts\nI'll pass over to Belinda for the balance sheet question in a minute. But to address the first question around opportunity cost, I mean, we continue to have conversations with very large counterparties about the prospects of doing a deal at Childress.\nBut the reality is you've got to make a decision at some point, and the decision is right this second, the preference is to build out Bitcoin mining. The opportunity cost is comparing each pathway to another. Yes, we've received multiple offers for capacity there. But in our opinion at this stage, the prospects and the risk return proposition of building all that out at Bitcoin makes sense.\nEqually, there's still some optionality there. We haven't exercised all those minor options. We've got some time to do that. So if those contractual negotiations with other parties went a slightly different direction or improved, then, I mean, we reserve the right to change our mind and pivot. But by definition, it needs to be better than the alternative which we can control, which is building out Bitcoin mining at $30 million and having the market seemingly value that at $120 million.\nBelinda Nucifora\nThank you, Darren. Yeah. In relation to the prepayments, so we've got mining hardware prepayments of $122 million as well as on the GPUs $8.1 million. We also in our Childress new contract, we have to keep some collateral on Board, so we have some prepayments in relation to the electricity contract in Childress.\nDarren Aftahi\nGreat. Appreciate all the insights. Thank you.\nOperator\nReggie Smith, JPMorgan.\nReggie Smith\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question, or good morning rather out in Australia. You had a really interesting quote in your press release, and you actually mentioned it again during the call. Some of the effect of making sure that a deal reflected the value of your assets, strategic value of the assets, I think, was the exact quote.\nI'm not asking for a number, but I'm curious how you guys go about appraising the value of that, like how you think about it. We've tried to take some stabs at it, but I'm just curious how you think about that. And I have a follow up. Thank you.\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah. Thanks, Reggie. To be honest, it's a bit of art and science, both hand in hand. The science element is putting the numbers down and modeling out the various pathways and scenarios. You've got Bitcoin mining and then you've got various AI colocation structures that all result essentially in an NPV valuation to the business today. So that's the science.\nNotwithstanding, you've got to put assumptions into those spreadsheets, but those assumptions are informed largely by reality. When it comes to Bitcoin mining, it's CapEx, it's returns, Bitcoin price, network hash rate.\nWhen it comes to AI transactions, it's plugging in contractual terms that are under negotiation. So it's quite easy in terms of working out at any point in time what the preference might be. Notwithstanding there's assumptions that go into that, including discount rates, cost of capital, market valuation of different types of revenue streams. So all of that goes into the bucket.\nThe art element is saying, well, where are we at in the market? What are the conversations we're having with market participants all the way from hyperscalers to data centers, to the banks, to real estate companies, and triangulating all that information to try and form some sort of directional view on where the market is at.\nAnd I think it's fair to say that the market is still in transition. You've gone from the old world of effectively available capital, available data center capacity to increase the number of GPUs and meet this AI demand. All of a sudden, you seem to have hit this point in the market where hang on, we are short potentially substantial amounts of power to meet this.\nI think it's absolutely fair to say there's a transition period where every counterparty is going on their own journey around how scarce is power, how real is the current demand on the AI side? And what does this mean in terms of capacity to pay an interest in transacting in a specific valuation point.\nAnd as time goes on, what we're seeing, again, this is anecdotes, is people are now starting to realize the 1 and 0 difference between having an interconnection agreement and talking about this made up pipeline of megawatts.\nI mean, we have been in development for decades, renewable energy projects through to other infrastructure to now developing power for data centers, as we've done in IREN. It is a 1 and 0 business. You could have whatever made up pipeline of megawatts you want. But unless you get to the finish line and you get that signed connection agreement, it is worth 0, absolutely nothing.\nIn sporting terms, the analogy is going through a home and away season, undefeated, not losing the game, being the hot price favorite, you then get to the final. You have a few injuries, the weather changes, something else goes wrong and you don't win the final or you've lost. It's a 0. The season counts for nothing and you go on to the next season. It is exactly the same in this. And I think the market is now starting to realize the value of that.\nReggie Smith\nThat's good. It actually leads right into my next question. It was going to be about kind of the urgency that you were sensing. And it sounds like you're starting to get that urgency. One of the things that I've noticed is that a lot of these not a lot, but several of these big tech companies have announced long range projects that deliver in 2029, 2030, haven't really seen outside of CoreWeave a deal that's like for more immediate capacity.\nIt sounds like there's more urgency. Maybe can you talk a little bit about how conversations have changed and whether there is more urgency on the front end, post end of kind of capacity and opportunities, how that's changing? Thanks.\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, I mean, two hours ago, we got an email from $1 trillion hyperscaler that said, they weren't interested in Sweetwater, and now they are. I mean, that's one data point. And there's lots of little anecdotes along the way. I'm kind of reluctant to go into too much detail at the risk of building expectations because at the end of the day, a lot of this is outside of our control in terms of how counterparties think about value, their capacity to transact at terms that we will deem attractive.\nSo it's just a matter of working through all that, knowing that we control our own destiny, being a low-cost producer of Bitcoin and generating that strong cash on cash returns with this incredible optionality that we're super excited about around a large scale AI HPC deal that might happen.\nReggie Smith\nThat's fair. I appreciate that. Congrats on the quarter, and good luck. Thank you.\nOperator\nBrett Knoblauch, Cantor Fitzgerald.\nBrett Knoblauch\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Maybe just to start, I think a big news event that happened in the quarter was the FERC announcement. Have you seen like a material increase in demand post that announcement given they kind of used Texas assets much more favorably?\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, I mean, I've got not a lot to add as a follow up to answering the previous questions. I think, yes, like we are seeing more perceived demand coming through. But again, I'll use the sporting analogy. All these conversations are great, but unless you close a deal, it's one's and zeros.\nAnd we're just not in the business of speculating and telling everyone every step of the way how good these negotiations are because unless you get a signature on a piece of paper that delivers a transaction that delivers value for shareholders, then it's worth zero.\nIt's the same in development. It's the same in AI deals. And we can -- you can't really control the time lines of each. You've got to continue to progress things will go wrong, things will go right, but get the signature and then you've created a proper tangible value for your shareholders.\nBrett Knoblauch\nThank you. And then maybe just one more on AI cloud business. I know you guys guided for year end, it being 10% of profits. Obviously, Bitcoin has gone up a lot since then. I guess, what's the plan beyond this year for that business? And how do you view that for CapEx on GPUs relative to maybe some of the Bitcoin mining CapEx given what we've seen happening with Bitcoin over the last couple of weeks?\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, It's a great question and something we think a lot about. I think in the short term, we're probably less disposed to investing CapEx in the GPUs. And that's for two reasons. One is our current cost of capital and where we should be focusing use of funding. And I think when you look at the Bitcoin opportunity, that's very, very clear and tangible.\nGPUs, they are capital intensive. We have explored debt options. Do you want to lay in the business with debt at this point in time in the absence of having a long term contract. Again, things can change quickly, so I'm going to hedge my bets here. But sitting here right here right now with our cost of capital where it is. And also, what we're seeing is a slight weakening of demand in that market.\nIt may be attributable to this change in generations of the NVIDIA chips. We're going from the H100, H200 generation to the Blackwells being released next year, and that will be a reasonably material step up in compute. And I think it's fair to say that we're seeing end customers be a little bit cautious around that and maybe preferring shorter term contracts on the H100 and H200s, in anticipation of those new generations come out. So we just think it's prudent to just take a measured approach.\nIf tonight, we get a contract, a call for a longer term contract, and it's a big opportunity, absolutely, we're going to do it. But right here right now, it feels like it's a little bit more measured, and let's just wait and see how the next few months plays out.\nBrett Knoblauch\nAwesome. And maybe if I could just squeeze in one more. There's been a lot of news over the past couple of weeks surrounding Bitmain, and I know you guys have a big purchase order in place. I guess, are you guys concerned that those shipments could potentially not be delivered or held off at customs or just any thoughts or comments on that?\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, I mean, for six years, we've had people throw concerns around Bitmain add ups, and I'll just continue to say exactly the same thing. We have never had anything but a fantastic experience with Bitmain. The purchase process, the post market -- the aftermarket.\nIn terms of supply chain hiccups, we deal with it every day. It's the consequence of dealing with a real world business and 1 million and one moving parts, but we've had no material issues. And as I mentioned on the call, I think the last of the 31 exahash in miners will be delivered in the next few, maybe seven days.\nBrett Knoblauch\nAwesome. All appreciate it guys. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Roberts for any closing remarks.\nDaniel Roberts\nThank you, operator. Well, that rounds out our Q1 FY25 results call. We've enjoyed presenting our results, but also articulating our vision in terms of both funding side, looking at alternative structures beyond just the ATM to raise capital on potentially less dilutive terms. But importantly, the ability to invest that capital in accretive projects for our shareholders, looking at per share metrics, for example, adjusted EBITDA as outlined in our presentation and maintaining a prudent approach to capital allocation to generate those strong shareholder returns.\nIt's a consequence of long-term planning in this business to get it to this point, years of developing sites organically, years of planning and procurement of long lead items. And we feel that the mining sector as a whole as well as our business are at an inflection point. And over the next three to six months, we'll see that start to play out in even more tangible terms, and we're excited to position ourselves as a market leader in this area.\nSo thank you, everyone, for dialing in, and have a good evening.\nOperator\nThank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

While net income jumped from last year\u2019s\u00a037 cents\u00a0per share to 70 cents per share,\u00a0adjusted earnings per share amounted to 81 cents, also topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of 75 cents. Due to selling more chips, gross margin expanded to 73.5%.\nFourth Quarter Outlook\nNvidia guided for current quarter sales of about $37.5 billion plus or minus 2%. Outlook implies YoY growth of about 70%, which is a\u00a0slowdown from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when growth amounted to 265%.\nNvidia\u2019s AI dominance remains intact.\nIt\u2019s a well-known fact that Nvidia is a\u00a0primary beneficiary of the ongoing AI hype, with shares nearly tripling year to date. Blackwell shipments are in for a ramp up next year, but already in the current quarter, Nvidia is in \u201cseveral billion dollars\u201d of Blackwell revenue. Demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in the next fiscal year. Now for how long can Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance continue to soar is a different question only time is able to answer.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "whole_article": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)- the AI powerhouse of the Magnificent Seven- is down 3.18% at the time of writing. Jim Cramer sheds light on what\u2019s happening:\nSome investors say there's growing skepticism that things have peaked with Nvidia. According to Cramer, nothing is wrong. After all, we just saw the numbers, and they were great. The growing skepticism around the slowing rate of growth, increased competition, and the concern that investors are probably going to get less bang for their buck is misleading. There isn't competition from companies such as Amazon, which makes some of its chips to meet specific needs considering Nvidia doesn't have enough manufacturing capacity to meet demand.\nHere is why NVDA Stock is Declining Today According to Jim Cramer\nThat said, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the best technology so far, so much so that it \u201cwelcomes competition\u201d. The fact that Amazon makes some of its own chips, and remains Nvidia's \"happy\" customer, probably reinforces Nvidia's position as the go-to provider for premium, high-performance GPUs and AI chips, allowing the company to focus on its core strengths.\nAt the same time, many people don\u2019t know that Nvidia also has software, Cramer says. The AI darling chip maker just unveiled a groundbreaking generative AI model named Fugatto. Fugatto is designed as a versatile tool for creating and modifying sounds using text and audio prompts. Jim Cramer states that it is an AI idea factory project and that the CEO occasionally puts out ideas like these to \u201cget everyone thinking\u201d.\nJensen's strategy with Fugatto seems designed to spark big-picture thinking about Nvidia's future, showcasing innovation reminiscent of what great companies used to do. While costly initiatives like this are rarer today, mega-cap companies like Nvidia continue to deliver value.\nThis is why Jim Cramer says:\n\u201cDon\u2019t begrudge the mega caps\u2014just buy them\u201d\nOur research director shared his views on\u00a0NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout.

        "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is asking a federal appeals court to throw out a ruling in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games that would force the search giant to overhaul its Play mobile app store.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIn Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes\nIn Italy\u2019s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing\nNew York City\u2019s \u2018Living Breakwaters\u2019 Brace for Stormier Seas\nIn Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women\u2019s Sports Takes the Field\nGoogle said in a filing Wednesday that US District Judge James Donato\u2019s ruling is mistaken and asked that the outcome of the long-running litigation be set aside.\nFor one thing, Google argued, Donato should have recognized that the company competes with Apple Inc. in the smartphone market, as a different judge found when she concluded that Apple\u2019s conduct toward Epic didn\u2019t violate federal antitrust laws. The judge also erred in holding a trial with a jury last year instead of deciding himself whether Google acted anticompetitively, the company said. Google says Donato\u2019s ruling would force it to do business with rival app stores \u2014 which the company contends it is not legally required to do.\nGoogle\u2019s appeal is \u201cmeritless\u201d and relies on \u201cflawed arguments,\u201d a spokeswoman for Epic said in a statement. \u201cWe will fight to ensure that the jury\u2019s verdict and the court\u2019s injunction are upheld and Google is held to account for its anticompetitive behavior.\u201d\nA San Francisco jury concluded in December 2023 that Google violated antitrust law by blocking rival app stores through a series of revenue-sharing agreements with mobile device makers like Samsung. Following up with a fix in October, Donato ordered Google to allow developers to set up app marketplaces and offer consumers billing options other than its own payment system.\n\u201cThis case involves an extraordinary attempt by a lone competitor to use the federal judiciary to restructure the day-to-day operations of Google\u2019s app store, Google Play, and to unilaterally reshape markets with consequences for millions of non-parties,\u201dGoogle said in its filing. The jury verdict and Donato\u2019s injunction, unless reversed, \u201cwill directly undercut Google\u2019s efforts\u201d to compete against Apple, Google said.\nEpic first sued Google and Apple in August 2020, accusing them of blocking competition for rival app stores. The judge in the Apple case largely ruled against Epic, though she directed the iPhone maker to make some changes to its App Store rules. Epic and Apple are currently fighting in an Oakland federal court over whether the iPhone maker is abiding by that ruling.\nStory Continues\nDonato has temporarily put his ruling on hold. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco can extend that delay pending the outcome of Google\u2019s appeal, or force Google to make changes to its business while simultaneously seeking to overturn the ruling.\nOral arguments are scheduled on Feb. 3 at the Ninth Circuit.\n(Updates with Epic statement in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

        "whole_article": "By Mike Scarcella\n(Reuters) -Alphabet's Google asked a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday to throw out a jury verdict and a judge's order forcing it to revamp its app store Play.\nIn its first detailed argument to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Google said the trial judge made legal errors that unfairly benefited the plaintiff, \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games.\nRequiring a \"dramatic redesign\" of Google Play and its mobile-device operating system Android will hurt app developers and consumers, Google said in its court filing.\nEpic in a statement on Wednesday said Google was relying on \u201cflawed arguments\u201d that the jury rejected. \u201cThis meritless appeal is Google\u2019s desperate attempt to avoid complying with the unanimous jury decision,\u201d Epic said.\nGoogle declined to comment beyond its court filing.\nEpic\u2019s 2020 lawsuit accused Google of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and how they pay for transactions within apps. The Cary, North Carolina-based company persuaded a San Francisco jury last year that Google illegally stifled competition.\nBased on the jury's findings, U.S. District Judge James Donato ordered Google in October to let users download rival app stores within Play and make Play's app catalog available to those competitors, among other reforms.\nThe order, which would bind Google for three years, is on hold pending review in the 9th Circuit.\nGoogle told the appeals court on Wednesday that a jury should never have heard Epic's lawsuit because it sought to enjoin Google's conduct, not collect damages. It said Donato unfairly allowed Epic to tell jurors that Google and Apple are not competitors for app distribution and in-app payments.\nThe filing said Donato was wrong to issue an injunction affecting users and developers nationwide, not just Epic. Google said the order made Donato \"a central planner responsible for product design.\"\nThe 9th Circuit said it will hear oral arguments on Feb. 3, with a ruling expected later next year.\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by David Bario, Rod Nickel, David Gregorio and Jonathan Oatis)\nView Comments"

Top executives from US-based firms were in China recently to meet with Chinese business leaders amid rumors of a massive spike in tariffs on goods being imported to Washington from Beijing. Latest reports from news platform Axios contend that Donald Trump is considering the appointment of an AI czar in the White House to coordinate federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPer the report, billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly backed Trump during the 2024 election and is rumored to have a key influence over the President-elect on AI policy, will not be the AI czar. However, the report adds that Musk is nevertheless expected to be involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases related to AI. xAI, the AI startup Musk founded in 2023, recently raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. xAI is competing with OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker with a valuation of more than $157 billion.\nREAD ALSO: 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "whole_article": "It\u2019s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you\u2019re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both.\nMy advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.\nHere are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you\u2019re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.\nVideo games\nVideo games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You\u2019ll find deals on consoles including Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo\u2019s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I\u2019m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.\nA worker holds a Playstation 5 at a Best Buy store during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Nov. 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Jim Vondruska) \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nDiscounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve\u2019s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.\nHeadphones\nWhether you\u2019re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you\u2019re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.\nThe fourth generation of AirPods is showcased as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, Calif., Sept. 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo/File Photo) \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nIt\u2019s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can\u2019t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you\u2019re into.\nYou\u2019ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.\nLaptops\nIn the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You\u2019re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple\u2019s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft\u2019s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That\u2019s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.\nStory Continues\nGenerally, when you\u2019re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That\u2019s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they\u2019ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.\nTVs\nTVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don\u2019t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.\nWhen it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you\u2019re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.\nTelevisions are displayed for sale ahead of Black Friday at a Walmart Supercenter on Nov. 14, 2023, in Burbank, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mario Tama via Getty Images\nIf there\u2019s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it\u2019s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don\u2019t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you\u2019re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG\u2019s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.\nPhones and tablets\nIf you\u2019re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you\u2019re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you\u2019ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.\nTablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they\u2019re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.\nSmart speakers and streaming devices\nAmazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.\nAmazon\u2019s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku\u2019s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google\u2019s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I\u2019ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "whole_article": "Silicon Valley AI companies have a new BFF: the U.S. Department of Defense.\nThe leading companies developing generative AI technology have spun up, deepened, or started to pursue relationships with the military in recent months in some cases even revising or making exceptions to internal policies to remove roadblocks and restrictions on defense work.\nSeveral agencies within the DoD, from The Air Force to various Intelligence groups, are actively testing out use cases for AI models and tools from Meta, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral, along with tech from startups like Gladstone AI and ScaleAI, several people with knowledge of the testing told Fortune.\nIt\u2019s a remarkable turn of events for the internet companies, who until very recently treated defense work as if it were taboo, if not outright verboten. But with the cost to develop and run generative AI services already totaling hundreds of billions of dollars, and showing no signs of slowing, AI companies are feeling the pressure to show some returns on the massive investments. The DoD, with its essentially unlimited budget and long standing interest in cutting-edge technology, suddenly doesn't look so bad.\nAlthough landing a contract with Defense can be tricky, with layers of certifications to receive and strict compliance standards to follow, \u201cthe rewards are significant\u201d and the money can come in for years, Erica Brescia, a managing partner at Redpoint Ventures who focuses on AI investing, said.\n\u201cDoD contracts provide substantial annual contract values, or ACVs, and create long-term opportunities for growth and market defensibility,\u201d Brescia said.\nBrescia added that going after Defense work has recently become more socially acceptable in tech circles. Not only are company leaders looking at the hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts that defense-focused startups like Palantir and Anduril are raking in, but the \u201cchanging political landscape\u201d has made \u201cpursuing defense as a primary market segment an increasingly attractive option for companies prepared to navigate longer sales cycles and handle complex deployments.\"\nAn embrace of military work may indeed suit the political moment well, with a business-friendly Trump administration set to take office in January, and a cohort of hawkish Silicon Valley insiders, led by \u201cFirst Buddy\u201d Elon Musk, in the president elect\u2019s inner circle. Musk\u2019s mandate in his official role as co-head of the new Department of Government Efficiency is to sharply curtail spending. But few expect the Pentagon\u2019s budget to see serious cutbacks, particularly when it comes to AI at a time when the U.S. and China are locked in battle for AI supremacy.\nStory Continues\nFor now, much of the military\u2019s work with generative AI appears to be small-scale projects and tests, but the potential for generative AI tech to become a fundamental aspect of computing in the future means the relationship between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon could be huge.\nDefense uses of AI do not necessarily entail drone warfare or blowing things up. A lot of AI-specific work within the DoD is the more mundane activity that any office would gladly hand off to a capable technology. Data labeling, collection and sorting are common uses of AI within the department, as is the use of ChatGPT and Claude chatbots that most people can access online, but which require extra security when used by the DoD. Large language models could also prove handy for analyzing and searching classified information, aiding in government cybersecurity work, and providing better computer vision and autonomy for things like robotic tools, drones and tanks.\nSome tech companies do attempt to specifically avoid being involved in DoD projects that could be utilized in \u201cthe kill chain,\u201d a military term referring to the structure of an attack on an enemy, a former official within the DoD told Fortune regarding companies that win procurement contracts. Such concerns sometimes dissipate however, as millions, or billions, of dollars become available. \u201cOnce you get in, you want to expand,\u201d the person added.\nA changing set of rules\nSome tech companies, like Palantir and Anduril, have for years made Defense uses and contracts the backbone of their entire business.\nWithin Silicon Valley\u2019s established internet companies and some of its younger AI startups, however, military work was eschewed as the firms sought to recruit and retain left-leaning engineering talent. When Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, it reportedly committed never to use the startup\u2019s technology for military purposes. And in 2018 Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai faced an internal backlash over Google\u2019s participation in Project Maven, a Pentagon drone warfare effort. While Google insisted its technology was used for only \u201cnon offensive purposes\u201d such as analyzing drone video footage, the employee outcry was loud enough that Pichai cancelled a vacation to reassure staff and eventually promised Google would not develop its AI for weapons.\nWASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 13: Google CEO Sundar Pichai (2nd L) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg visit before attending the \"AI Insight Forum\" outside the Kennedy Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on September 13, 2023 in Washington, DC. Lawmakers are seeking input from business leaders in the artificial intelligence sector, and some of their most ardent opponents, for writing legislation governing the rapidly evolving technology. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGoogle\u2019s \u201cAI principles\u201d now stipulate that it will \u201cnot pursue\u2026 weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people,\u201d nor for \u201csurveillance violating internationally accepted norms.\u201d But the policy leaves plenty of wiggle room and the company has explicitly said it will not swear off working with the military entirely.\nThe story is similar at other big AI players. Meta initially prohibited its Llama model from being used in military work, as did OpenAI, while Anthropic initially built its Claude model to be \u201charmless.\u201d\u00a0 Now, all three have announced that such work with their models is fine, and they\u2019re actively pursuing such uses. Sam Altman, who co-founded OpenAI on the principle of developing AI to \u201cbenefit humanity as a whole,\u201d and who once said there were things he would \u201cnever do with the Department of Defense,\u201d has since removed any commitment to such restrictions from its usage policy.\nOne venture capitalist focused on investing in AI companies pointed to VC firm Andreessen Horowitz's \u201cAmerican Dynamism\u201d essay two years ago as a moment when avoidance of defense contracting started to shift. The essay explicitly said tech companies working on defense were working in support of America\u2019s national interest.\n\u201cExecutives started to think, \u2018Oh, ok, defending America, working with the military, is good actually,\u201d the VC said.\nThe widespread post-pandemic layoffs at tech companies has also had a chilling effect on employee protests, giving tech employers more freedom to pursue military business.\nThe DoD has already paid out close to $1 billion in official contracts to AI companies in the last two years, according to a Fortune analysis. While details of such contracts are vague, they have been awarded to companies like Morsecorp, which is focused on autonomous vehicle technology, and a subsidiary of ASGN, a management and consulting company, to develop new AI prototypes.\nNot all such contracts are made public. But any government procurement contract awarded to a major AI company would likely be worth tens of millions to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in revenue for those companies \u2014 and for their largest backers.\nOpenAI\u2019s largest investor is Microsoft, which recently said its Azure cloud service had been approved for DoD agencies to use OpenAI\u2019s AI models for information at lower levels of security clearance \u2013 something that took years of investment in specialized infrastructure to achieve. Similarly, Anthropic\u2019s largest backer is Amazon. Amazon Web Services is perhaps the single largest cloud provider to the DoD and has tens of billions of dollars worth of government contracts. For both companies, being able to add new AI services and tools to DoD offerings could prove valuable. Same goes for a company like Google, which also has secured valuable government contracts, and its Gemini AI model.\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically building the airplane while they\u2019re flying it, so it's a massive land grab,\u201d one AI executive told Fortune, referring to more tech companies suddenly eager to have their AI tools and models in the hands of the DoD.\nA \"critical\" technology for the DoD\nThe DoD defines AI among its 14 \u201ccritical technology areas,\u201d as it holds \u201ctremendous promise\u201d and is \u201cimperative to dominate future conflicts.\u201d\nAbout a year ago, the DoD officially created the Office of Strategic Capital, a new federal credit program in partnership with the Small Business Administration, in order to ensure that critical technologies like AI receive funding through direct loans. For fiscal 2024, OSC made $984 million available that it intended to hand out to 10 companies focused on things like autonomous robotics and microelectronics fabrication, which typically includes AI chip fabrication. The DoD is investing another roughly $700 million in chip fabrication and the build out of domestic semiconductor manufacturing, which is critical to the creation of AI chips.\nDespite billions in investment and no signs of that slowing down within Defense, the AI executive admitted that most AI products today are simply \u201cnot that useful yet,\u201d either for Defense or the public at large. But having them applied at scale in a government or defense environment could make them more useful, more quickly. \u201cThe military effectively created the Internet, too.\u201d ARPANET, a key technological foundation of the modern Internet, was built within the DoD, as were now common technologies like radar and GPS systems.\nAlthough a department like Defense wants useful products, it also famously sees its budget increase year after year, hitting just below $1 trillion in 2024. About half of that budget is awarded to companies that contract with the department.\n\u201cHonestly, yeah, they really love to blow money,\u201d the executive said.\nAdditional reporting by Jeremy Kahn and Sharon Goldman.\nAre you a tech company employee or someone with insight or a tip to share?

        "whole_article": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\nThe probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.\nThe FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.\nThe FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.\nMicrosoft declined to comment on Wednesday.\nCompetitors have criticized Microsoft's practices they say keep customers locked into its cloud offering, Azure. The FTC fielded such complaints last year as it examined the cloud computing market.\nNetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft's licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.\n\"Given that Microsoft is the world's largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,\" the group said.\nGoogle in September complained to the European Commission about Microsoft's practices, saying it made customers pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators, and gave them later and more limited security updates.\nThe FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.\nThe agency had already claimed jurisdiction over probes into Microsoft and OpenAI regarding competition in artificial intelligence, and started looking into Microsoft's $650 million deal with AI startup Inflection AI.\nMicrosoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators' recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.\nFacebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.\nAlphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google's trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.\nIt is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.\n\"The Trump administration was an aggressive enforcer of the antitrust laws,\" said Andre Barlow, a lawyer with Doyle Barlow & Mazard, noting it filed suits against Google and Facebook.\n\"When administrations change, the agencies do not necessarily drop ongoing investigations,\" he added, noting that \"changes in administration can lead to evolving enforcement priorities and shifts in how aggressively certain types of conduct are scrutinized.\" Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.\nIn 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; additional reporting by Chris Sanders; editing by Jonathan Oatis, Richard Chang, Alistair Bell and Sonali Paul)\nView Comments"

While business leaders are hoping that President-elect Donald Trump will usher in an era of lighter regulation, it will fall to his new FTC chair \u2014 still unnamed \u2014 to decide how to proceed with the case.\nThe FTC inquiry renews scrutiny of Microsoft for its business practices more than 25 years after the government sued the company over similar conduct involving bundling its Windows operating system and browser and unsuccessfully tried to break it up.\nA key focus of the current probe is Microsoft\u2019s bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings, according to the people familiar with the information request.\nMicrosoft\u2019s cybersecurity failings, combined with its heft as a government contractor, are seen by the FTC as an example of the company\u2019s problematic power over the market, those people said.\nStory Continues\nIn a November 2023 report, the FTC highlighted concerns that the concentrated nature of the cloud market means that \u201coutages, or other issues that degrade the service of a cloud provider, could have a cascading impact on the economy or specific sectors.\u201d\nThe CrowdStrike crash that affected millions of devices operating on Microsoft Windows systems earlier this year was itself a testament to the widespread use of the company\u2019s products and how it directly affects the global economy.\nA portion of the probe is focused on the company\u2019s practices related to security software called Microsoft Entra ID \u2014 formerly known as Azure Active Directory \u2014 which helps authenticate users logging in to cloud-based software, some of the people said.\nCompetitors have complained that Microsoft\u2019s licensing terms and bundling of software with cloud services makes it harder for rival authentication and cybersecurity companies to compete.\nCompanies such as Salesforce Inc.\u2019s Slack and Zoom Communications Inc. have said that Microsoft\u2019s practice of giving away its Teams video-conferencing software for free in a bundle with popular software products like Word and Excel is anticompetitive and makes it harder for them to compete.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

        "whole_article": "It\u2019s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you\u2019re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both.\nMy advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.\nHere are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you\u2019re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.\nVideo games\nVideo games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You\u2019ll find deals on consoles including Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo\u2019s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I\u2019m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.\nA worker holds a Playstation 5 at a Best Buy store during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Nov. 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Jim Vondruska) \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nDiscounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve\u2019s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.\nHeadphones\nWhether you\u2019re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you\u2019re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.\nThe fourth generation of AirPods is showcased as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, Calif., Sept. 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo/File Photo) \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nIt\u2019s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can\u2019t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you\u2019re into.\nYou\u2019ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.\nLaptops\nIn the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You\u2019re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple\u2019s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft\u2019s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That\u2019s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.\nStory Continues\nGenerally, when you\u2019re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That\u2019s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they\u2019ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.\nTVs\nTVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don\u2019t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.\nWhen it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you\u2019re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.\nTelevisions are displayed for sale ahead of Black Friday at a Walmart Supercenter on Nov. 14, 2023, in Burbank, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mario Tama via Getty Images\nIf there\u2019s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it\u2019s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don\u2019t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you\u2019re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG\u2019s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.\nPhones and tablets\nIf you\u2019re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you\u2019re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you\u2019ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.\nTablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they\u2019re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.\nSmart speakers and streaming devices\nAmazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.\nAmazon\u2019s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku\u2019s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google\u2019s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I\u2019ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

News agency Reuters reports that the successful debut also suggested a positive investor approach to China-based firms.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe IPO price of the stock was $13 per share but the depositary shares opened at $15 in their Nasdaq debut, per the report. Even after the stellar debut, the new company faces several challenges, the report added, including public skepticism about autonomous vehicles, data privacy concerns, and competition from companies, including Tesla which has promised to roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year. The company has said that its US operations will remain limited in scope for the foreseeable future.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. fell in early trading on Wednesday after the cybersecurity company issued a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast, disappointing investors who have been watching for signs that it has recovered from a flawed update that crashed computers around the world.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIn Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes\nIn Italy\u2019s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing\nNew York City\u2019s \u2018Living Breakwaters\u2019 Brace for Stormier Seas\nIn Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women\u2019s Sports Takes the Field\nAdjusted earnings will be 84 cents to 86 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, CrowdStrike said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts were expecting 87 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates.\nShares of CrowdStrike had fallen 5.9% at 1:33 p.m. in New York on Wednesday.\nThe report is the company\u2019s second since a flawed CrowdStrike update crashed millions of devices operating on Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Windows systems. The outage, which unfolded on July 19, disrupted a wide range of industries, including air travel, banks and health care. The company posted sales three months ago that beat expectations, a sign that investors took to mean the global IT outage wouldn\u2019t significantly affect its finances.\nThird-quarter revenue represented a bright spot in Tuesday\u2019s report. Sales for the period came to $1.01 billion, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Profit, excluding some items, was 93 cents a share, compared with the average estimate of 81 cents.\nCrowdStrike also raised its guidance for revenue for the full fiscal year, to $3.92 billion to $3.93 billion. Analysts were expecting $3.9 billion.\nThe company surpassed $4 billion in annual recurring revenue as of Oct. 31, making CrowdStrike \u201cthe fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone,\u201d Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said in the statement.\nThe company excluded roughly $26 million from its annual recurring revenue in the quarter, CrowdStrike Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere said during the earnings call. That came after a distributor in the federal space provided notice of its intention \u201cto exercise transferability rights with respect to a transaction,\u201d and CrowdStrike concluded the transaction wouldn\u2019t recur. That transaction remains in revenue in compliance with US revenue recognition rules, Podbere said.\nCrowdStrike previously agreed to a $32 million deal with Carahsoft Technology Corp., a distributor which serves as a middleman between technology companies and government agencies, for identity protection software intended for the US Internal Revenue Service. But the IRS never purchased the software, Bloomberg reported in October.\nStory Continues\nThe deal caused concern within CrowdStrike and, according to some legal and accounting experts, raised red flags.\nJeremy Fielding, a spokesperson for CrowdStrike, declined to say whether the company\u2019s comments were related to the Carahsoft deal involving the IRS. \u201cOur comments during the Q3 FY 25 earnings call speak for themselves,\u201d he said in an email. Carahsoft didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nDelta Airlines\u2019 operations were stunted for days as a result of the outage, costing the airline at least $500 million in out-of-pocket losses, according to a lawsuit it filed against CrowdStrike in October. CrowdStrike said Delta was shifting blame \u201cfrom its failure to update its antiquated IT infrastructure,\u201d in a statement at the time.\n\u201cFollowing this summer\u2019s incident as a company we were tested,\u201d Kurtz said, in a call with investors on Tuesday. \u201cWe responded with speed, care and resolve and we focused on becoming even better.\u201d\n(Updates shares in third paragraph and with additional information in 10th and 11th paragraph.

        "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Sees Strong Module Adoption, Valuation Concerns Persist: Analysts\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock is trading lower Wednesday after the company reported third-quarter financial results.\nOn Tuesday, CrowdStrike reported third-quarter revenue of $1.01 billion, up 29%, beating the\u00a0consensus estimate of $982.36 million.\u00a0The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, beating analyst estimates of $0.81. Annual recurring revenue increased 27% to $4.02 billion.\nAlso Read: Microsoft\u2019s Brad Smith Urges Trump Government to Tackle Growing Cyber Threats\nCrowdStrike expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.029 billion\u2014$1.035 billion, versus estimates of $1.03 billion. The company anticipates fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.84\u2014$0.86 versus estimates of $0.86.\nCrowdStrike now expects full-year revenue of $3.924 billion\u2014$3.931 billion, compared to estimates of $3.897 billion. The company also expects full-year EPS of $3.74\u2014$3.76, compared to estimates of $3.63.\nAnalysts rerated the stock after the quarterly print.\nWestPark Capital analyst Paul Rodriguez reiterated CrowdStrike with a Hold.\nNeedham analyst Mike Cikos maintained CrowdStrike with a Buy and raised the price target from\u00a0$360\u00a0to\u00a0$420.\nWestPark Capital: Based on the upbeat quarterly print and guidance boost, Rodriguez increased their full-year estimates to $3.93 billion in revenue and $3.76 in EPS, up from prior projections of $3.89 billion and $3.62.\nThe adoption rate of CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity modules continues to outpace its overall revenue growth of 28.5% in the third quarter. Customers using five or more modules are driving this momentum, suggesting that spending on additional modules could sustain growth above 28% for longer than anticipated. Integrating Next-Gen SIEM and artificial intelligence tools like Charlotte AI further supports this trend, fueling customer interest and module adoption.\nWhile the quarter\u2019s overall performance was robust, CrowdStrike\u2019s net new ARR declined compared to the second quarter, dropping to $217 million. The company attributed this to the July security incident and a slowdown in new customer acquisitions. Despite this, management expressed confidence in regaining growth in net new ARR as fiscal 2026 approaches.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s valuation continues to trade at a significant premium relative to its peers. The company\u2019s calendar year 2025 price-to-sales (P/S) multiple stands at 19.7x, compared to the peer average of 10.5x. Similarly, its enterprise value-to-sales (EV/Sales) multiple of 22.4x far exceeds the peer group\u2019s 9.3x. Analysts at WestPark reiterated a \u201cHold\u201d rating, citing these valuation disparities. Rodriguez expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.034 billion and EPS of $0.85.\nStory Continues\nNeedham:\u00a0CrowdStrike exceeded all guided metrics in its third quarter of fiscal year 2025, demonstrating solid execution despite industry challenges. Gross retention, which declined less than 0.5% quarter-over-quarter, highlights the company\u2019s resilience and supports management\u2019s approach to leveraging opportunities amid crises. A $500 million quarter-over-quarter increase in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reflects a surge in multi-year contracts. CrowdStrike consolidates customers onto its Falcon platform and strengthens retention through multi-module adoption, making replacements more difficult.\nManagement acknowledges reduced visibility heading into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, emphasizing headwinds in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and subscription growth. However, the company remains confident about ARR reacceleration in the second half of fiscal 2026.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon Flex offering has gained significant traction, with its total contract value (TCV) nearly doubling quarter-over-quarter to $1.3 billion, up from $700 million in the prior quarter. Flex customers, often strategic partners, spend millions of dollars with CrowdStrike, far exceeding the spending of the average customer.\nThe company\u2019s Next-Gen SIEM product continues to grow rapidly, with ARR increasing over 150% year-over-year, nearing $300 million. Adoption by over 2,000 customers underscores its appeal, with each paying approximately $150,000 annually.\nCikos raised the price target, applying a 21.3x EV/Sales multiple to fiscal 2026 revenue estimates. The updated valuation reflects increased confidence in CrowdStrike\u2019s ability to execute its customer commitment strategy and outperform its target operating model. The previous price target of $360 was based on an 18.3x EV/Sales multiple.\nCrowdStrike is poised for further growth as it continues to capitalize on multi-module adoption and innovative offerings like Falcon Flex and Next-Gen SIEM. Management\u2019s focus on ARR recovery and cost optimization positions the company for improved visibility and performance exiting fiscal 2025.\nCikos expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.034 billion and EPS of $0.86. He projects fiscal 2025 revenue of $3.901 billion and EPS of $3.62.\nPrice Action: CRWD stock is down 6.28% at $341.42 at last check Wednesday.\nAlso Read:\nMeta, OpenAI, Orange Join Forces To Build AI Models For African Languages\nPhoto via Shutterstock.\nLatest Ratings for CRWD\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nBarclays\nMaintains\nOverweight\nMar 2022\nCanaccord Genuity\nMaintains\nBuy\nMar 2022\nDeutsche Bank\nMaintains\nBuy\nView More Analyst Ratings for CRWD\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

The quarter itself was solid as CRWD beat across most of the key operating metrics we track, including billings, revenue, operating profit, and earnings.\nHowever, the quarter wasn't perfect as the company provided earnings guidance for the next quarter which fell below expectations, while revenue guidance was roughly in line.\nAdditionally, there was an unusual update during the earnings call: the removal of $26 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) from a transaction with a distributor in the Federal vertical, which is not expected to recur.\nFurthermore, management's comments during the earnings call suggest net new ARR growth is not expected to accelerate until the second half of fiscal 2026, potentially dampening near-term expectations.\nGiven the strong momentum leading up to the earnings report, the market may have been expecting a more convincing \"beat and raise\" quarter.\nThe shares closed the day at $347.71, down 4.6% from previous close.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nCrowdStrike\u2019s shares are quite volatile and have had 15 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 25.2% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit.\nKeeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.\nLastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending earlier when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results. These results could signal a shift in sentiment given CrowdStrike's popularity within the cyber security space, especially considering its cloud security capabilities.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike is up 40.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $347.65 per share, it is still trading 11.3% below its 52-week high of $392.15 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $6,176.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other AI news that broke the internet.\nOpenAI has been making headlines in the artificial intelligence realm ever since its existence, and it seems the company has something new to share almost every day. However, not all the\u00a0news surrounding the company is positive. In the latest news shared by\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0OpenAI has suspended access to its latest, highly anticipated video generation tool, Sora. This suspension followed a small group of artists who had leaked access to the tool to protest the treatment they\u2019ve been receiving at the company.\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News.\nArguing that the company used them as \u201cPR Puppets\u201d without pay, the artists created a webpage allowing anyone to make AI videos using Sora. OpenAI granted hundreds of artists free access to the video generation tool so that they could test out the new artificial intelligence video generator. However, 20 of these artists argued that the company had taken advantage of their unpaid labor. This is what the group of artists wrote on Hugging Face, an open-source repository for artificial intelligence projects.\n\u201cHundreds of artists provide unpaid labor through bug testing, feedback and experimental work for the program for a $150B valued company\u201d.\nThe artists further added that the opportunities offered in return for helping the company, such as being selected to have their Sora-created films screened, offer \u201cminimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives. The tool was public three hours before it was shut down. OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said that the company has temporarily shut down user access to Sora while it looks into the situation.\n\u201cHundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora\u2019s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards. Participation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool.\u201d\nIn other news, Axios reported that President-elect Donald Trump is considering naming an \"AI czar\" in the White House that will be coordinating federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence.

The results exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by seasonal demand and incentives introduced after a July IT outage. Operating profit and earnings per share also beat forecasts, though the operating margin fell slightly compared to the previous year.\nRBC Capital Markets on Tuesday noted that CrowdStrike management executed well following the July outage. The incident led to near-term challenges but \"should not impact customer lifetime value (LTV)\"\nHowever, CrowdStrike\u2019s fourth-quarter outlook signals a slowdown, with revenue growth expected to ease to 22.1% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share forecast to drop 11%. This reflects weaker demand for extended contracts and additional products, according to HSBC.\n\u201cGiven the sharp decline in the net new ARR in 3QFY25 and limited visibility of any near-term reacceleration in the trend, we now take a cautious approach given the potential for this weakness to translate in revenue deceleration,\u201d HSBC analyst said.\nHSBC raised its price target for CrowdStrike to $347 from $339, citing stronger earnings projections. However, the brokerage downgraded the stock, citing its high valuation, trading at 94 times estimated 2024 earnings, compared to a sector average of 37 times, which leaves less scope for further gains.\nCrowdStrike shares have rallied significantly since August when HSBC upgraded the stock following the IT outage, but growth concerns are now dampening investor sentiment.\nRelated Articles\nHSBC downgrades CrowdStrike on limited near-term growth visibility\nIsrael stocks lower at close of trade; TA 35 down 1.15%\nWhat you need to know about Adani US bribery indictment\nView Comments"

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with CRWD.\nSo, what's dragging CrowdStrike down? The aftermath of its infamous July software update, which crashed countless devices and left industriesfrom airlines to banksscrambling. Delta Airlines is still fuming, suing the company for $500 million in losses. Despite the fallout, CEO George Kurtz struck a confident tone, emphasizing CrowdStrike's resilience and its plans to accelerate Net New ARR growth in 2026. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike's Falcon platform and shiny new Next-Gen SIEM offering continue to gain traction, with analysts like TD Cowen doubling down on their $380 price target. In their view, the short-term noise isn't enough to derail the company's long-term growth story.\nWhat's the bottom line for investors? CrowdStrike's hiccup is a reality check in the fast-paced cybersecurity world, but it's far from a fatal blow. The company has set its sights on a massive $10 billion ARR milestone by 2031, and its strong Q3 numbers show it has the firepower to get there.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Maria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Maria, please go ahead.\nMaria Riley\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, including projections, and expected performance, including our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 and any assumptions for the fiscal periods beyond that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

I'd like to start today's comments by sharing three key themes that excite me about this quarter and our bright future.\nFirst, trust; the trust that customers, partners, and the market have in CrowdStrike. We grew ending ARR more than 27% year-over-year and maintained stable gross retention rates.\nSecond, widespread platform adoption. Our Falcon Flex subscription model is supercharging Falcon platform adoption. With CrowdStrike, cybersecurity consolidation is rapid and ROI is measurable. Falcon Flex is increasing both our share of wallet and enterprise real estate, furthering CrowdStrike as cybersecurity's AI native platform of record.\nAnd third, trailblazing innovation. From cloud to device, data to GenAI, application to identity, and compliance to resilience, our innovation disrupts legacy markets and creates new categories. CrowdStrike is leading the future of AI-powered cybersecurity. The themes of trust, platform adoption, and innovation guide CrowdStrike's customer obsession and continued strong execution.\nFollowing the summer's incident, as a company, we were tested. We responded with speed, care and resolve, and we focused on becoming even better, continuing to deliver industry-leading cyber protection on the Falcon platform's proven, resilient, and scaled AI native architecture. I'm encouraged by CrowdStrike's Q3 results, our first full quarter post-incident.\nFirst, ending ARR surpassed $4 billion, making CrowdStrike the fastest pure-play cybersecurity software company to achieve this reported milestone, tracking to our $10 billion ARR vision. Second, Q3 revenue surpassed $1 billion. Subscription revenue grew 31% year over year, and total revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time in company history. Third, free cash flow of $231 million or 23% of revenue, achieving a Rule of 51 on a free cash flow basis. Fourth, we closed more than 150 Falcon Flex transactions with these customers representing more than $600 million in total deal value. And fifth, more recently, we announced and closed the acquisition of Adaptive Shield, adding SaaS posture management to our portfolio, further differentiating and connecting the Falcon platform's cloud security suite and identity protection offerings.\nIn addition to these achievements, I'd like to provide some perspective on what we saw in Q3. First, Falcon customers are staying with CrowdStrike as their trusted cybersecurity platform of choice. Q3 gross retention was over 97%, down less than a 0.5 percentage point. Strength in retention was driven by the value that customers receive from the Falcon platform.\nSecond, Falcon customers are growing with us. Q3 dollar-based net retention was 115%, temporarily impacted by the incident and reflective of customers strengthening their commitment to CrowdStrike. Customers are leveraging our customer commitment package and Flex subscription model to both increase their long-term investment in CrowdStrike and increase their adoption of the Falcon platform.\nAnd third, we're seeing exceptional strength in key verticals and market segments. Healthcare saw a record quarter as providers are investing in cybersecurity's criticality based on heightened and targeted attacks.\nOur corporate sales team covering organizations below 2,500 employees had their largest quarter ever, benefiting from Falcon Flex as well as successful competitive takeouts. These successes are in the context of CrowdStrike's sustained Fortune 500 market leadership.\nOur track record of AI innovation and market-leading protection delivered on our highly resilient and cybersecurity's most performing architecture continues to resonate at scale. Our competitive win rates remain consistent to trending upwards in our total deal size for new business trended up over the last year, which we attribute to the continuous evolution of our platform solutions across cloud security, Next-Gen SIEM, identity protection, data security, and AI. Our revolutionary Falcon Flex subscription model and CrowdStrike's amplified brand recognition and favorable market sentiment from our transparent and deliberate response to the summer's incident. Through it all, we remain laser-focused on innovation, which is what drives our platform differentiation, customer stickiness, and superior protection outcomes.\nThis fall, we hosted the largest events in CrowdStrike's history, Fal.Con, our global flagship ecosystem event in Las Vegas, where 6,000 attendees joined us from more than 60 countries and 100 exhibiting ecosystem partners showcased their Falcon-integrated solutions. More recently, we hosted our inaugural Fal.Con Europe in Amsterdam, where we welcomed more than 1,700 attendees from more than 50 countries and showcased nearly 40 exhibiting ecosystem partners. These events demonstrate our continued global momentum, innovation, and the strength of the crowd, cybersecurity's ecosystem building with through and around CrowdStrike. Both events generated significant pipeline.\nAside from the platform innovations we announced, attendees were captivated by our novel subscription model, Falcon Flex. We announced the Falcon Flex model a year ago at Fal.Con 2023, and we shared at our Fal.Con 2024 Analyst Day that accounts that had adopted Falcon Flex represented more than $700 million in total deal value. We saw remarkable and accelerating Falcon Flex adoption in Q3, bolstered by our customer commitment packages with over 150 Falcon Flex deals in the quarter. Unpacking this momentum, we did two Falcon Flex deals every business day of the quarter on average. Accounts that have adopted the Falcon Flex model now represent more than $1.3 billion of total deal value, with the average Falcon Flex subscription being multiples larger than our typical contract value.\nFlex customers enjoy preferred pricing for both their contracted modules as well as other current and future modules in our portfolio, and it all comes with the flexibility of access to the products they want when they're needed. Through Flex, platform consolidation is rapid, and ROI is real. Falcon Flex also became the key delivery mechanism for our customer commitment package. We've already worked through a significant number of CCPs, with the remainder to be concluded in the upcoming quarters.\nWe see Falcon Flex deal volume accelerating. Flex has ushered in a new tempo of module adoption. We've seen customers accelerate their platform demand plans across our existing as well as new products. For example, upon announcing Adaptive Shield, we had a slew of Flex customers eagerly asking if they could use their Flex dollars for Adaptive Shield SSPM adoption. Flex enables us to rapidly commercialize innovation, whether organic or acquired, across our global sales team and partner network. Flex is already proving to be a rapid platform adoption accelerator across the customer base, giving us confidence in net new ARR acceleration in the back half of next year.\nFlex also broadens the customer audience for CrowdStrike as a whole. We've talked about cybersecurity moving from the back room to the boardroom. With Flex, we've expanded our customer stakeholder audience to include the CFO. The Flex subscription model aligns cybersecurity investment and more specifically, platform consolidation with measurable dollars and cents.\nAnd with CrowdStrike Financial Services, we bring even more tangible financial value to CFOs, deepening our relationship and relevance to this increasingly important CXO persona. As we steadily engaged with more CFOs over the past year, the feedback has been resoundingly consistent. With Falcon Flex, CFOs can see the economic benefits of platform consolidation.\nThe Flex model solves today's customer needs while seeding future growth. Flex customers demonstrate the following Falcon platform characteristics. More Falcon platform adoption. Flex customers, on average, have adopted more than nine modules, and we expect to see these numbers continue to rise.\nFaster Falcon platform adoption. All of our Flex licensing has happened in the past 12 months. In looking at this customer cohort, the amount of adoption we've seen at speed and scale is encouraging. With Flex, we have seen some customers more than double or even more than triple their module adoption.\nIncreased investment in CrowdStrike. Flex has allowed us to increase our share of wallet, consolidating multiple point product vendors. Looking at Q3, the average CrowdStrike customer spent hundreds of thousands while the average Flex customer spent multimillions. At the same time, Flex seamlessly takes cost out of cybersecurity programs, eliminating organizational and product inefficiencies from the long list of legacy disjointed point product cybersecurity tools.\nAlongside Falcon Flex's success and larger transactions overall was the announcement of CrowdStrike Financial Services, CFS, our financing arm that aligns customer cybersecurity and cash flow objectives. CFS gives customers financial flexibility while driving larger deals, faster deal cycles, and longer subscription duration.\nIn our first quarter of CFS, we closed more than $49 million in deal value, including two eight-figure deals. Here are a few Flex noteworthy wins: an 8-figure expansion deal with a Fortune 500 travel leader who sought CCP pricing to do more with CrowdStrike, growing their spend with us by over $15 million. Despite impact from the summer's incident, our response and partner-assisted recovery solidified trust and inspired increased Falcon investment from the Board to executives to the cybersecurity team. Through Flex, this customer expanded their Falcon plan to include Falcon Cloud Security, bio-integrity monitoring, firewall management, and data protection going from 8 modules to 14 modules in a single Flex transaction.\nAn eight-figure new logo land with a Global 2000 technology manufacturer, where Falcon displaced legacy AV, a legacy SIEM, and a legacy vulnerability management product. Through Flex, the customer was able to go all in on the Falcon platform for EDR, Next-Gen SIEM, Falcon Complete MDR, Identity Protection, Threat Intelligence, and Exposure Management, consolidating four vendors in this initial Flex purchase. Consolidation goals achieved, protection outcomes delivered, and platform adoption success.\nClosing off on Falcon Flex, customers are spending more, entering into longer subscription terms and taking the opportunity to achieve their consolidation objectives faster. We expect to see faster and larger ARR uplift over time through the Falcon Flex model, aligning the industry's leading cybersecurity platform with our revolutionary subscription model is a lightning in a bottle combination for current and future growth.\nNext, I'd like to share our innovation progress where we're trailblazing new cybersecurity outcomes across cloud security, identity protection, and Next-Gen SIEM in addition to our data, AI, and IT investments. We're incredibly excited by the innovation taking place within both our cloud and identity businesses.\nWe recently announced the acquisition of Adaptive Shield, a leading vendor in the fast-growing SaaS security posture management, or SSPM market. Adaptive Shield builds on our AI leadership, giving us unmatched coverage of the rapidly growing SaaS threat plane, with more than 150 native integrations across everything from CRM tools to cloud backup to workforce productivity.\nMore importantly, Adaptive Shield slots in perfectly as a complement to both our cloud and identity security businesses with multiple integrations already completed, another example of CrowdStrike charting the course ahead of the market. Within Cloud Security, the combination of adaptive field with our core Falcon Cloud Security functionality gives us the broadest cloud security ecosystem coverage. This move builds on both our organic developments as well as the recent acquisition of Bionic and Flow.\nWith Adaptive Shield, CrowdStrike is the only platform delivering an end-to-end cloud security suite with runtime at the center of everything from code data and now SaaS to runtime. And with Adaptive Shield, we further enhanced our ability to secure the enterprise's prolific adoption of AI. CrowdStrike pioneered the use of AI for security through our on-sensor model and threat graph and pioneered the use of GenAI for improving SOC analyst workflows through Charlotte AI.\nWe've also recently introduced bespoke services for AI security, pen testing AI models to reduce exposure, weaknesses, and data leakage risk. At CrowdStrike, we deliver both AI for security and security for AI.\nWhile our recently launched AI SPM offering enables organizations to secure the adoption of AI within their cloud infrastructure, Adaptive Shield works by protecting the enterprise from GenAI risk. As more employees look to leverage GenAI tools for their everyday workflows, data leakage, data theft, and adversary espionage are on the rise. The combination of AI SPM and Adaptive Shield gives our customers more holistic AI protection from code to runtime and now to the end user.\nAI-powered cloud security wins in the quarter include, a unicorn AI leader that took their Falcon deployment to the next level in an eight-figure Falcon Cloud Security expansion deal. Growing their cloud security footprint rapidly over the last few years, the combination of workload protection as well as our CSPM, CIEM, and more recently, our Posture Management for AI, data, and applications solidified our position as this company's cloud security consolidator of choice. Once again, this customer set a new largest transaction record for our corporate sales team.\nA [Fortune 50] retailer expanded in an eight-figure deployment of Falcon Cloud Security. Seeing the difference that runtime protection makes, we seamlessly expanded from being the company's EDR vendor of choice to its cybersecurity platform of record for the cloud and AI era.\nFalcon Cloud Security goes well beyond narrow CSPM use cases and associated alert fatigue. Falcon completes CVR securing their expansive multi-cloud and hybrid cloud estate, the easy and frictionless choice.\nWithin identity protection, Adaptive Shield builds on our continued organic innovation. Since launching our identity prediction module, CrowdStrike has always had best-in-class coverage of active directory environments. However, with Adaptive Shield, CrowdStrike is now capable of securing identity where potentially malicious user behavior takes place. Whether on-device, in the cloud, or in a SaaS application, CrowdStrike offers holistic protection across critical identity touch points. And we're just getting started.\nWe recently announced support of Microsoft Entra ID, formerly Azure Active Directory, making CrowdStrike capable of securing the rapidly emerging identity threat vector for all Microsoft customers from highly regulated enterprises to born-in-the-cloud AI disruptors. Here's a representative identity win from the quarter. A Fortune 500 new logo in the travel and hospitality space saw the difference that our robust identity protection technology makes in stopping prolific actors. Replacing a patchwork of legacy technologies, we were able to showcase the differentiation of Falcon identity protection to land a sizable platform win across identity, EDR, Next-Gen SIEM, and threat intelligence.\nFalcon Next-Gen SIEM has been a game changer, and we're experiencing a hypergrowth inflection point. While we provide more granular detail during our Q2 and Q4 earnings calls, Next-Gen SIEM performed exceptionally well this quarter, with net new ARR growth accelerating to over 150% year over year at multi-hundred million dollar scale.\nWith 30 million Fusion SOAR workflows per week and over 2,000 Next-Gen SIEM customers, Falcon Next-Gen SIEM is quickly becoming our customers' data foundation. We've introduced several new groundbreaking features. AI-generated parcels take the guesswork and learning curve out of integrating third-party data sources into Next-Gen SIEM. AI Investigator accelerates query speed and flattens analyst learning curves through a GenAI-powered query builder, and AI Alert Triage automates end-to-end workflows at the speed of AI. Yet the core differentiation for Next-Gen SIEM remains unchanged, unmatched speed and scalability and an unmatched cost with Falcon Data natively resident from the start. This is why more and more customers are ditching their legacy SIEM vendors for CrowdStrike.\nNext-Gen SIEM customer wins in the quarter include an eight-figure major national health care provider that replaced a competing SIEM, expanding their Falcon usage with Next-Gen SIEM. Using CrowdStrike Financial Services, we were able to close a sizable seven-year deal.\nWorking across the customer C-suite, specifically with the CFO, we aligned cybersecurity innovation with cost reduction, platform consolidation with protection outcomes, and payment terms with ROI, delivering eight figures of customer business value benefits within three years of purchase. CrowdStrike is now firmly rooted as the organization's cybersecurity data platform of choice.\nA near eight-figure expansion deal with a Fortune 500 manufacturing giant, where we replaced a hyperscaler SIEM in a competitive deal against several SIEM vendors. Multiple consoles and a lack of security workflows created inefficiencies for this customer. The transaction was also an opportune time to grow with CrowdStrike, purchasing Charlotte AI and Threat Intelligence as SIEM enhancements as well as other modules such as Data Protection.\nHaving a single console in a single platform continues to differentiate Falcon customer experiences. All the while, our innovation investments continue to grow and show promise.\nLet me first talk about CrowdStrike's AI innovation and the progress we're making with Charlotte, our AI agent. Much like peer companies ServiceNow and Salesforce, we're using advanced AI models to deliver proactive and autonomous outcomes. Charlotte AI is capable of taking actions based upon observed data to achieve specific security goals.\nGoing well beyond the capabilities of a chatbot, Charlotte addresses a critical skills gap in human capital need by automating detection triage, traditionally a labor-intensive process for all security personnel. Charlotte AI detection triage announced that Falcon eliminates a significant amount of routine EDR investigation tasks. Charlotte continues to evolve through customer use, leveraging the Falcon platform's unique data advantage, CrowdStrike's highly curated threat data and high-fidelity security events. We had a record triple-digit growth quarter for Charlotte AI, fueled by customer demand for increased time savings and workflow automation.\nData Security with our largest Data Security quarter to date, driven by customer desire to replace legacy DLP without additional overhead. Falcon for IT. We're seeing continued demand from large enterprises seeking to unify security and IT management while eliminating vendors to further their consolidation objectives.\nThe Falcon platform continues to resonate at scale with partners of all types. In Q3, nearly 70% of our new subscription business was partner-sourced, illustrating the commitment and stickiness of our winning partner ecosystem. Our GSI partners are building Next-Gen SIEM practices across the world. Our hyperscaler partners are seeing CrowdStrike records, with AWS Marketplace transaction values up more than 100% year over year as organizations pursue their Falcon Flex licensing on their hyperscaler platforms of choice.\nOur technology partners continue to win with us. We announced a strategic partnership with Fortinet, the global firewall market share leader by shipments. We're already seeing Fortinet take us into their accounts, and we're doing the same.\nHelping us reach the long tail of SMBs, our MSSP business continues to expand at a rapid triple-digit pace through The Pax8 Marketplace, NinjaOne, and leading MSPs who contract with CrowdStrike.\nAnd lastly, in Q3, SHI became our fourth billion-dollar partner, bringing the Falcon platform to their customers. This is highlighted by their success bringing Next-Gen SIEM, Cloud Security, Identity Protection, and Falcon Complete MDR to market. We ended Q3 with deal registrations up year over year, a marked turnaround from incident levels. Our business results speak to the conviction partners have in the Falcon platform and the multi-TAM transformation opportunity that only CrowdStrike offers.\nOur continued market and technology leadership isn't only recognized by customers and partners, it is also lauded by industry analysts. Several recent noteworthy accolades include, one, the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection. Even after the summer, CrowdStrike was placed highest for ability to execute and furthest provision in the whole Magic Quadrant, ahead of all competitors in every dimension.\nTwo, in Gartner's critical capabilities, CrowdStrike earned the highest scores, ahead of all vendors evaluated in both core endpoint protection and managed security services for the second year in a row.\nThree, Falcon Cloud Security was recognized as a frost radar leader in cloud workload protection platforms for the second consecutive year, ahead of CSPM startups and industry peers.\nFour, Attack Surface Management was positioned as a leader in the Q3 2024 Forrester Wave, showcasing our emergence in a new market category with significant TAM opportunity.\nAnd five, Falcon Next-Gen SIEM was named a major player in the latest SIEM IDC MarketScape, underscoring our success displacing the legacy SIEMs.\nIn closing, customers and partners remain firmly committed to CrowdStrike as their cybersecurity platform of record. Our Flex licensing model delivers accelerated platform adoption, and Falcon innovation isn't stopping. These themes set up a Q4 of continued progress in an upcoming year of back-half net new ARR acceleration growth.\nOur future is bright. A vivid example that struck me this past quarter is the scale and consistency at which we're doing substantial transactions. We set a new record of million-dollar-plus transactions, closing more than 260 this quarter equating to an average of four more million-dollar-plus deals every business day. Results like these demonstrate the customer conviction, partner commitment, and market sentiment for CrowdStrike as cybersecurity's innovation leader and a security platform of record.\nBefore turning the call over to Burt, I would like to thank all CrowdStrikers for their dedication to our mission of stopping breaches, our partners for helping us win and continuing to build large businesses with us, and, of course, our customers for their commitment and unwavering trust in CrowdStrike.\nI'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Burt Podbere.\nBurt Podbere\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. We delivered third-quarter results above our stated expectations across all guided metrics. Our third-quarter results reflect our focused execution and relentless customer-first mindset, which drove a strong finish and quarter-over-quarter increase in pipeline despite continued headwinds and a pause in pipeline generation at the start of the quarter following July 19.\nIn Q3, ending ARR surpassed the $4 billion milestone, growing 27% year over year to reach $4.02 billion, of which $153 million was net new added in the quarter. As expected, the July 19 incident resulted in near-term headwinds to net new ARR as we experienced extended sales cycles with both existing and prospective customers and one-time incentives offered through our customer commitment packages, which resulted in increased contraction and muted upsell rates.\nSales cycles increased by approximately 15% year over year within enterprise accounts. As of last Friday, we closed more than half of the push deals that had remained open at the time of our Q2 call. While we normally recognize ARR contraction in the quarter a transaction is subject to renew, in Q3 FY 2025, we excluded approximately $26 million from ARR after a distributor in the federal space provided notice of its intention to exercise transferability rights with respect to a transaction, and we concluded that the transaction would not recur.\nIn compliance with US GAAP revenue recognition rules, this transaction remains in revenue. In total, our Q3 dollar-based gross retention rate of over 97% held resilient, with less than 0.5 percentage point decrease from Q2's strong performance. And given the July 19 incident, we are also pleased with our Q3 dollar-based net retention rate of 115% as customers embraced our customer commitment packages and more of the Falcon platform. We estimate that customer commitment packages impacted net new ARR by approximately $25 million in Q3 within our expectations.\nThe majority of deal value that closed in the quarter with customer commitment packages included additional product or Flex dollars rather than extended time and professional services. That, coupled with the timing and linearity of in-quarter Q3 revenue, limited the impact to Q3 revenue and contributed to the strong revenue beat in the quarter.\nOur customer commitment packages are helping fuel an increase in platform and module adoption. Subscription customers with five, six, and seven or more modules grew to 66%, 47%, and 31% of subscription customers, respectively. Notably, we reached a new milestone for module adoption in the quarter as customers with eight or more modules grew to 20% of subscription customers. This momentum in increased module adoption and our Falcon Flex program gives us confidence in our customer commitment strategy and ability to reaccelerate net new ARR growth starting in the back half of fiscal year 2026.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 29% over Q3 of last year to reach $1.01 billion, ahead of our expectations and our first quarter exceeding the $1 billion milestone. Subscription revenue grew 31% over Q3 of last year to reach $962.7 million, and professional services revenue was $47.4 million. Total gross margin of 78% was flat year over year, and subscription gross margin remained strong at 80% of revenue. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $591.7 million compared to $436.1 million in the prior year.\nAs outlined in our last earnings call, we continue to invest in our FY 2025 plan and bolstered our R&D, quality assurance, and customer support programs. In the third quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 11% year over year to $194.9 million and operating margin was 19%. GAAP net loss attributable to CrowdStrike was $16.8 million, primarily due to $33.9 million in expenses related to the July 19 incident. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike grew 18% to $234.3 million or $0.93 on a diluted per share basis.\nCash and cash equivalents grew to $4.26 billion. Free cash flow was $230.6 million or 23% of revenue and was impacted by the July 19 incident as well as planned investments in data center and workload optimization, R&D, and sales and marketing. Additionally, the $49 million in deals financed through CrowdStrike Financial Services had a de minimis impact to Q3 free cash flow as expected.\nTurning to our outlook. We are encouraged by our continued high-dollar-based gross retention rate, success of our customer commitment packages with customers opting for more product or Flex dollars, the continued strong adoption of the Falcon platform and growing module adoption rates, and quarter-over-quarter growth in pipeline. All of these positive indicators give us confidence in our ability to reaccelerate net new ARR growth starting in the back half of FY 2026.\nHowever, in the near term, visibility remains limited, given the headwinds related to the July 19 incident that we outlined last quarter, including the delay of the vast majority of outbound pipeline generation activities for a few weeks following the July 19 incident, extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, and continued deployment of customer commitment packages resulting in muted upsell rates and potentially higher-than-typical levels of contraction.\nWhile in Q3, customers strongly embraced the additional modules and Flex options associated with our customer commitment packages rather than additional time, it is still too early to determine if that trend will remain the same in Q4. Recognizing our continued reduced visibility, we are maintaining our estimated impact of approximately $30 million to both net new ARR and subscription revenue in Q4 from our customer commitment packages.\nAs discussed last quarter, the aforementioned headwinds are additive to the expected quantified impact. While we do not typically comment on analyst estimates, we wanted to note that the vast majority of analysts are modeling Q3 to Q4 net new ARR seasonality well above historical levels. We request that you keep historical sequential seasonality in mind when updating your models.\nAdditionally, as we discussed last quarter, the modeling of ARR and subscription revenue should be decoupled in the short term, given the customer commitment packages. Our Fal.Con 2024 investor presentation has additional details on this dynamic.\nMoving beyond the top line, we expect to incur additional GAAP tax expense in Q4 of approximately $58 million due to previous acquisitions. Additionally, we closed our acquisition of Adaptive Shield last week, which is expected to have a $0.01 to $0.02 impact to non-GAAP EPS as reflected in our Q4 guidance.\nMoving to cash, we expect Q4 free cash flow to reflect a significantly more pronounced July 19 impact in comparison to Q3. This is due to collections impacted by increased flexible payment terms under customer commitment packages for deals closed in Q3, the incremental sales compensation expenses and the timing and size of G&A costs, all relating to July 19.\nAs a result, we do not expect to see sequential free cash flow margin leverage in Q4. We continue to expect CrowdStrike Financial Services to have a de minimis impact to free cash flow in Q4. We remain committed to achieving $10 billion in ending ARR by the end of fiscal year 2031 and achieving our target non-GAAP operating model on an annual basis by fiscal year 2029, which includes a free cash flow margin target between 34% and 38%.\nMoving to our guidance. For the fourth quarter of FY 2025, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $1,028.7 million to $1,035.4 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 22%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $184.0 million to $189.0 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $210.9 million to $215.8 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.84 to $0.86, utilizing a weighted average share count of approximately 252 million shares on a diluted basis. For the full fiscal year 2025, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,923.8 million to $3,930.5 million, reflecting a growth rate of 28% to 29% over the prior fiscal year.\nNon-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $804.4 million and $809.4 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $937.5 million and $942.6 million. Utilizing approximately 251 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.74 to $3.76.\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Saket Kalia. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\nMaria Riley\nSaket, are you there? Operator, is he there? If not, please go to the next question. Okay, great.\nOperator\nNot a problem. We will move forward with the next question.\nMaria Riley\nNo, wait. He's there.\nSaket Kalia\nHey, guys. Can you hear me?\nMaria Riley\nYeah. Hi, Saket. Thank you.\nSaket Kalia\nThere we go. Sorry about that. Absolutely. So George, maybe for you, lots of helpful detail. I wanted to start, sort out just zooming out a little bit. You spend a lot of time with customers. I guess the question is, what are they telling you about some of the puts and takes to security spending next year? I mean, you've got plenty of tailwinds like lower interest rates and potentially a better macro but also different policies out of the federal government. So how do you think about those factors as you maybe gauge the health of security spending next year?\nGeorge Kurtz\nSure. Thanks, Saket. I think if you're -- and everyone probably is following some of the news, you'd see the security environment is only getting worse. E-crime groups have been prolific, and we continue to see ransomware and extortion where be very, very successful for big dollars.\nSo from a security environment perspective, customers want the best products, want the best platform. They want something that's going to stop the breach and be most effective, that hasn't changed. Two, they want to consolidate; this hasn't changed either. This complexity normally breeds inconsistencies and seams in protection gaps within multiple technologies, so a broad platform approach is something that aids in stopping the breach. And they want to drive down their overall operational cost, and that hasn't changed and I don't think that is going to change based upon my interactions with companies in the coming year.\nSo we'll see how it all unfolds, but we're certainly encouraged by the forward-looking environment based upon just what we see. And companies, whether it's the threat environment or regulatory pressures, they're going to have to spend money on the best technologies. And we're certainly going to be there to be able to capitalize on it.\nSaket Kalia\nVery helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nHamza Fodderwala, Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala\nGreat. Can you hear me?\nGeorge Kurtz\nYes.\nHamza Fodderwala\nGood evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Burt, maybe for you just to comment on the ARR or net new ARR seasonality that you spoke about for Q4. If I look at the last few years, last Q4, we had a pretty strong budget flush, pretty strong Q4 overall. The year before that, I think it was a bit more muted. When you speak on Q4 net new ARR seasonality this year, is that assuming that budget flush that we saw a year ago or something similar to what we saw maybe two years ago? Thank you.\nBurt Podbere\nHi, Hamza. Thanks for your question. So when we think about Q4, I talked about some of the things that impact us and certainly, one of them is the limited visibility that we have. It's just too early to tell. We have a lot of things that are going to be in play for Q4, the continued CCP packages that we have. And with that, it just limits our visibility in terms of how we think about Q4. Generally, it is, of course, our biggest quarter, and we have the most that's subject to renewal but we still need to sell through it.\nOperator\nBrian Essex, JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex\nHi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. George, great to see the durability of the growth retention rates, particularly in light of the event of July 19. Is there anything that you can call out in terms of trends that you're seeing as you're speaking with customers, both on the churn side? Like, what tend to be some of the themes of customers that are churning off?\nAnd then also on the better adoption side, what are some of the more durable factors that are leading to better adoption rates on the platform? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz\nWell, thank you, and good question. As you probably know, I spend a lot of my time with the larger customers and really haven't had a lot of conversations around churn. And the conversations that I have had have been recognition that we do have the best technology in the market and a recognition of how we handled the July 19 outage. And I think that's an area where we turned prices into a customer trust building opportunity. And of course, we're trying to make it right for customers.\nSo from my perspective, I certainly haven't seen a lot in the larger to midsized deals. In fact, our corporate business, as I called out, had the best quarter ever. So from a churn perspective, you could see some churn in the very small MSP space. It's an area where it really doesn't matter the vendor. It's easy to kind of move in and out. But I'm encouraged by the conversations that I'm having with our largest customers and a reflection on the fact that they realize that we have the best tech in the industry and the ability to stop breaches and drive down their overall operational cost from a platform perspective.\nNext.\nOperator\nPatrick Colville, Scotiabank.\nPatrick Colville\nHey, team. Thank you so much for taking my question. I guess I want to ask George. I mean, 2024 was the year of Copilots, including Charlotte AI. In your prepared remarks, George, you talked about kind of Detection Triage. I guess the topic du jour amongst the investment community is agentic AI. You didn't mention that in your prepared remarks. So I guess, how is CrowdStrike thinking about internal usage of agentic AI or possibly the ability for agentic AI to help CrowdStrike's customers? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurtz\nThanks, Patrick. And I covered that a bit in the prepared remarks and the fact that Charlotte AI was built to be something more than a Copilot. We probably built it before it even had a term, which is now agentic AI. And the whole idea with Charlotte AI was not only to collective wisdom of CrowdStrike over the last decade, all of our threat indicators, all of the sort of workflows that we've created around triaging events, and answer those questions but go beyond that to actually do work on behalf of customers. So today, and it's the way we built it, it actually will do work on behalf of customers, and that's the entire piece of SOC transformation.\nAnd just to give you an example, we talked about Alert Triage and some of those things in the prepared remarks, but we had a customer that would take four days to create what's called a sit rep, a situational report and that manually, they would create these reports, and now takes them one hour. So that's the level of efficiency that we're seeing with Charlotte. And you couldn't do that if it was just a chatbot. It's the agentic nature of Charlotte AI, and that's what we're delivering to customers.\nInternally, we're certainly leveraging a lot of what our great partners put together, whether that's Salesforce or ServiceNow or what have you. There's many technologies that we leverage, including many of the GenAI technologies to help us create greater efficiencies.\nOperator\nTal Liani, Bank of America.\nTal Liani\nHello. Thank you. So Burt, I know you're cautious but your net new ARR was not bad at 150, given that we had 250 before the outage. It's -- there are some people expect it even to be negative. And I hear you now on 4Q cautious again. And the question is what are the -- how are the factors changing in 4Q? Meaning, you said that you have a big renewal quarter. Outside of the renewal or can you speak about, for example, what was your experience with renewals this past quarter? I would have thought that 4Q would be better than 3Q just because we don't have an outage in the middle, so it eliminates these 10 days or 14 days that people were kind of unclear about what's happening. So I want to understand how 4Q changes and why wouldn't 4Q be actually better than 3Q. Thanks.\nBurt Podbere\nThanks, Tal. So although true that we are a little further from sun, we're still kind of fighting through the incident. But I'll give you some additional color in terms of the things that I went through when I thought about Q4. And I talked a little bit about limited visibility with Hamza. So one is when we think about what happened shortly after the incident, the lay of the vast majority of our outbound pipeline-generating activities, for the first few weeks following the incident, that certainly has an impact for Q4. So that's one.\nI think we're still going to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers. I think customers have additional scrutiny, additional layers, approvals, all that sort of thing. And I think we're going to continue to deploy customer commitment packages. This is going to result in muted upsell rates and potentially higher-than-typical levels of contraction. You factor all those things together, and I still want to be mindful of those things taking place and the activities that the sales team has to do to sell through all of that.\nWell, I had a couple of other things. While in Q3, customers strongly embraced the additional modules and Flex options associated with CCPs, rather than additional time, it is still too early to determine if that trend will remain the same for Q4. I want to give caution in terms of what customers are going to choose with respect to CCP. We don't know yet. We had one quarter, and so that really impacts our ability to really understand what's going to happen in the dynamics in Q4.\nAnd then finally, I do want to talk about the fact that we are maintaining our estimated impact of approximately $30 million to both net new ARR and subscription revenue in Q4 from our customer commitment packages. And remember, the two of those, you have to decouple both of them. And we talked about that last quarter, and we talked about it in our Fal.Con 2024 investor presentation, and it has the details on that dynamic.\nOperator\nJoel Fishbein, Truist.\nJoel Fishbein\nThanks for taking the question. I guess one for Burt. Burt, on the Falcon Flex, obviously, it sounded like it was ahead of your guys' expectations in terms of adoption. The one thing that I didn't get, what from you is the average deal term or duration of those deals, that would be really helpful. Really appreciate it.\nBurt Podbere\nHey, Joel. Thanks for the catch. We didn't give a specific number but we did see deals being slightly longer, and so that excites us for sure.\nOperator\nGabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Burt, I wanted to connect the dots here on what you're saying about Falcon Flex and the potential for reacceleration next year. Is there anything you're seeing in the Falcon Flex cohorts post July 19 versus this before July 19 in terms of average ARR increases, average deal sizes, et cetera, that would lead you to think that the conversion rates for the upsell routes on today's Falcon Flex deals could look different a year from now versus the baseline that you already have?\nBurt Podbere\nHi, Gabriela. So I talked a little bit about the fact that we've seen deals being slightly larger, which is great. Still too early to tell what's going to happen as these renewals come due. But certainly, it goes back to how we already thought about this and how we talked about it last quarter with respect to seeding the future. And having the ability to do upsell on the renewal and getting customers to enjoy us more and wanting to use more. We had over 150 Falcon Flex deals and that's a great number.\nAnd then, I think that we had accounts -- at the end of the day, the accounts have adopted the Falcon Flex model now represent more than $1.3 billion of total deal value, and in there with an average Falcon Flex subscription being multiples larger than our typical contract value. So those are important takeaways. Flex customers, on average, have adopted more than nine modules. So if you factor all those things together, we get encouraged again by reacceleration in the back half of next year.\nOperator\nMatt Hedberg, RBC.\nMatt Hedberg\nThanks, guys. Can you hear me okay?\nGeorge Kurtz\nYeah.\nMatt Hedberg\nYeah, great. George, a question for you. You talked about Next-Gen SIEM in the prepared remarks. It's really good to hear the growth that you're seeing there. I guess I'm wondering, what are you seeing really from a competitive perspective? I think we all are thinking that there's a good opportunity there, but just wondering about that. And then what are pushing some customers to change, I guess, is ultimately the question?\nGeorge Kurtz\nYeah. I think when you look at the Next-Gen SIEM market, and one of the things that we really, again, helped, I would say, create and pioneer, it's greater efficiencies, speed and scalability, which is just not available in legacy products. The fact that we can basically give immediate outcomes because it's all built into our system, right? This is a concept of first-party data, which comes from CrowdStrike third-party data. Well, we've created an incredible ecosystem and opened up the platform now where these workflows can be done within the Falcon platform and then aided by Charlotte AI.\nSo customers are putting more and more data into the technologies. And they're seeing the performance and the speed and maybe, more importantly, the cost differences between some of the legacy providers that are out there.\nAnd we go into a POV and we go through all of the stats, and people kind of scratch their heads sometime to go, okay, prove it, and then when we get through it, they're like, we've never seen anything this fast or performant or get the outcome that we're looking for. So we're really excited about it and keep broadening the ecosystem there. And I think it represents a tremendous opportunity for us in the short, medium and long term. It's a huge business, Next-Gen SIEM and we're going to be front and center in it.\nOperator\nAndy Nowinski, Wells Fargo.\nAndy Nowinski\nOkay, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. First off, congrats on getting through what was likely your most challenging quarter you probably had in company history. So I wanted to ask a question again on Falcon Flex. I know you booked $1.3 billion in deals and you talked about how it's supercharging the adoption of your platform. But if I'm thinking about it correctly, I would think it's also supercharging your customer retention rates because as customers deploy more modules, like you said, it seems like it makes it increasingly difficult to leave the platform. So I guess, first, am I thinking about that correctly in terms of customer retention? And are you factoring in any improvement to ARR due to Falcon Flex going forward?\nGeorge Kurtz\nWell, I'll take the first part, and Burt, you can feel free to chime in. It absolutely makes the platform stickier. The more modules, we know this is a fact, more modules customers use, the stickier the platform becomes. And you're talking 9, 10, we've talked about, I think, 1 to 14. That's incredibly sticky because a lot of processes are built around that. So from our perspective, it is a great opportunity for customers and for us they get a better value.\nAnd again, what we're seeing is, in general, we're seeing customers adopt more and faster, right, which if they adopt more and faster, that gives us the opportunity to go back in and top up those Falcon Flex pool. So we are excited about the licensing mechanism. Customers are, we talked about Adaptive Shield. The day we announced that, we were at Fal.Con Europe and a customer said, okay, if I'm a Falcon Flex customer, can I use it day one when it closes? And we're like, yes, since we closed the deal and we get it skewed up, you'll be able to use it, which, again, removes a lot of friction and aids in the adoption.\nSo anything to add, Burt?\nBurt Podbere\nYes. Just I think all the things that George said gives us more confidence in our ability to reaccelerate in the back half of next year.\nOperator\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz\nOkay, great. Thank you very much. Your RPO growth accelerated quite strongly this quarter and your RPO bookings growth, which at least by our estimates, is greater than 60%, that appears to be the highest we've seen since fiscal 2022.\nNow, clearly, the customer commitment packages and Flex had a significant impact here. And so I guess with that in mind, it would just be helpful, Burt, to get your perspective on, A, how the CRPO performance was, and B, how we should generally be thinking about what these strong bookings might mean for revenue recognition and ARR when we look down the road? Thanks.\nBurt Podbere\nThanks, Gregg. So I think ultimately, when we think about our view and we think about the increase, it does talk to just longer deals, longer duration. I think all the things that we've talked about, whether it's CCP, whether it's CrowdStrike Financial Services, they all add in terms of helping customers do more with us for longer periods of time, and that's reflected in our RPO number.\nOperator\nJohn DiFucci, Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci\nThanks for taking my question. Burt, listen, you've always been really clear, which has, I think, been great for investors and great for the stock, too. And ARR is always and revenue have always been great, had a great connection over time. Can you -- and I know there's some small print, but I don't -- can you explain to us what's making this coupling diverge? And I don't know, hopefully, it's not a long explanation. It's probably why you haven't said it. But can you do that? Can you give us, like even if it's temporary here because I don't want to see -- my model works great for you and you're the first ones to do this. And it's really clear and you put it right out there for everybody to see. But why is that going to diverge? Why could it diverge in the short term?\nBurt Podbere\nSo thanks, John. So number one, for all your comments. I appreciate all your comments that you made. So first, big picture, it's temporary. The divergence is temporary. And I think it just talks to when you have a CCP and out of the gate, there is, for example, extended time, it's offered, there's going to be a more immediate hit on ARR than revenue. It's going to lag. And so that's how we think about it and that's how I've tried to be clear on explaining it. Hopefully, that helps, John.\nOperator\nThank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to George Kurtz for closing remarks.\nGeorge Kurtz\nOkay. Thank you, operator. So thank you all for your time today. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to seeing you at our upcoming investor events.\nView Comments"

We hope to see some of you at these events. Finally, our second quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period will begin on January 18.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nStory Continues\nRajiv Ramaswami\nThank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We are happy to report first-quarter results that came in ahead of our guidance. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership, our TCO.\nTaking a closer look at the first quarter, we exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $591 million. We grew our ARR 18% year over year to $1.966 billion. We also saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in new logos and solid free cash flow generation.\nOur largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to organizations that are looking to modernize their IT footprint, including adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models and modern applications while also managing through disruption from industry M&A.\nOne of our largest wins of the quarter was a full stack expansion with a global provider of IT consulting services based in the APAC region. This existing Nutanix customer expanded with us by shifting more workloads to our cloud platform, and adding additional components of our portfolio, enabling them to increase their automation and self-service capabilities while also reducing their exposure to their other incumbent infrastructure provider. This expansion was also aimed at strengthening their go-to-market practice with Nutanix in the areas of generating AI, modern applications, and competitive migrations.\nAnother notable win in Q1 was a significant expansion with a North American-based Fortune 100 provider of food services and products. This customer was looking to implement a hybrid multi-cloud environment with the intent of running more of their workloads in the public cloud and lowering their total cost of ownership while also reducing their exposure to our largest competitor. They chose the Nutanix Cloud platform, including our Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2, running on AWS, along with Nutanix Cloud Management. This enables them to reduce their projected TCO by nearly 50%, while also consolidating their existing data center footprint.\nOn the product front, we recently announced the general availability of GPT-in-a-Box 2.0, our solution for simplifying the deployment of generative AI applications. A key component of this offering is Nutanix Enterprise AI, or NAI, which helps streamline deployment scaling and running of influencing end points for large language models. NAI can be deployed within GPT-in-a-Box on-prem or at the edge or independently, on native public cloud services, such as AWS, EKS, and Azure AKF. These new capabilities help further our vision of becoming the leading platform for running all apps and managing data anywhere.\nA first-quarter new logo with the government ministry in the EMEA region demonstrated early progress with the new generative AI and modern application capabilities of our platform. This customer was looking to modernize their infrastructure and chose a full stack Nutanix solution to support development and deployment of their cloud-native and generative AI applications. They chose our GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution including our Nutanix Kubernetes Platform and Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure, as well as our Nutanix Unified storage and Nutanix Database Service offerings.\nMoving on, we also continue to make progress on the partnership front, signing an expanded strategic partnership with AWS that will simplify cloud migrations and offer access to AWS services for customers looking to migrate to NC2 on AWS. As part of this collaboration, customers will gain access to promotional credits from AWS to support customer migrations and proof-of-concept trials as well as Nutanix licensing promotions. Customers can also gain access to promotional credits for migrating VMware cloud and AWS workloads to NC2 on AWS through the AWS VMware migration accelerator program.\nFinally, we continue to receive industry recognition in Q1, being named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for distributed hybrid infrastructure, alongside some of the leading public cloud providers, improving from our challenged position in the 2023 Magic Quadrant.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our solid first-quarter results. Our ongoing innovation on our cloud platform, particularly with respect to its support for generative AI and modern applications and on the progress we continue to make on partnerships. We remain focused while driving sustainable, profitable growth.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Rajiv, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will first discuss our Q1 fiscal '25 results, followed by our guidance for Q2 fiscal '25 and an updated outlook for the full fiscal year 2025.\nResults in Q1 '25 came in above the high end of our range across our guided metrics. Revenue in Q1 was $591 million, higher than the guided range of $565 million to $575 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 16%. The outperformance in revenue was driven by good renewals execution. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.966 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%.\nWe saw strength in landing new customers onto our platform, helped by more leverage from our OEM and channel partners from the various programs we have put in place to incentivize new logos and from a general increase in engagement from customers looking at us as an alternative in the wake of industry M&A.\nNRR, or net dollar-based retention rate at the end of Q1 was 110%. Expansion with existing customers was impacted largely by our US federal business for which Q1 is a seasonally strong quarter given their September 30 fiscal year-end. Our US Fed business performance was lower year over year relative to the strong comparison from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to impacts from the elongated continuing resolution resulting in lighter spending from our Fed customers.\nBased on our current view, we expect our US federal business performance to return to more normal levels in the second quarter. In Q1, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels, which we believe is influenced by the macroeconomic environment and continued increased scrutiny on spend. In addition, as discussed during prior earnings calls, we believe the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure.\nThese factors also impact our ARR growth. Average contract duration in Q1 was to 3.1 years flat sequentially quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 87.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 20%, higher than our guided range of 14.5% to 15.5%, largely due to higher revenue and to a smaller extent, due to lower expenses including as a result of certain nonrecurring payments and credits.\nNon-GAAP net income in Q1 was $122 million, of fully diluted EPS of $0.42 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares. GAAP net income and fully diluted GAAP EPS in Q1 were $30 million and $0.10 per share, respectively. Free cash flow in Q1 was $152 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 26%.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalence and short-term investments of $1.075 billion up from $994 million at the end of Q4.\nMoving to capital allocation. We repurchased about $20 million worth of shares in Q1 and used about $79 million of cash in Q1 to retire shares related to our employees' STAC liability for their quarterly RSU vesting.\nMoving to Q2 '25. Our guidance for Q2 is as follows: revenue of $635 million to $645 million; non-GAAP operating margin of 20% to 21%; fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares.\nMoving to the full year. The updated guidance for fiscal year '25 is as follows: revenue of $2.435 billion to $2.465 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 14% at third point and no change from our initial guidance. The non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 16% to 17%, an increase from our previous guidance. Free cash flow of $560 million to $610 million, representing a free cash flow margin of approximately 24% at the midpoint and an increase of $15 million relative to our prior initial guidance at the midpoint.\nI will now provide some commentary and assumptions regarding our updated fiscal year '25 guidance. First, we are seeing continued land-and-expand opportunities and a growing pipeline for our solutions. However, as we have discussed previously, we expect continued uncertainty in the timing, outcome and deal structure from the growing mix of larger deals in the pipeline. And as I mentioned earlier, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels, which we believe is related to the uncertain spending environment and which we expect to continue.\nSecond, the guidance assumes that renewals will continue to perform well in fiscal year '25. Third, the full-year guidance assumes that average contract duration will be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '24 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings.\nFourth, the non-GAAP operating margin guidance assumes incremental prudent investments in sales and marketing and research and development, targeted towards addressing our large market opportunity. Those investments are expected to continue to ramp through the course of the fiscal year.\nFinally, a note on seasonality. Based on our current view of renewal's cohorts and visibility into land and expand, we expect revenue seasonality in fiscal Q3 relative to Q2 to be similar to what we saw in fiscal year '23.\nIn closing, we are pleased that our Q1 performance exceeded the high end of our guidance and would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, investors and stakeholders for their continued trust in us. We remain committed to continued progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth, both through durable top line growth and expanding margins.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Pinjalim Bora, JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora\nRajiv, one for you. Maybe can you talk about what are you hearing from customers around the VMS offering? Trying to understand if this new partnership with AWS. It might act as a catalyst to kind of convince people to move to NC2 or are you seeing any signs of that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nOkay. Pinjalim, Rajiv here. I think you meant VMC on AWS, correct? You said VMS --\nPinjalim Bora\nCorrect. VMC, correct.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nVMC on AWS, correct. Okay. All right. So clearly, I think that seems to be an offering that Broadcom is not focused on as much. And it's created an opportunity for us, for sure, and customers are concerned as to what might happen with their offering.\nFor example, the go cloud version of their offering, garment cloud version was apparently deprecated by Broadcom. So this is one of the impetus for the expanded partnership that we have with AWS, where we are working together with them to provide EVM migration for customers from BMC onto NC2 on AWS. We talked about one of the wins last quarter actually, leading universities that actually went and did exactly that. And anyway. So this is really one of the impetus why AWS is partnering with us.\nThey're offering immigration credit. The migration accelerator program, and we are working together to help customers who might be interested in migrating off that offering on to something else in the public\nPinjalim Bora\nYes. Understood. One for Rukmini. Rukmini, I'm trying to understand the guidance. It seems like a very solid Q1 beat.\nYou took the Q2 numbers up, but the second half seems like it's an implied guide down because you didn't take the full year number up. So I'm trying to understand, is that just prudent caution around what you're seeing on the sales cycles, Were there any deals that mkind of moved from the second half into the first half that changed the seasonality a bit? And lastly, do you think we're close to a trough on NRR?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Pinjalim. Both good questions. I'll start with your revenue guidance first. So yes, we were happy with our Q1 revenue performance, but we are only one quarter into fiscal year. And given the uncertain environment, including that related to a new administration in the US, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year top-line guide until we have a better view of how the rest of the year is going to play out.\nAnd as I noted in my prepared remarks, we continue to see these modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. And we believe that the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions, more approvals and causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in deal structure outcome and timing.\nAnd finally, from a seasonality perspective, we've historically seen a fairly even split in revenue between the first half and second half of the fiscal year. So our current expectations aren't that different from what we've seen historically.\nSo that's on the revenue top-line guidance question, Pinjalim. I think your second part of the question was around NRR. So a few things on NRR. First, I will say that given that our GRR, while we don't disclose it, we've said in the past that it has not changed significantly relative to recent levels. So given that, the largest driver of net new ARR is land and expand ACV, right?\nAnd your question specifically is on which does not, for example, benefit from the strength that we saw in our land. So I want to first start by clarifying that. And we did see some divergence there between sort of the strength in our land performance.\nNow with respect to expand, with existing customers, expand accounts for the majority of our land and expand, which was impacted largely by our US Fed business, which was lower year over year relative to the strong compare we had from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to the CR and the continuing resolutions in the US. And so all the dynamics you talked about in large sales cycle, larger deal sizes, various sales cycles or that does impact expand as well, Pinjalim. So that all did go into the NRR number.\nNow I think your question was around, is this the -- is this -- have we hit sort of the low point for NRR. We don't guide to NRR, as you know. But we do expect that and will be impacted by some of these factors that we've talked about like the sales cycles and the mix of large deals when we expect some of that to continue.\nSo that, we believe is the case, but we don't explicitly guide to NRR.\nOperator\nMeta Marshall, Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall\nGreat. Maybe following up on the federal piece. You noted in the script that you expected kind of fiscal Q2 to be better. I would expect you would need the administration change, so maybe you wouldn't expect kind of federal to improve until fiscal Q3, but just wanted to kind of listen about what went into that commentary or you could explain that more. And then maybe just a second question.\nJust any update on timing of Dell PowerFlex kind of integration? Just anything there would be helpful.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo Meta, on the federal question, I mean, we don't have visibility in terms of what the new administration is going to do or not do. So we can't really talk about what's going to happen after the new agitation comes in. So we have a near-term view on Q2, of course, which we factored in. And that's why we feel comfortable about our federal business coming back to more normal levels in Q2 based on what we know today. And of course, we'll have to see what the new administration does after they come on board.\nNow on the Dell question, specifically. So as you know, Meta, there's two parts to the Dell relationship. One is the existing hyper-converged solution that we have, which will be an appliance sale by combining our software on their service. That's been in the market now this quarter, and it's still early days for that.\nYour question on PowerFlex. We expect to have that in the market in the first half of calendar '25, and we expect to see some revenue contribution from it in FY26.\nOperator\nJim Fish, Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish\nI did want to build off of Meta's question and Pinjalim there a little bit. Can you just remind us how big this federal vertical can be for you guys here in fiscal Q1 versus kind of what you saw here? And what the actual impact net retention rate was? Like are we talking about a point or two difference that we would have seen versus the 110% or how to kind of quantify that?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nI'll take that, Jim. So First, on quantification of Fed, we don't disclose that, Jim. But as you can imagine and we've said this before, that for our Q1 is typically the seasonally strongest quarter given it's also the federal year-end, which covers September 30. So we don't disclose that number, Jim, but that is Q1 is our strongest Fed quarter. And similarly, right, we're not going to break out NRR impact by Fed or by any other sort of segmentation at this point.\nBut we did see the fact that overall Fed and expand specifically was lower than last year. It was a challenge for us in Q1 relative to what we saw last Q1, which was a strong one to compare.\nJames Fish\nGot it. And Rajiv, maybe for you. I think we're all kind of anxious to hear about when we could see more stand-alone into other storage arrays. Obviously, you just talked about the calendar first half of '25 seeing Dell PowerFlex. But how should we start thinking about Nutanix's relationships of getting stand-alone AHV integration into some of the other providers out there?\nAnd why we wouldn't start to see that AHV attach go from 7% today to faster to 100?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I think those are two different questions there, Jim. I think on the first question, clearly, the only one that we've announced so far has been Dell PowerFlex relationship. As you can imagine, we do have plans to expand that selectively to other storage arrays over time. I'm not going to preannounce anything right now, but you can assume that we are working on that in a very careful way. At the same time, we also want to make sure that whatever we do is actually focusing on expanding the market opportunity for us and doesn't cannibalize the existing HCI opportunity.\nSo we are focused specifically on working with storage array vendors that are workloads that would not necessarily be easier to capture with HCI because the workload we can capture with our own HCI platform, we would like to do that at the full stack.\nAnd over time, even for those that we do go in our goal is to sell the full stack over time. So stay tuned. I mean, we, of course, will continue to explore other options in the market when it comes to other storage arrays. And you can -- we don't have any more to say at this point. But the idea is to start with Dell and then over time expand to others.\nWith respect to your question on AHV penetration. Again, I think our philosophy has always been we support multiple hypervisors. And there's been a natural cadence to buy which the AHV adoption has continued to grow, and we are still at where it is. I don't necessarily need it to be 100%, frankly, but our goal is to increase the AHV footprint because we also want to be able to insert into VMware accounts, where our platform is running on top of ESX, the VMware hypervisor, and we'll continue to support that going forward as well.\nBut we would, of course, like to see more and more customers start to migrate over to our ASV footprint. And having, of course, this third-party storage support will only help amplify that.\nOperator\nJason Ader, William Blair.\nJason Ader\nSo when I look at the second half and you gave basically guidance revenue per quarter for the second half. But then looking at the operating margin for the year, you raised that only slightly after having pretty significant outperformance in Q1 and also guiding to a pretty robust operating margin in Q2. So that implies the second half is going to be kind of weigh down on the operating margin.\nAnd I know you said you're going to be ramping expenses, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing kind of idiosyncratic to the second half that we're not thinking about. And then can you talk about where that ramp up in spending is going to come. You said sales and marketing and R&D, but could you be more specific within those buckets.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nJason, first, on operating margin. So you're correct. So first, I'll start with revenue. What we said was -- I think in response to an earlier question, that our implied revenue split, first half to second half is roughly even based on the -- and that's similar to our historical patterns. While we expect operating expenses on the other hand, to grow over the course of the year, much like it did last fiscal year.\nSo to your point, you're correct that we will expect to see lower operating margins in the second half of the year and fiscal year '25. However, overall, we still expect to see year-over-year improvement in operating margin for the full fiscal year relative to fiscal year '24. And then to the second part of your question on where are we spending those dollars.\nSo first, in R&D, we have talked about investing, for example, in these AHV standalone to support the stand-alone storage arrays. So that's one area of R&D investment. Some other examples include we have ramped up our offerings around cloud native or containerized applications. That's another area generative AI plus our core enterprise platform, right, to the platform and making sure that it continues to evolve. So even within our core platforms, there are innovations that we continue to drive.\nSo that's on the R&D side, some examples of where we're investing.\nOn the sales and marketing side, we have talked about some investments we've made -- some we made last year and some will continue into this year, for example, around product specialist sellers, folks who are focused on selling our entire portfolio and helping our main field sellers go do that. We have increased some investments around the channel as another example, some inside sales folks who can be focused on driving both expansion and land around the more mid-market tiers. So those are some examples of areas that we're investing in both sales and marketing and in R&D.\nOperator\nWamsi Mohan, Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nIt's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Rukmini, the renewals business has been strong. How should we think about the growth in available to renew pool in fiscal '25 versus fiscal '24? And is there any danger that renewals kind of fall off a cliff in fiscal '26? Or is there a large enough cohort of customers who are going to renew in fiscal '26 that strong growth in renewals continues and it grows as a mix of the business.\nSo just your thoughts on available to renew pool and how you see that business continuing to grow?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. So you're correct that we did talk about renewals doing well for Q1. In terms of ATR for full year fiscal year '25, I think we referred to this in our last earnings call when we gave you all the initial guide for fiscal year '25. Available to the new pool or ATR is expected to grow nicely in '25 year over year versus '24, and we'll continue to grow quite nicely over the next few years, Ruplu. So I'm not going to give you a quantification for fiscal year '26 at this point.\nWe're still only one quarter into '25. But yes, we expect that growth in available to renew for our renewal cohorts to continue for the next couple of years.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nOkay. And maybe for my follow-up, I'll ask you another question. Free cash flow in fiscal 1Q was very strong. It was $152 million, which I don't think, over the last three, four years, you've had such a strong 1Q. Were there any one-time items?\nI know last quarter, you had said that you might get from a partner, I think you had said $30 million benefit for the full year in terms of free cash flow. So any guidance on how we should think about the progression of free cash flow first half versus second half in this year?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. We were happy with our free cash flow performance in Q1, as you alluded to. So nothing significant, I would call out as onetime. So you're right, those partner payments, we did call out for fiscal year '25 and those will continue to come in. They might be a little inconsistent in terms of quarter to quarter, but we're not breaking that out quarterly, Ruplu.\nThere wasn't any one thing I would call out. For example, in Q4, in our July quarter, we did call out there was one significant deal that we collected in that quarter. For example, there was nothing like that, that I would call out for Q1. And more generally, I think when you think about just, I think rest of the year, part of your question is $152 million was a strong Q1, and our full-year guide is $560 million to $610 million. And so I'll just remind you that, one, expenses are going up, expected to go up through the rest of the year.\nSo keep that in mind, right, those expenses will ramp over the course of the year, much like they did last fiscal year. So that in. And we do collect multiple years of cash from our customers typically upfront. And so that does mean that depending on duration or depending on some larger deals, there can be some variation quarter to quarter in that number, which is why we continue to guide for free cash flow really on an annual basis only.\nOperator\nMike Cikos, Needham.\nMichael Cikos\nI'm going to ask a boring one on guidance and build on some of the line of questioning that Mr. Rader was going after on the operating margin and the operating profit. But I just wanted to get a better understanding congratulations on the 20% operating margin we're seeing here in Q1.\nIs the view for full year in any way informed like are we potentially behind on hiring versus where we expected to be exiting Q1? Or are you potentially increasing your view of additional investments in sales and marketing and R&D? Because I know that's something that we had flagged on the previous quarter. Just wanted to wrestle those two items.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Mike. Always welcome the boring question on the guide. So thank you for that. Not at all boring, actually. It's very, very practical.\nSo when we think of spend and our planning cycles, Mike. So we're coming out of our planning cycle. And so as we deploy this, again, similar to last fiscal year, some of this will be ramping over the course of the year. So that is in the plan. And so you'll continue to see that this year relative to last year, right?\nSo there's nothing unusual or different necessarily that I would call out other than, of course, as we hire people in Q1 or Q2, they might be there for partially for that quarter. But then for the next quarter, they're there for the full quarter, right? So there is that almost normalization that happened over the course of the year. And so that's what's baked into the op margin guide for the full year relative to what you saw in Q1.\nMichael Cikos\nGot it. And then just one other, if I could. I know that we're -- and I appreciate the commentary here as well as far as the Q2 versus 3Q seasonality on revenue. I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about this properly, even if I go back beyond last year, two years ago, we tend to see coal at a 7% to 8%, 7% feels about right as far as a sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3. And I appreciate your qualitative comments, but if you could further elaborate on that.\nWhat is driving that seasonal component? Is it really tied to year-end in Q2 and then maybe the sales incentive comp for your sales force in Q4? Is that why we should be thinking about that Q2 to Q3 sequential movements that we're talking to?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nYou're exactly right, Mike. So historically, if you look at our performance, Q2 and Q4 tend to be seasonally stronger quarters from a top line perspective, exactly for the recency outline because Q2 has the December year-end. And Q4 had our end of fiscal year, and therefore, some sales incentives tied to a strong finish there. What has happened also is as we now have the renewal cohorts layering in, they tend to follow similarly the land expand performance in the past because they're just reflective of deals that were signed and when those renewals view.\nSo now we have the impact of historical land and expand, but the renewal cohorts are also following that pattern. So we just wanted to remind folks of that going into Q3 and give you a sense of qualitatively, what to expect relative to the Q2 guidance.\nOperator\nBen Bollin, Cleveland Research Company.\nBen Bollin\nRajiv, I wanted to get your perspective a bigger picture on enterprise refresh behavior, in particular, around how you see customers evolving around three-tier versus HCI? Any thoughts on the pace and rate of enterprise on-prem AI deployments?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I'll take those two questions separately. I don't think Ben that much has changed with respect to three-tier versus HCI. We still continue to validate the proposition of 40% -- 40% to 50% lower TCO if you replace your three-tier with SCI and it also provides you the platform to really expand into becoming a hybrid cloud, which is what companies want. And so over time, I do expect to continue to see HCI gain into the legacy three-tier offering. So that part hasn't really changed.\nThe dynamics really haven't changed. Of course, it's usually tied to a hardware refresh cycle because that's when you refresh your storage arrays. And instead of refreshing storage here is what we tell customers when they just buy simple servers and put HCI on it. So no change really on that front.\nOn enterprise AI, what we see again is that the bulk of the spend so far have been not really in the enterprise, but in these large hyperscalers as they build out these massive clusters to train these large language models with huge investments from a small handful of very large providers. So we see that for sure.\nNow within the enterprise, most enterprises are, I would say, in the early stages of deploying Generative AI, largely for RAG relative long into generation and fine-tuning and inferencing. They're not going to train these models. They're going to use models that are pre-existing and then use them to drive inferencing but more cost-effective, smaller clusters. We think that, that segment of the market is in early stages. We have seen the first set of applications come about.\nEven this quarter, as you know, we talked about this government customer in EMEA that's starting to use our GPT 2.0 offering. I would say most enterprises are in the early stages of adoption, including ourselves, where we're targeting to see things like a 25% productivity gain for our developers, our improvements in how we manage legal contracts. So companies looking at fraud detection. These are the kind of use cases that we're starting to see emerge. But I would say it's in the early days.\nMost enterprises are only now getting into the act of trying to build these applications. And I do think that this space is going to continue to grow over the next few years, but it's still largely incubation at this point in the enterprise.\nBen Bollin\nThat's great. And Rukmini, if I could. In the past, you had provided some perspective on the growth of $1 million-plus deals in your pipeline relative to the remainder of the business. Curious if you have any updates on that metric exiting the quarter?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ben. I will say we are continuing to see nice growth in our pipeline, including for the larger deals that we've talked about before, Ben, we're not updating those metrics specifically on a quarterly basis. But yes, we are seeing continued interest and engagement and growth in pipeline from those $1 million-plus sort of cohorts and more generally.\nOperator\nSimon Leopold, Raymond James.\nVictor Chiu\nThis is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to drill into your commentary around the increased customer engagement from VMware Basin. Maybe help us understand if this was an incremental acceleration relative to what you were previously observing? If so, maybe help us understand what's driving that and if you expect that to continue?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo, Victor, the market continues to be dynamic. But from our perspective, it's still largely unchanged in terms of our opportunity, a multiyear opportunity to gain share. So we haven't seen a significant change in that this quarter compared to the last several quarters really. And we haven't seen any real meaningful changes in our win-loss rate size around these opportunities. I'll say what we've already said before, right, a lot of these deals are tied to VMware customers, their ELA renewal cycles.\nThey try to when the installed base is coming up for a hardware refresh, although we are also expanding our ability to capture -- to have our solutions work on existing hardware like, for example, the three-tier work that we're doing with Dell or like continuing to be able to deploy our software on already existing BMS HCI customers. And of course, it's a dynamic market in the sense that sometimes we see aggressive behavior from Broadcom as well to keep those customers especially the very large ones. So really, I would say, net-net, nothing much has changed.\nVictor Chiu\nOkay. And if the organization decides that they wanted to move away from VMware kind of, on average, how long is that transition typically? And kind of what are the steps involved that required for a customer to do something like that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nCorrect. It depends on the scale and complexity of their deployment. So if they are -- for example, I'll give you the two bookends. So on the small -- on the easy side, if they are just largely the say, vSphere customer and they're willing to replace their hardware. It's a very easy migration.\nWe can migrate that within a month or two off a relatively small scale. A lot of that is automated as well. Same goes for public cloud to public cloud. And there was a question earlier about VMS Cloud on AWS. Those offerings are actually very easy to migrate.\nAgain, this in a month, we can have those customers off and on to a tan offer. But at the other end of the spectrum are these large customers that use multiple VMware products with massive estates. And there, it can be many years. It can be three years to do a migration. Just because they can't migrate all of it at once, there is a requirement for a professional services engagement to convert over some of their more complex custom scripts, they have return on customer investments they've made on top of the VMS portfolio.\nSo those migrations tend to be complex, require professional services and take a few years. So there's an entire spectrum across those.\nVictor Chiu\nDo you have maybe kind of a general ballpark kind of estimation of what percentage is the easy kind of low-hanging fruit? And what --?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I would say if you look at -- with the exception of, I think, if you go to a large Tier 1 big global accounts, those are the ones that are difficult, right? The vast majority of the smaller customers are going to be more on the easy side.\nOperator\nMatt Hedberg, RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg\nI just wanted to ask, obviously, it sounds like the federal business had some headwinds. Maybe just a simple question, but Rajiv, did the enterprise business, do you think it deteriorated from a demand perspective versus last quarter? Just because it seems like good revolve, but just trying to get a kind of finer point on sort of like your thought on enterprise spending today versus maybe many days ago?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. Matt, clearly, we saw the softness in Fed for sure. We saw it -- that was a very clear cut. The broader enterprise, I we've actually, again, been doing quite well at landing new logos and people migrating. But of course, some of that is perhaps due to just what's happening with the Broadcom situation.\nSo we haven't seen a decline in enterprise spend or less willingness to spend. What we have seen, and we've been talking about this in multiple quarters, Matt, is lot more inspection going on the Fed and a lot more approvals being required higher in the food chain, looking at TCO more carefully, which, of course, plays to our benefit in some articles what we talk about in this environment is how we can reduce TCO.\nSo that dynamic has been going on now for several quarters. We haven't seen much of a change. So net-net, I have to say it for the broader enterprise demand, we haven't seen a change this quarter compared to the prior quarters.\nMatthew Hedberg\nGot it. That's very clear. And then maybe another sort of, I guess, macro question for Rukmini. Obviously, it's not your year-end, but do you typically see a December budget flush from an enterprise percent? I can't imagine you're baking that into guidance.\nJust kind of curious on historically, do you see customers kind of spend it or lose it mentality when it comes to December, your calendar year end?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nI mean certainly, sometimes, right? I mean they may have a budget that's available for this year. We've seen that in the past. We probably will see some of that this year as well, right? I mean I think they do have -- I mean, if your company is on that calendar cycle, yes, you probably will have some budget to spend -- but again, I would not say we factor whatever we can see into our guide for Q2.\nSo nothing really different this year compared to prior years. And so typically, we see a seasonal increase in Q2 compared to Q1. And that's driven in part by the fact that what you alluded to, Matt, but people spending at the end of the year.\nOperator\nGeorge Wang, Barclays.\nI just had two quick ones. Firstly, can you kind of double-click in terms of the channel incentives in place kind of what has changed versus three months ago in terms of providing the promo and the incentives to the channel, especially at the backdrop of for maybe overlapping Nutanix or VMware contract?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean this is a few months ago that we made the change, no recent changes, by the way, on the channel side. We made that going a while ago. But what we did, we did a couple of things there, Joe. First thing we did was we took a subset of our customer base, our target prospects and handed them off entirely to the channel to go drive.\nAnd so we don't have our reps on those accounts. We leave it to the channel, and we provided more incentives to those channel partners to bring us business. So we have incentives in place for our channel partners to bring new logos to us in terms of rewards that they will get more rewards when they bring new logos to us. We are also committed to the channel in the sense that all our deals go through the channel partners. So we're not trying to work around them or shut them out of any of the deals.\nAnd so we've seen, certainly, as a result of all of that, a significant increase in channel partner engagement with us over the last year or two. Some of it is, of course, just what they're seeing with Broadcom, more child partners coming to us, some of it is our own incentives that we are offering for them.\nAnd we also have incentives for the end customer as well, right? So for example, to help them tide over migrations, we can offer them free licenses for a period of time to help them while they're still spending money on VMware to get going on our products until they're ready to go migrate fully over.\nOkay. Just a follow-up, if I can. Just in terms of repatriation, just as kind of a theme, which benefits on Nutanix. Just curious if anything has changed on the repenetration, any additional data points versus last quarter?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. In terms of cloud repatriation, I would say we haven't seen like a massive repatriation of workloads coming back from the public cloud. We see some of that here and there, right? That's where I would characterize it not has changed compared to past quarter. But I think what we see is, again, I can see there is people are much more careful about what they go put in the cloud.\nSo keep in mind that the vast majority of enterprise workloads are still on-prem, not in the public cloud. And now CIOs are being more circumspect about what to use the public cloud for. For example, there's a realization that if we have steady-state workloads, those workloads can be run more efficiently on-prem than in the public cloud. And so this CIO of therefore saying, well, I'm going to keep that workload on-prem. I'm not going to move that to the public cloud.\nSo that's what we are seeing.\nOperator\nNehal Chokshi, Northland Capital Markets.\nNehal Chokshi\nCongrats on the really strong new logo up to 2% year-over-year. That's really impressive. I'm trying to put though, why is ARR decelerating given the strong land that you're seeing? And then if I look at the incremental ARR, i.e., the change quarter-over-quarter or October quarter, relative to the year ago quarter, that was down a lot as well. So thoughts on why are there such a weak incremental ARR characteristics, especially given the backdrop that you're having such strong WAN metrics?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nNehal, thank you. So a few things to -- I'll start with on your point about net new ARR. So One of the biggest drivers of net new ARR, which is simply, as you pointed out, the difference between ARR in this quarter versus the prior quarter is land and expand ACV. And given that our GRR has not changed significantly relative to recent historical levels. And so when you think about land and expand, we did see some divergence, as you point out in the performance of the land versus the expand portion of our business.\nSo we saw strength in the new customers. And we've talked about why that is. And so really happy with that performance.\nExpansion with existing customers, which actually accounts for the majority of the land and expand was impacted largely by our US federal business, Nihal, and we've talked about why we believe that will be the case. And so -- and overall, by the way, right, we've talked about these larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline which are taking longer to close and have data variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. So all of those factors also do impact our ARR growth. So that's how to think about just ARR and net new ARR.\nOperator\nMichael, Wells Fargo.\nI'll ask one on behalf of Aaron. I just want to ask about GPT 2.0 or GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution. I'm just curious, as you think about, I guess, the positioning of that in the marketplace relative to kind of a full stack or a three-tier architecture with NVIDIA's AI enterprise software suite. How do these differ in terms of where they sit in the market that I guess do you see opportunity to maybe move up market as these solutions mature going forward?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean some of that is also a difference between training and inferencing. We are largely with GPT-in-a-Box focused on influencing, focusing on smaller clusters, not massive compute funds to our trade models. Smaller clusters that enterprises can use to deploy more cost-effective AI inferencing applications. I'll give you one example.\nWe, for example, one of our first use cases in Nutanix internally, was a customer service use case where incoming service request from a customer support ticket, the support engineer actually has a natural language into search interface through which they enter the query and then we look through all-on-one basis to try and accelerate our -- the ability to answer that issue. And that AI application is running on just a small cluster, okay, leaving an open source large language model.\nAnd that's the kind of upstarting on GPT-in-a-Box internally. And that's the kind of use case that we're enabling for the enterprise, where you have your secure data, you want to do your inferencing on it, using existing models that are already pretrained, but fine-tuned with your use cases. So that's a cost-optimized solution.\nAnd by the way, we are partnered with NVIDIA on that because we work with the immediate inferencing solution as well as, of course, using their GPUs to do all the hard work needed here. So again, I just think we want to distinguish between influencing on small clusters, which is mostly what we do versus training of very large clusters.\nThat's helpful. And if I can sneak one more in. Just as we think about an improving sort of traditional server end demand environment and as we think about refresh cycles. Obviously, that presents an insertion opportunity for you guys within three-tier architecture. So I'm curious with the new partnerships with Dell and Cisco.\nHave you seen your win rates at all changing? Or do you anticipate those improving given your kind of broader ability to enter those deals?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. First of all, I think I think Cisco and Dell selling our products is, of course, positive for us. And Cisco has been a good contributor to our new logos this quarter as well as last quarter. That is still, I think, very early days for us. And that's independent of the server refresh cycle or not, right?\nSecond, I would say, with respect to refresh cycles, yes, server refreshes will help, but also storage of freshers are important, right? Because that's when we get the opportunity to displace those three-tier architectures with HCI footprint. So both matter. I think having Dell and Cisco as friends in the market, of course, significantly helps. And at the same time, the refresh cycles -- more so, I would say storage or fresh and server refresh will help us insert HCI into existing deployments.\nOperator\nThank you, and thanks for participating. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.\n8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nA close up of a circuit board, its microchips creating a powerful computing system.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024.

This growth was driven by strong AI-related revenue, VMware bookings, and robust performance in non-AI semiconductor segments. Looking ahead to Q4, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) anticipates revenue of approximately $14.0 billion\nOn November 5, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced significant advancements in its VeloCloud product portfolio, aimed at supporting the growing adoption of AI and non-AI workloads in enterprises.

Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations.\nWedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry.\nBryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options.\nNonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: \"It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software \u2014 and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.\"\nRelated Videos\n04:18\nDealmaking should thrive in Trump's second term.

The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company\u2019s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.\nHowever, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern.

The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\nYet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth.

Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.\nStory Continues\nAggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind.

An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.\nThe hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.\nAnd while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.\nAnalysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) in the last month.\nHere are the major companies that have become popular shorts.\nPopular short stocks\nS3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.\nStory continues\nChipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.\nThe demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.\nAt the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.\nShares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.\nAnd Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.\nRead more: Rise in UK borrowing shows Reeves has 'little wiggle room' on spending\nThe discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.\nTesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.\nHowever, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve \"slight growth\" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.\nS3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).\nFollowing its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.\nS&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this \"may be related to the [US] election\".\nThey said that despite this significant activity in \"all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses\".\nGlobal short bets\nMeanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.\nThe data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on \"crowdedness\", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors\u2019 supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.\nLVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.\nThe company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an \"uncertain economic and geopolitical environment\" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.\nRead more: FTSE 100 and European-listed stocks to own in 2025, according to Barclays\nThe luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\nKering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.\nShares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.\nMultinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.\nDiageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIt has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.\nIn South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.\nRead more: What we know about planned UK private stock market Pisces\nHindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were \"nothing but a lie\".\nOn Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.\nShares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.\nIn a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were \"baseless\".\nHindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.\nHowever, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)\nWhat a fantastic six months it\u2019s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is NOW a Good Business?\nFounded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.\n1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nServiceNow\u2019s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters,\u00a0its year-on-year growth averaged\u00a024.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nSell-side analysts expect ServiceNow\u2019s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nServiceNow\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate\nServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\nStory Continues\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on ServiceNow, and with the recent rally, the stock trades at 17.6x forward price-to-sales (or $1,055 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than ServiceNow\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling.

This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like United Rentals (+550% five-year return).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

These platforms are expanding the company\u2019s abilities in the IT market.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) bulls believe the company\u2019s organic revenue growth after fiscal 2025 could clock in between 20% to 22%. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) can also expand its margins by 250bps annually, driven by 100bps from gross profits, 100bps from R&D reductions, and 50bps from SG&A leverage.\nServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0will also benefit from organic growth catalysts. Grand View Research predicts that the global information technology service management (ITSM) market will grow at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc.

One such country in the picture that\u2019s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Updates You Can\u2019t Miss This Weekend and Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight\nThe remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do \"everything they can to lock their digital doors\" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\"While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it\".\nMcFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.\nIn other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.\nThe search, which started on November 1st\u00a0took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished.

A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities.

        "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective.

However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nWhat's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?\nServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nCan we expect growth from ServiceNow?\nNYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nIf you'd like to know more about ServiceNow as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

While many are still bullish on further upside in the stock, we believe it's time to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the profits.\nServiceNow specializes in digital workflow automation, providing cloud-based workflow automation solutions that help organizations improve their operations. Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.\nThe company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.\nHard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage\nThe rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.\nApproximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.\nSome of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.\nOur bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft\u2019s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.\nCarahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn\u2019t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company\u2019s future relations with the government.\nIn a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.\nThis also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn\u2019t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock\u2019s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow ranks 24th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 97 hedge fund portfolios held NOW at the end of the second quarter which was 90 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.\nOn November 18, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) announced that it has expanded its strategic alliance with Microsoft. Building on their existing partnership, Service Now\u2019s Now Assist and Microsoft 365 Copilot integration will now enable streamlined workflows and enable self-service capabilities within Microsoft applications. In essence, the strategic alliance will help modernize front-office business processes. Copilot will simplify tasks through intelligent automation, while ServiceNow AI agents will manage workflows and offer solutions to complex problems.\n\u201cA strong partnership between ServiceNow and Microsoft means customers gain the best of both worlds: seamless, secure, and smart workflows. By combining our strengths, we're enabling organizations to harness AI and automation in ways that fundamentally change how they work\u2014reducing complexity, driving productivity, and helping teams move faster. This partnership isn\u2019t just about technology; it's about setting customers up for long-term success in a digital world.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "whole_article": "ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:\n14% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\nTo start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.\nNYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\nStory Continues\nIs ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

        "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nCramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:\n\u201cLet's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive\u2026 Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market\u2026 Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting\u2026 Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again\u2026 Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company\u2019s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.\nOverall NOW ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other AI headlines you shouldn't miss.\nSovereign AI: a new concept gaining traction in the realm of artificial intelligence. As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing \u201csovereign\u201d artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to \u201ccodify\u201d a country\u2019s culture, history, and collective intelligence.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 AI Headlines Making Waves Today\u00a0and\u00a015 AI News You Must Read Today.\nThat said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent\u2019s competitiveness and technological resilience.\nFilippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they \u201cunderstand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.\u201d\n\u201cAs this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.\u201d\nWhile AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.\nLatest Advancements in AI\nIn recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe\u2019s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world\u2019s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.\n\u201cWoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification\u201d.\nStory Continues\nOther fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.\nIn other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed \u201cOperator\u201d, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human\u2019s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. The planned release is part of a wider industry movement towards agents\u2014AI software capable of performing multi-step tasks for users with minimal oversight.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:NOW)\nMarket Capitalization: $215.95 billion\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based AI-driven platform that engages in the provision of enterprise cloud computing solutions.\nOn November 13, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN), provider of the Intelligent CX Platform, announced an expanded partnership to enhance employee and customer experiences. The turnkey AI-powered solution will integrate ServiceNow\u2019s Customer Service Management (CSM) with Five9\u2019s platform for streamlined self\u2011service and assisted service operations as well as unified customer support processes; leveraging solutions such as reducing operational costs, increasing agent efficiency, improving customer satisfaction, and simplifying contact center operations.\n\u201cOrganizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together. ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self\u2011service and assisted service across voice and digital channels. Our expanded partnership with Five9 takes this even further, combining the best of both platforms to streamline and unify contact center operations with a turnkey solution that\u2019s fast to deploy and delivers fast ROI.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 3rd on our list of AI headlines you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.
