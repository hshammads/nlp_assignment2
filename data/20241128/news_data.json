          "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love Meta (META)\nSince November 2019, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of 90.5%. But one standout stock has doubled the market - over the past five years, Meta has surged 183% to $569.99 per share. Its momentum hasn\u2019t stopped as it\u2019s also gained 18.8% in the last six months thanks to its solid quarterly results, beating the S&P by 5.7%.\nIs now still a good time to buy META? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Are We Positive On META?\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Reality Labs.\n1. Eye-Popping Growth in Customer Spending\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Meta because it measures how much the company earns from the ads shown to its users. ARPU can also be a proxy for how valuable advertisers find Meta\u2019s audience and its ad-targeting capabilities.\nMeta\u2019s ARPU growth has been impressive over the last two years, averaging 8.8%. Its ability to increase monetization while growing its daily active people demonstrates its platform\u2019s value, as its users continue to spend more each year.\nMeta ARPU\n2. Elite Brand Reduces Need for Marketing Campaigns\nConsumer internet businesses like Meta grow from a combination of product virality, paid advertisement, and incentives (unlike enterprise software products, which are often sold by dedicated sales teams).\nMeta is extremely efficient at acquiring new users, spending only 8.7% of its gross profit on sales and marketing expenses over the last year. This efficiency indicates that it has a highly differentiated product offering and strong brand reputation from scale, giving Meta the freedom to invest its resources into new growth initiatives while maintaining optionality.\nMeta User Acquisition Efficiency\n3. Outstanding Long-Term EPS Growth\nWe track the change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nMeta\u2019s EPS grew at a remarkable 16.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years, higher than its 11.6% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nMeta Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on Meta, and with its shares beating the market recently, the stock trades at 13.7x forward EV-to-EBITDA (or $569.99 per share). Is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it\u2019s free.\nStory Continues\nStocks We Like Even More Than Meta\nWith rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.\nPut yourself in the driver\u2019s seat by checking out our Top 6 Stocks for this week. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like United Rentals (+550% five-year return).

          "whole_article": "People walk past an Apple Inc. retail store in New York City. (Credit: ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images files)\nOne of the best ways to achieve success in the stock market is to look for \u201ccompounders,\u201d that is, companies that have the ability to earn high returns and then earn high returns on those high returns. Most investors have some understanding of the concept of compounding interest, or earning interest on interest. Compounding stocks work the same way, when companies make profits and then re-invest those profits and make an ever-increasing amount of money by making money on those profits, again and again, over decades.\nA compounding stock is a beautiful thing. Suppose a company can grow its earnings at 20 per cent a year. If we start at $1.00 per share in earnings, then after year one, earnings are $1.20. But now in the second year it makes 20 per cent on $1.20, if no dividends are paid out. So, after two years, earnings are now $1.44, after three years, $1.72. The math is incredibly powerful. At this rate, in 20 years earnings would grow to $33 per share. It\u2019s easy to see that a big stock gain would follow this sort of earnings growth.\nSo, if we have convinced you of the math, how do you go about finding a compounder? This is the tough part. Of course, looking for a quality company with good management is always a good start. But let\u2019s look at five other factors that might help identify a future compounder.\nTechnological advantage\nDoes the company have a technology no one else can offer? A technology breakthrough is a great start if a company wants to be a compounder. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google search engine is a good example, so much so that the U.S. government wants to limit its global dominance with recent moves to try to break up the company. Or, think of a satellite company. Obviously, not just anyone can send satellites up and provide communications and data services from space.\nBrand loyalists\nDoes the company offer a new, or better, service, or have a solid brand reputation that attracts and retains customer loyalty? Perhaps its products are viewed so highly that customers just keep coming back and competitors cannot make any inroads? Apple Inc., for example, may not have a technological moat, but its customers are absolutely fierce loyalists to the company and its products. Its brand is likely one of the most valuable in the world \u2014 and it shows in the company\u2019s financial numbers. Spotify Technology SA, interestingly, is another example, as Apple itself is a strong competitor. But Spotify\u2019s music streaming service came earlier than Apple\u2019s, and most would agree that Spotify offers the better service. So, despite Apple\u2019s strength in other areas and its massive financial clout, Spotify still has a larger market share of the music business than Apple does.\nStory Continues\nScale advantage\nDid the company have a head start in the industry and thus achieved scale to such an extent that it now benefits from lower costs, which makes it very difficult for competitors or startups to enter the business? Amazon.com Inc. is the easiest example here, at least in North America. From its early days selling books, the company has expanded to just about every product imaginable, and can typically deliver the next day. It spent billions on its network over decades to achieve scale and improve margins. Its scale is simply massive, and we certainly do not see many new competitors starting up trying to compete with it. It lost a lot of money in its early days, but now is a dominant player in several business areas, generating lots of cash and making it hard for competitors to make inroads.\nProtected market\nDoes the company have a protected, regulated market with the government and regulators simply limiting any possible future competition? There has been a lot of talk recently about uranium and rare-earth metals. With China and other countries controlling much of the production of these products, the United States is starting to get paranoid about security of supply for these important elements. Thus, simply having a resource deposit in North America could be a competitive advantage for companies. A simpler example is a drug company which develops a new product. Not only do drugs need government regulatory approval to even be sold, they also get a 20-year patent. That\u2019s a pretty strong moat.\nBarriers to switching\nFactors that can make a stock expensive but still a good buy\nReasons a stock might move in a direction you didn't expect\nAre products so embedded with customers that switching costs are too high or switching companies is just too difficult for customers? This is fairly common in the software industry. Once a company goes through the time, cost and hassle of implementing a new software system across its entire network, it is really hard for a competitor to come in and say, \u201cHey, if you get rid of all those systems it took two years to install and to train staff, we can do it cheaper.\u201d When faced with software and operating systems, price is not often the big motivator. Companies want systems that work and are exceptionally reluctant to switch. Thus, large incumbent companies tend to have a very big advantage in this sector.\nPeter Hodson, CFA, is founder of 5i Research Inc., an independent investment research network helping do-it-yourself investors reach their investment goals.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is asking a federal appeals court to throw out a ruling in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games that would force the search giant to overhaul its Play mobile app store.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIn Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes\nIn Italy\u2019s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing\nNew York City\u2019s \u2018Living Breakwaters\u2019 Brace for Stormier Seas\nGoogle said in a filing Wednesday that US District Judge James Donato\u2019s ruling is mistaken and asked that the outcome of the long-running litigation be set aside.\nFor one thing, Google argued, Donato should have recognized that the company competes with Apple Inc. in the smartphone market, as a different judge found when she concluded that Apple\u2019s conduct toward Epic didn\u2019t violate federal antitrust laws. The judge also erred in holding a trial with a jury last year instead of deciding himself whether Google acted anticompetitively, the company said. Google says Donato\u2019s ruling would force it to do business with rival app stores \u2014 which the company contends it is not legally required to do.\nGoogle\u2019s appeal is \u201cmeritless\u201d and relies on \u201cflawed arguments,\u201d a spokeswoman for Epic said in a statement. \u201cWe will fight to ensure that the jury\u2019s verdict and the court\u2019s injunction are upheld and Google is held to account for its anticompetitive behavior.\u201d\nA San Francisco jury concluded in December 2023 that Google violated antitrust law by blocking rival app stores through a series of revenue-sharing agreements with mobile device makers like Samsung. Following up with a fix in October, Donato ordered Google to allow developers to set up app marketplaces and offer consumers billing options other than its own payment system.\n\u201cThis case involves an extraordinary attempt by a lone competitor to use the federal judiciary to restructure the day-to-day operations of Google\u2019s app store, Google Play, and to unilaterally reshape markets with consequences for millions of non-parties,\u201dGoogle said in its filing. The jury verdict and Donato\u2019s injunction, unless reversed, \u201cwill directly undercut Google\u2019s efforts\u201d to compete against Apple, Google said.\nEpic first sued Google and Apple in August 2020, accusing them of blocking competition for rival app stores. The judge in the Apple case largely ruled against Epic, though she directed the iPhone maker to make some changes to its App Store rules. Epic and Apple are currently fighting in an Oakland federal court over whether the iPhone maker is abiding by that ruling.\nDonato has temporarily put his ruling on hold. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco can extend that delay pending the outcome of Google\u2019s appeal, or force Google to make changes to its business while simultaneously seeking to overturn the ruling.\nStory Continues\nOral arguments are scheduled on Feb. 3 at the Ninth Circuit.\n(Updates with Epic statement in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "It\u2019s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you\u2019re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both.\nMy advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.\nHere are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you\u2019re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.\nVideo games\nVideo games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You\u2019ll find deals on consoles including Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo\u2019s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I\u2019m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.\nA worker holds a Playstation 5 at a Best Buy store during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Nov. 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Jim Vondruska) \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nDiscounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve\u2019s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.\nHeadphones\nWhether you\u2019re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you\u2019re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.\nThe fourth generation of AirPods is showcased as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, Calif., Sept. 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo/File Photo) \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nIt\u2019s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can\u2019t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you\u2019re into.\nYou\u2019ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.\nLaptops\nIn the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You\u2019re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple\u2019s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft\u2019s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That\u2019s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.\nStory Continues\nGenerally, when you\u2019re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That\u2019s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they\u2019ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.\nTVs\nTVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don\u2019t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.\nWhen it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you\u2019re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.\nTelevisions are displayed for sale ahead of Black Friday at a Walmart Supercenter on Nov. 14, 2023, in Burbank, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mario Tama via Getty Images\nIf there\u2019s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it\u2019s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don\u2019t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you\u2019re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG\u2019s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.\nPhones and tablets\nIf you\u2019re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you\u2019re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you\u2019ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.\nTablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they\u2019re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.\nSmart speakers and streaming devices\nAmazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.\nAmazon\u2019s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku\u2019s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google\u2019s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I\u2019ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

On the other hand, only around 1% of Mac or iPhone users said they had received such as presents.\n\"iPhones are an unlikely gift, as the phone is just the beginning before someone (presumably the recipient) becomes responsible for ongoing mobile carrier charges,\" CIRP said. \"Giving an iPhone as a gift is kind of like giving someone a puppy. Mac computers are also rarely gifted. They are both expensive and personal, often needing to meet specific needs.\"\nWith the introduction of iOS 18.2, which will have more Apple Intelligence capabilities, financial companies had predicted a possible increase in Apple iPhone sales this quarter. CIRP's results, however, imply that although iPads and Apple Watches enjoy a little increase throughout the season, iPhones and Mac computers are not very popular alternatives for Christmas presents.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

For now, we expect GenAI smartphones will take their place in premium flagship devices and keep moving down in price tiers to rapidly grow to 70% of the smartphone market by 2028.\nPopal said generative AI-enabled smartphones would surpass premium devices and account for 70% of the market by 2028.\nApple's historic success is due to emerging countries like India, but it confronts problems in China, the US, and Europe.\nChinese manufacturers are transitioning from foldable handsets to generative AI smartphones, according to IDC's research director Anthony Scarsella. Foldables fell 7.4% in Q3 despite important vendor introductions. Scarsella said the category is predicted to expand 10.5% in 2024 and double-digit growth through 2028, with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 15.9%.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday.\nApple is reportedly changing its approach to software updates. The tech giant appears to be opting for staggered rollouts of new features instead of bundling everything into annual iOS releases.\nIn his latest weekly \u201cPower On\u201d newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said that Cupertino plans a significant update with iOS 18.4 this spring.\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.43%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest TODAY for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,410,360 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $282,072 or around 1,200 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.9% to close at $235.06 on Tuesday.\n\n\nRead More:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\nThe Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI news that broke the internet.\nOpenAI has been making headlines in the artificial intelligence realm ever since its existence, and it seems the company has something new to share almost every day. However, not all the\u00a0news surrounding the company is positive. In the latest news shared by\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0OpenAI has suspended access to its latest, highly anticipated video generation tool, Sora. This suspension followed a small group of artists who had leaked access to the tool to protest the treatment they\u2019ve been receiving at the company.\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News.\nArguing that the company used them as \u201cPR Puppets\u201d without pay, the artists created a webpage allowing anyone to make AI videos using Sora. OpenAI granted hundreds of artists free access to the video generation tool so that they could test out the new artificial intelligence video generator. However, 20 of these artists argued that the company had taken advantage of their unpaid labor. This is what the group of artists wrote on Hugging Face, an open-source repository for artificial intelligence projects.\n\u201cHundreds of artists provide unpaid labor through bug testing, feedback and experimental work for the program for a $150B valued company\u201d.\nThe artists further added that the opportunities offered in return for helping the company, such as being selected to have their Sora-created films screened, offer \u201cminimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives. The tool was public three hours before it was shut down. OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said that the company has temporarily shut down user access to Sora while it looks into the situation.\n\u201cHundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora\u2019s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards. Participation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool.\u201d\nIn other news, Axios reported that President-elect Donald Trump is considering naming an \"AI czar\" in the White House that will be coordinating federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence. While Elon Musk isn\u2019t going to be the AI czar, he is expected to be involved.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "By Arriana McLymore\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. holiday shoppers have big plans to use small screens for a head start this year on Thanksgiving Day, and retailers have spent weeks priming them, touting pre-Black Friday online discounts for everything from TVs and toys to Bluetooth speakers.\nMajor retailers including Walmart and Target close their brick-and-mortar stores on Thanksgiving Day, reopening their doors on Black Friday. But tech-savvy 18- to 24-year-olds who may be with their families for Thanksgiving are likely to make mobile purchases from their sofas.\nShoppers have been lured by the convenience of apps that have made it much easier in recent years to make purchases from retailers' websites using mobile devices.\n\"What we've always seen is this gap between shoppers looking and browsing from their phones, but then they go back to their computers and buy,\" said Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce. That gap is shrinking as retailers streamline payment methods including Google Pay and Apple Pay, store billing and shipping information for loyalty members and tailor merchandise suggestions to users.\nFor the months of November and December, mobile spending is set to hit a record $128.1 billion, up 12.8% from last year, according to Adobe Analytics, which keeps track of the type of devices that use Adobe's software to help power more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites.\nGen-Z consumers, who are comfortable shopping and comparing prices on their mobile phones, are driving the shift toward mobile spending, and are likely to influence their families to do the same over Thanksgiving, noted Minkyung Kim, Assistant Professor of Marketing at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.\nMobile spending -- transactions made on a smartphone, tablet or laptop -- is expected to account for 53% share of online spending in November and December, totaling about $128.1 billion to surpass last year's record high expectation of $113 billion, Adobe said.\nThalia LeBlanc, 33, said \"nine times out of 10\" she is shopping on Target or Nordstrom's retail apps from her phone or iPad. LeBlanc plans to spend $2000 on gifts for her family throughout the holiday season, with most of her purchases being on Amazon's app.\nConvenience is a significant factor for shoppers who want to avoid long lines and crowded stores on Black Friday and throughout the holiday season. In the first 24 days of November, 51.6% of online shopping happened on a mobile device, an increase from 49.5% during the same time period last year, according to Adobe Analytics.\nStory Continues\nU.S. shoppers spent $39.9 billion through their phones, tablets and other mobile devices during that time, a 13.3% year-over-year increase, Adobe Analytics said.\nThe ease of shopping from mobile apps is also enticing shoppers to spend more money and make frequent purchases at their favorite retailers.\nLeBlanc said apps from retailers like Amazon and Nordstrom make it easier for her to shop and complete other tasks, like paying off store-branded credits cards. LeBlanc, a Dallas, Texas resident, said exclusive deals and discounts also give her a reason to revisit the shopping apps.\nSurf apparel brand Roxy said 60% of its web traffic is from mobile devices and most purchases come from loyalty members.\n\"The average basket is higher on the app and the conversion rate is also higher,\" said Nur Ghossien Martin, a retail information technology director at Roxy's parent company Boardriders. Roxy's average basket size on its app is 85 euros (USD $89) compared to 80 euros (USD $83.80) on its mobile website, according to Ghossien Martin.\nShe said in previous years, the company has launched deals to get more shoppers to download the Roxy app during the holiday.\nAmazon is known as a leader in mobile shopping given the capabilities of its online store. Ahead of the holidays, the company expanded its generative AI chatbot Rufus and launched Amazon Haul, its low-priced store set to compete with Shein's and PDD Holdings to sell $12 dresses and $10 toys. The catch: shoppers can only access Amazon Haul through the e-commerce app.\nBringing that exclusivity of Amazon Haul to the app shows there is more room for growth in encouraging consumers to shop from their phones, said Melissa Minkow, global director of retail strategy at consultancy CI&T. She said \"habitual\" purchases on Amazon are likely to encourage more shopping on its mobile app.\nEven as Amazon lures mobile shoppers with cheap holiday merchandise, Schwartz said Salesforce is seeing \"more high ticket item buyers transacting on their phones\" due to retailers giving detailed product descriptions and better mobile apps and websites.\nTypically, retailers including Amazon and Mango will boost capacity and stress-test their websites and apps in the weeks leading up to the holiday season in preparation for an influx of bargain-hungry shoppers.\nThe boost in online traffic makes it \"even more imperative for brands and retailers to invest in mobile-first technology,\" Schwartz said.\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York City and Juveria Tabassum in Bangalore; Editing by David Gregorio)\nView Comments"

Even after the stellar debut, the new company faces several challenges, the report added, including public skepticism about autonomous vehicles, data privacy concerns, and competition from companies, including Tesla which has promised to roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year. The company has said that its US operations will remain limited in scope for the foreseeable future.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 286\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. On November 26, the company announced that AWS Partner Assistant, a generative AI\u2013powered virtual assistant built on Amazon Q Business, was now available for partners in AWS Partner Central and the AWS Marketplace Management Portal. Per the tech giant, the assistant makes it easier to get quick answers to common questions. It reduces the need for manual searches by generating real-time guidance and concise summaries from guides and documentation, the firm added.\nStory Continues\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks that you should not ignore. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN \u00a0as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "It\u2019s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you\u2019re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both.\nMy advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.\nHere are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you\u2019re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.\nVideo games\nVideo games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You\u2019ll find deals on consoles including Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo\u2019s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I\u2019m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.\nA worker holds a Playstation 5 at a Best Buy store during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Nov. 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Jim Vondruska) \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nDiscounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve\u2019s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.\nHeadphones\nWhether you\u2019re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you\u2019re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.\nThe fourth generation of AirPods is showcased as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, Calif., Sept. 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo/File Photo) \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nIt\u2019s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can\u2019t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you\u2019re into.\nYou\u2019ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.\nLaptops\nIn the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You\u2019re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple\u2019s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft\u2019s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That\u2019s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.\nStory Continues\nGenerally, when you\u2019re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That\u2019s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they\u2019ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.\nTVs\nTVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don\u2019t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.\nWhen it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you\u2019re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.\nTelevisions are displayed for sale ahead of Black Friday at a Walmart Supercenter on Nov. 14, 2023, in Burbank, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mario Tama via Getty Images\nIf there\u2019s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it\u2019s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don\u2019t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you\u2019re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG\u2019s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.\nPhones and tablets\nIf you\u2019re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you\u2019re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you\u2019ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.\nTablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they\u2019re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.\nSmart speakers and streaming devices\nAmazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.\nAmazon\u2019s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku\u2019s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google\u2019s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I\u2019ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Its shares fell 35% the next day, wiping out more than $54 billion of market value.\nU.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in Oakland, California, however, said Netflix's earlier claims to be \"roughly 60% penetrated\" in the United States and Canada with \"a lot of headroom\" to grow were not false or misleading, because they referred to paid subscribers and did not imply that growth was certain.\nHe also found no proof Netflix concealed any determination that account sharing would severely hinder growth.\n\"At most,\" he said, the plaintiff's allegations suggest that the Los Gatos, California-based company investigated account sharing and found it to be \"one potential threat to growth among many.\"\nLawyers for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Netflix and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.\nTigar had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit in January. Tuesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, the trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, cannot amend his complaint again.\nThe case is Pirani v Netflix Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-02672.

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Netflix stock (NFLX) closed at a fresh record every day this past week, with shares securing their biggest weekly gain since January \u2014 and they could keep soaring.\nA growing number of analysts are calling for the streaming giant's shares to soon trade in the quadruple digits.\nOn Wednesday, Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak raised his price target on Netflix to a Street high of $1,100 a share, implying over 20% upside based on current trading levels of around $900.\nBank of America's Jessica Reif Ehrlich followed one day later, boosting her target to $1,000 from $800. Jefferies analyst James Heaney also raised his target to $1,000 earlier this week.\nThe price target increases come despite some concerns over slowing growth for the streaming giant.\n\u2022 USD\n(NFLX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nWall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $800 a share, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.\nOne of the main catalysts for the recent price target boosts is the company's continued foray into live events, with the most recent boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson attracting over 108 million global viewers last weekend to become the most-streamed sporting event of all time.\nFor context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers.\nThe Netflix event's impressive numbers came despite the streamer experiencing several technical glitches throughout the broadcast, which analysts (and investors) mostly shrugged off.\n\"We view the event as a (very) successful learning experience for NFLX and expect these technical issues will not happen again with future live events,\" Pivotal Research's Wlodarczak wrote on Wednesday.\nThe analyst said the event's success likely means Netflix will \"accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming,\" which will help lower subscriber churn and increase the streamer's ability to raise prices.\n\"The NFLX service remains a highly compelling, frankly relatively inexpensive, entertainment alternative for consumers, which bodes well for future subscriber/average revenue per user growth,\" he said.\nNetflix's 'complementary growth drivers'\nKatie Taylor, Mike Tyson, Ariel Helwani, Jake Paul, and Amanda Serrano speak onstage at the press conference in promotion for the upcoming Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match at The Apollo Theater on May 13, 2024, in New York City. (Sarah Stier/Getty Images for Netflix) \u00b7 Sarah Stier via Getty Images\nSince the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged roughly 85%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.\nStory Continues\nLast week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.\nNetflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyonc\u00e9 will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.\nThe company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nJefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a \"breakthrough\" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.\nBofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, \"Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.\"\nNetflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.\nStill, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat \u2014 a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.\n\"With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.\nValuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock \"is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025.\" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best extremely profitable stocks to buy now.\nCan the S&P Hit 7,000 By the End of 2025?\nEd Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, appeared on CNBC on November 27 to share insights on the market's anticipated performance in 2025. He emphasized the significance of staying invested despite existing risks and high valuations, noting that the economy has shown resilience and interest rates have stabilized.\nYardeni pointed out that many new investors are gravitating toward small and mid-cap sectors, which he considers a sound strategy due to their relative affordability. He also highlighted the S&P 493 stocks as being undervalued compared to the Magnificent Seven, asserting that the overall market outlook remains positive despite potential tariff fluctuations. He believes that tax cuts and deregulation could enhance corporate earnings.\nYardeni attributed much of the market's potential growth to an ongoing productivity boom, which he described as still being in its early stages. He noted that productivity levels have improved significantly from nearly zero in 2015 to around 2% currently, with historical precedents suggesting that such booms can reach as high as 4%. This improvement is driven by advancements in technology, which he argues will continue to drive productivity gains.\nREAD ALSO: 10 Most Promising New Technology Stocks According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Tech Stocks to Invest In On the Dip.\nWhen discussing whether this boom is primarily driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Yardeni acknowledged AI's importance but also pointed to other technological advancements in cloud computing, robotics, and automation as contributing factors.\nHe identified a shortage of skilled labor as a key driver of productivity growth and explained that technology has enhanced efficiency, allowing wages to rise faster than prices, thus stimulating economic activity. In his concluding remarks, Yardeni projected that the S&P 500 could reach 7,000 by the end of 2025 and potentially hit 10,000 by the end of the decade, reflecting his bullish outlook on market performance fueled by these economic dynamics.\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the 10 best extremely profitable stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener, we shortlisted stocks that have grown their revenue and net income by at least 25% over the past 5 years. After sorting our initial list by market cap, we cross-checked the revenue and net income growth rates from Seeking Alpha. We also considered the trailing twelve-month net income and selected stocks that had a trailing twelve-month net income of more than $500 million. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders in Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\nStory Continues\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n5 Year Revenue Growth: 62.43%\n5 Year Net Income Growth: 92.10%\nTTM Net Income: $53.01 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leader when it comes to AI infrastructure. Previously its Gaming Processing Units (GPUs), revolutionized the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. At present its GPUs are powering the AI infrastructure from computers to data centers, autonomous driving vehicles, and robots.\nWhile the Gaming segment engine of the company is still running, its application in the data center industry has shifted gears for the company. The company has grown to become the best extremely profitable stock to buy now. It has grown its revenue by 62% and net income by 92% over the past 5 years. Whereas, its trailing twelve-month net income stands at an impressive $53.01 billion.\nTo cater to the growing needs of data centers and artificial intelligence, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) launched its Hopper platform in September 2022, which is a GPU architecture designed to handle high-performance computing. Currently, the Hopper platform demand for data centers is leading the company. During the third quarter results for fiscal 2025, total revenue of $35.1 billion for the company was driven by record year-over-year Data Center revenue growth of 112%.\nThe Data Center segment witnessed its H200 GPU sales increase to double-digit billions of dollars, which the management categorized as the fastest product ramp-up in its history. Moreover, its latest Blackwell platform architecture is also in full production and management anticipates its demand for Blackwell and Hopper platform will continue to increase due to their effective use cases in the artificial intelligence industry.\nColumbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe fund held an underweight position in\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA\u2019s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA\u2019s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA\u2019s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company\u2019s revenue, which presents added risk.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of best extremely profitable stocks to buy now.

Since then, the cryptocurrency has marginally pulled back but is still trading above $95,500 and on track to hit a new milestone.\nThe Bitcoin rally that started in 2023 came to an abrupt halt in the second quarter. However, it rebounded in September after the Federal Reserve announced the first interest rate cut. The recent rally is fueled by optimism surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s win in the U.S. presidential election.

The cryptocurrency hit an intraday low of $90,770 on Wednesday, as investors took time to reassess the regulatory relaxation anticipated from Trump when he takes office in January 2025.\nHowever, some favorable developments in the regulatory landscape and upbeat market sentiment saw the cryptocurrency rebounding in the past 24 hours, indicating that the post-election rally is far from over. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has gained 2.6%.\nThroughout his campaign, Trump promised to transform the United States into the \"crypto capital of the planet,\" with plans to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve and appoint regulators who back digital assets. Trump's supportive stance on cryptocurrency, along with reports suggesting his team is considering former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo for a \"Crypto Czar\" position, has boosted optimism in the market.\nAlso, the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting revealed on Tuesday that the central bank plans to go for more rate cuts, although \u201cgradually\u2019, which will further help cryptocurrencies.

          "whole_article": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock lost 10% since the chipmaker posted its third-quarter earnings report last week. Here is what happened:\nAnalysts note that the stock has had some post-earnings reactions. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reported impressive quarterly results with sales of $35 billion, a 94% year-over-year growth. Its data center business grew even faster, surging 112% due to robust AI demand. Net profit doubled to $20 billion, and the company also provided a robust outlook for the current quarter, slightly beating Wall Street expectations. Looking at the numbers, initial slips in the stock could have been some profit-taking. After all, the stock has roughly tripled this year.\nWhy NVDA Stock Lost 10% in One Week\nThen again, the outlook was good, but not great. The company forecasted revenue of $37.5 billion for the fourth quarter, plus or minus 2 percent, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $37.09 billion according to data compiled by LSEG. While the rate of growth is still remarkable, it is clearly a slowdown from previous quarters. The fourth quarter forecast indicates year-to-year growth of about 70% from a year earlier, a stark decline from the 265% annual growth in the year-ago period.\nRevenue, while rising 94% on an annual basis during the quarter that ended on Oct. 27, marks a consecutive slowdown from the previous three quarters where sales rose 122%, 262%, and 265% respectively. Adding to these post-earnings reactions is the market chatter revolving around a potential China trade war. On November 25, President-elect Donald Trump said he would be imposing big tariffs on goods coming from China, Canada, and Mexico on the first day he takes office.\nTrump, who will be taking office on January 20, separately outlined \"an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs\" on imports from China, reports Reuters. Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon, who covers Nvidia and the semiconductor industry, told clients in a note:\n\"Should they come to pass, the direct impact of these new tariffs on semiconductors would be very small as imports of 'raw semiconductors' into the U.S. from these affected countries are tiny\u201d. But he also said, \"escalation remains the larger potential worry as overall semiconductor imports (from all countries) might be large enough to be affected by more broad-based actions should the new administration feels so inclined.\"\nWhen asked about the potential tariffs and their impact on Nvidia, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company will comply with any regulation that comes along, fully. While the exact impact of the tariffs on Nvidia is unclear, new tariffs would indeed raise barriers to trade and most likely cause problems for Nvidia's supply chain.\nStory Continues\nTo add to these woes, Dell Technologies (DELL), a major Nvidia customer and partner, is facing a big drop in its stock price after its earnings report on Tuesday, November 26th. Despite server orders hitting a record high, Dell forecasts lower server sales for the fourth quarter since enterprise customers are waiting to get their hands on new systems powered by Nvidia Corp.\u2019s next-generation Blackwell graphics processing unit chips.\nAs a result, they are shifting to later orders, implying some of them won\u2019t be reflected in the current quarter. Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chips won\u2019t go on sale until early next year. Lastly, Nvidia's stock decline may be partly influenced by lower trading activity, as traders appear to be winding down ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.\nJim Cramer isn't concerned though. We summarized his NVDA thoughts yesterday here. According to Cramer, nothing is wrong. After all, we just saw the numbers, and they were great. The growing skepticism around the slowing rate of growth, increased competition, and the concern that investors are probably going to get less bang for their buck is misleading. There isn't competition from companies such as Amazon, which makes some of its chips to meet specific needs considering Nvidia doesn't have enough manufacturing capacity to meet demand and that's why the company's revenue will keep going up.\nOur research director shared his views on NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Please refer to the disclaimer on slide 2 within the accompanying presentation. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Dan Roberts.\nDaniel Roberts\nThanks Lincoln. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. Thank you for dialing in. It's an interesting time in the market, and we're pleased to have the opportunity to present both our results from the prior quarter. But also importantly, step you through how we're thinking about the short-term as well as the medium and long term.\nSo it's an exciting time for us, exciting time for the industry. So let's dive into it. So jumping straight through to slide 3, make sure everyone's read the disclaimer on slide 2.\nSo I think it's fair to say that the Bitcoin mining sector is reaching an inflection point. It's a very dynamic time in the market, and we fielded a number of questions around why miners are underperforming the price of Bitcoin over the recent months.\nAnd what we're seeing is institutional interest returning to the space. But the question around, why isn't miners necessarily or why aren't they necessarily moving Bitcoin given it's meant to be some sort of proxy exposure, what's different this cycle. So from our perspective, we are seeing that the sector has matured. There are more ways for investors to express interest in Bitcoin. Miners that built their business around a hole strategy now have more competition than ever for that business model.\nYou're seeing institutional grade self-custody solutions. You're seeing the emergence of the ETFS. You're seeing companies like MicroStrategy accumulate Bitcoin through capital market products. In contrast, we're positioned as a low cost commodity producer, focused on cash on cash returns for our investors and producing Bitcoin at low cash cost. Circa $29,000 per Bitcoin as we'll see in the coming slides.\nSo mining business models are under scrutiny. This is an environment in which we expect a low cost, strong cash flow business to thrive. So as you can see, they're on the right hand side, business fundamentals, they're coming into focus production costs, operational, focus, capital allocation, and the outlook for growth. We believe we're well positioned for market leadership in every aspect although and ultimately, we view Bitcoin mining as Gold Mining 2.0.\nCould I just ask that other speakers on the line from our side? Go on mute, please. There's a bit of background noise. Thank you. So if we could then move to slide 4. It's also an inflection point for our business, 31 exahash is weeks away.\nIn fact, I believe that the last miner is going to be delivered in the next seven days. Installation commissioning will take a little bit longer than that. But the 31 exahash is now weeks away making us one of the largest listed miners. Just as Bitcoin is hitting an all-time high, however, those that know us, we're not stopping there.\nWe are also pleased to announce that we are accelerating our expansion to 50 exahash into the first half of next year, previously it was the second half. So we've been able to bring all that forward and continuing to invest to generate more Bitcoin at an expected cash cost of $29,000 per coin.\nThe fundamentals of our business model have allowed us to continue to accelerate growth at low cost. Our strategy focusing on large scale projects continuing to provide a lower execution risk in a rapid platform to expand. Years of planning and procuring long lead items to mitigate supply chain risks, and finally our management capability to deliver. If we have set a target in the market, we hit it, and we will continue to do that.\nThis is a business model now, and this is a business in IREN, where we believe we've hit that inflection point, we've hit the economies of scale now. While we will talk more on unit economics over the coming slides at 31 exahash, we expect to be producing Bitcoin at an all in cash cost of $29,000 per coin.\nWith those economics and those unit economics only to improve as we scale as power costs and operating leverage really start to kick in. In relation to AI and HPC, we've got almost 2000 GPUs now operating combination of H100, H200, both NVIDIA generations. We're focused on contracting out this capacity and looking for opportunities to grow in a measured way based on robust contractual arrangements and demand that we're seeing in the market.\nIn respect to AI co-location and other monetization opportunities, they're also being progressed in parallel. We have high quality assets that we believe will remain valuable in a power constrained market with increasing competition from both Bitcoin mining and AI for this land and power.\nWe will continue not to provide guidance on specific terms or timing, given the uncertainties, given the nature that we are dealing with counterparties, it is not all within our control. However, we continue to progress negotiations with some very large counterparties and hyperscalers. We will update the market as appropriate and as we have news.\nIn terms of what is within our control, as we know the majority of the new generation Blackwell's from NVIDIA, those GPUs will require liquid cooling. So notwithstanding successful testing of our GPU clusters in free cooling environments, including at Childress, we will also be installing our liquid cooling infrastructure at both our Prince George and Childress data centers in the coming months to ensure we are ready to support this next generation of GPUs.\nThis creates opportunities for the business both across our cloud platform, as well as our co-location pathway in terms of corporate and funding initiatives. So in terms of funding, it's clear to say market conditions have improved materially over recent months, more funding options are emerging beyond the ATM.\nWe are focused, very focused on alternative funding instruments as part of funding our upcoming growth plans, for example, convertibles, and we'll continue to progress that over the coming months. In terms of becoming a US domestic issuer, we intend to transition to this status in 2025, reporting on a US GAAP basis.\nWe have also been working on potential inclusion in major US indices, for example, the Russell 2000 in the near term, given the majority of our assets are in the US. Finally, our increased scale at 31 exahash and not long after that 50 exahash combined with our non-hoddle approach i.e. we don't hold Bitcoin on our balance sheet. We mine at an expected all in cash costs of $29,000.\nIt's anticipated to generate very substantial operating cash flows in the near term. As such, we believe this will support potential investor distributions in 2025. We're working through specific details around what that might look like, however, we wish to again signal our commitment, and our focus on prudent capital management and generating strong cash on cash shareholder returns.\nSo moving along to slide 6, a little bit more about Bitcoin mining. So where we're at, we have been delivering consistent growth over the last couple of years. If we set a target, we have met it. We're now at 21 exahash above the 20 exahash previously guided and 31 exahash is just weeks away as I mentioned earlier. We're not stopping there, we are continuing 50 exahash in the first six months of next year.\nSo we are committed to hitting these targets. We will maintain our disciplined approach to delivery. Our focus on costs, our focus on safety. It's supported by our single site expansion at Childress where we have over 400 people on site who will continue the cadence of building out 50 megawatts of data centers every month.\nNo M&A is required, it's all organic growth at cost. The land in Childress cost us a few million dollars. That is it. Everything has been self-developed internally by our team. Proven people, proven delivery processes, and the strategy to focus on large scale projects continues to provide lower execution risk, more certainty and a platform that allows us to rapidly expand at low cost.\nOn the mining hardware side, you'll recall that we previously secured minor purchase options for S21 Pro miners at a fixed price of $18.90, these options were struck when Bitcoin was 65,000. It's taken the last six years to get our platform up to this stage.\nThe vision to accumulate organic development of large scale sites, building a team and know how raising capital we've now hit that inflection point, just as we are seeing, the real world really start to lag the digital world.\nThere is significant megawatts, significant minors, significant capital, and management expertise required from this point for the network i.e. the hashrate at a global level to scale in parallel with the Bitcoin price. Against this backdrop, there's now increasing competition for a number of those inputs, transformers, land, power with the AI traditional data center world. Now also competing for exactly the same core inputs.\nTo play this out with a simple thought exercise, what happens if Bitcoin moves up to 150,000? 50%? All of a sudden, you need another 7,000 megawatts of additional capacity, another $9 billion in CapEx. Transformers, long lead items, cables, networking, concrete steel, all these things that take time that are fraught with risk.\nAll of it to bring into the real world, real projects, real data centers, the ASIC, you cannot plug an ASIC into a high voltage transmission line, it just doesn't work. So we've set ourselves up to really become a leading force in Bitcoin mining. On slide 7 to really drill into this $29,000 cash cost per Bitcoin. We have driven it down, it is happening.\nBest in class efficiency at 15 joules per terahash from 22 in the recent September quarter. Expansion at low power cost. Childress, our average power cost is a tick over $0.03 since moving the spot price with our automated curtailment algorithm a few months ago, that is becoming a larger and larger proportion of our portfolio, driving down our average power cost accordingly.\nAnd then overheads nonpower costs, but all in cost of our business, we're really starting to see the benefits of operating leverage come through. We'll talk more to this on coming slides, but it's effectively spreading our corporate cost base across a much larger number of exahash a much larger number of expected Bitcoin mined.\nSo finally, in terms of operating efficiency, we believe in building high quality data centers that optimize operating conditions for our miners. It's really important to us that we maintain the highest levels of uptime and look after that fleet to maximize profitability.\nMoving on to slide 8, illustrative mining economics. Some of you would have seen this on Twitter previously but one exahash of operating capacity costs are in approximately $30 million to deliver. Against a market backdrop where capital markets are valuing that at almost four times that valuation, $120 million. If you have the ability to deliver at $30 million to have something valued at $120 million, that in my simple mind, that makes a lot of sense to continue pursuing.\nWe see investing in additional capacity as highly accretive. It's a really simple framework for thinking about this, the unit economics to crosscheck that in terms of cash flow, $13 million of net illustrative adjusted EBITDA on a $30 million CapEx, it's around a two-year payback again, making a lot of sense.\nSo as we're looking all in cost to produce, you'll notice on the right hand side, a step up in renewable energy certificate costs as we continue expanding at Childress, this highlights our commitment to 100% renewable energy.\nWe're seeing the sustainability focus really come to the fore. There are lots of different claims out in the market around supporting renewables. At Childress, notwithstanding, 80% of the network in that area is renewable, you need the certificates. If you do not have certificates, you are not operating with renewable energy.\nAt the moment, a wind farm or a solar farm evacuates power into the grid, the commodity is bifurcated into two components. One is the electron that trades alongside black and brown power, the other is the certificate. If you do not buy those certificates, you are not renewable because someone else will own those certificates, and we'll be double counting it.\nSo this has absolutely been a critical part of our strategy, we've bought it for every electron since day one, and we will continue to do that. A key part of how we are also thinking about growth is accretion on a per share basis. How do we drive value for every shareholder in our business?\nOne example of how we're thinking about this is in the bottom right hand table. We've shown this analysis in terms of adjusted EBITDA per share, which highlights very strong accretion metrics as we continue to scale from 31 to 50 exahash.\nWe have also set out some illustrative share price levels at which equity is raised, whether that be through ordinary equity convertibles, or other alternative funding structures. We've seen a number of convertibles launched over recent months with creative strike prices, and we'll continue to look at that as all but one of our pathways to raise additional capital.\nSo yes, growing from $400 million to $700 million of illustrative EBITDA in the top right hand corner is super exciting but more exciting for us, is the creative nature of this growth and our continued commitment to drive cash on cash shareholder returns.\nOn that note, I'd like to pass over to Kent, to talk about AI and HPC.\nStory Continues\nKent Draper\nThanks Dan. With respect to our AI Cloud Service commissioning of our recently acquired NVIDIA H200 GPUs at our Prince George data center Location is now complete. The transition from Bitcoin mining to GPUs was able to be completed in a matter of weeks. Underscoring the multipurpose nature of our data centers, and ability to rapidly scale to support customer growth ambitions.\nNow that capacity is installed, we're focused on contracting out the new capacity and currently have customer trials underway. To that point, we've also been increasing our activity with respect to marketing and go to market initiatives.\nAs an example, in conjunction with the recent Supercompute conference in Atlanta, we hosted roundtable events in San Francisco with commercial leaders in the AI sector and have more a activity planned for the future.\nOur current fleet of NVIDIA H100 H200 GPUs supports approximately $32 million of potential annualized hardware profits using less than 2.5 megawatts of data center capacity. To put that into perspective, that's less than 0.5% of our total year end data center capacity.\nThis is one of the elements that we particularly like about the cloud services offering. It's highly complementary to our existing operations and doesn't cannibalize our data center capacity for other use cases such as AI colocation.\nOur strategy is to continue focusing on measured growth of our capacity in response to customer demand backed by good contracts and solid utilization of that capacity. In relation to colocation and other monetization opportunities, we believe that we have high quality assets which will become more and more valuable in an increasingly power constrained market, and as Dan referred to earlier, there's increasing competition for sites to support both Bitcoin mining and AI.\nWe expect competition for large scale grid connected power to intensify over the coming months, given some of the dynamics in the market including continued growth and adoption of AI regulatory complexities with behind the meter solutions. So for example, the recent FERC rejection of the AWS-Talen interconnect at the Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and also the timeline for new nuclear generation and other generation sources to come online.\nAs a result, we're seeing West Texas sites increasingly coming into focus, and there have been several hyperscaler projects announced in the region in recent months. For example, the Crusoe data center project in Abilene. With respect to our discussions underway, we continue to advance negotiations with interested parties on a range of structures for our sites, including powered land leases and built to suit contracts.\nAs Dan mentioned, we aren't providing guidance on terms or timing at this stage, but as we've said previously, we're actively negotiating potential transactions with hyperscalers and we'll update the market on material developments as appropriate. Monetizing our data center platform into new verticals remains a key focus for management.\nWe're committed to maximizing shareholder value and any transaction must reflect the strategic value of our assets. With respect to liquid cooling, our team has extensive experience designing and operating data centers optimized for power dense compute and a demonstrated execution capability. We're leveraging that experience to best position our infrastructure for opportunities in the rapidly evolving AI sector.\nFor instance, as many people will be aware, certain variants of the Blackwell generation of NVIDIA GPUs require liquid cooling. It's notwithstanding the success and the successful testing of our GPU clusters in our current free air cooling environment, we will be installing liquid cooling infrastructure at both our Prince George and Childress sites to ensure that we're ready to support the next generation of GPUs.\nWe expect this to create additional opportunities for us across both the cloud services and colocation pathways. As we touched on in the previous slide, I'm on slide 12 now, we see significant strategic value in our land and power portfolio and parties are turning their attention to power and capacity requirements for 2026 and beyond.\nToday, we're excited to announce the location of our 1.4 gigawatt Sweetwater Data Center project which is immediately adjacent to the utility's high voltage substation and approximately 60 miles from the regional hub Abilene in West Texas. During the quarter, we've continued to push forward with development activities including securing an additional 800 acres of land adjacent to our existing freehold hold land, bringing our total landholding at the site to over 1,300 acres.\nWe've also accelerated the timeline for upgrades and energization of the utility substation from October 2026 to April 2026. Furthermore, we've commenced procurement to support the 1.4 gigawatt substation energization by April of 2026, including procurement of transformers, circuit breakers, and ancillary electrical equipment at 1,400 megawatts. This single site is larger than many entire data center markets in the US and it has the potential to be the largest Bitcoin mining facility or AI factory in the world, capable of supporting over 90 exahash of Bitcoin mining or over 800,000 GPUs.\nOn to slide 13. In relation to our powerful portfolio, we've spent years developing our current 2.3 gigawatts of contracted capacity. Our approach with respect to the market is only to announce sites where we have executed interconnection agreements.\nThis means they're not potential future megawatts, these are genuine megawatts that are contracted today through binding interconnection agreements. We've observed first hand within our own portfolio, some of the timeline, delays in securing grid approvals. And as Dan mentioned, there are a number of risks associated with development and securing capacity, which underscores the strategic value of having these megawatts contracted today, and especially at large individual sites.\nWithout signed interconnection agreements, the quantum of megawatts timing and cost is highly uncertain. That is why on our calls, we only highlight the 2.3 gigawatts of signed interconnections. However, we continue to develop our data center portfolio and hope to provide updates in due course on our pipeline of over 1 gigawatt of data center sites, if we're successful in signing additional interconnection agreements at those sites.\nImportantly, the interconnection agreements that we have executed provide for uninterruptible power. So that means no mandatory curtailment. Any curtailment that we do is entirely voluntary in order to reduce our power costs at those sites.\nAdditionally, we've continued to invest internally in our development capability including growing our commercial teams at our North American headquarters. And we'll continue to look to accelerate our development activities globally and add to our organic pipeline, which means less reliance on M&A transactions to support our future growth.\nNow I'll pass over to Belinda, our CFO to walk through the financial results.\nBelinda Nucifora\nThank you, Kent. Good morning, to those in Sydney, and good afternoon, to those in North America. Thank you for joining us for our Q1 FY25 earnings update. As a start, I'm going to highlight our operating leverage as we scale our Childress operations.\nEarlier in the presentation, Dan highlighted the illustrative mining economics on our path to 50 exahash. As shown on the slide, as we scale from today's installed capacity of 21 exahash to 50 exahash, we see potential for significant improvement in our unit economics.\nThe group key drivers to this being attractive power prices at Childress with the transition to spot pricing made on August 1, 2024, a reduction in the energy cost per Bitcoin mined across the portfolio due to the increased mining contribution from Childress at a lower cents per kilowatt hour price, coupled with improved fleet efficiency to the industry leading at 15 joules per terahash.\nFurthermore, as we scale overheads are spread over a larger revenue base. As such overheads on a per exahash basis are expected to decrease by approximately 70% from Q1 FY25 as we scale to 50 exahash. This contributes to a significant reduction in our all in cash cost per Bitcoin of approximately $28,000 being the lowest in the industry.\nAs touched on earlier by Dan in the presentation, to finance this growth will be focused on alternative funding instruments. In addition, at scale, the achievement of positive operating cash flows may support a potential for investor distribution in calendar year 2025.\nMoving on to the next slide. Further to the operating leverage we just discussed, this sets out the illustrative economics at various Bitcoin prices. The first column of the table shows illustrative economics at 31 exahash and 50 exahash with a Bitcoin price of $90,000 and a current network hashrate of 732 exahash.\nThis results in an estimated adjusted EBITDA of $435 million and $714 million respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown in the table sets out the illustrative economics associated with Bitcoin prices starting at $125,000 and scaling by 25,000 intervals to $200,000 at an implied network hashrate of 1,000 exahash.\nThis results in adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion at a Bitcoin price of $200,000. The estimated increase in overheads as we scale from 31 exahash to 50 exahash is approximately $23 million, primarily attributable to variable Childress site related costs, including property insurance and property county taxes.\nAlso mentioned earlier, we're 100% committed to renewable energy and our investment in renewable certificate costs increase as we scale from $9 million at 31 exahash to $16 million at 50 exahash. Our overheads reflect a business contributing to deliver significant growth. We have onboarded technical and go-to-market resources for our AI business and have built internal site development expertise to scale our broader portfolio.\nThis makes us less reliant on competitive M&A processes to scale our platform, and we see this as a strategic advantage. Moving on to the next slide, I'll touch on the quarterly results. During the quarter, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million with Bitcoin mining revenue of $54.3 million and AI cloud services revenue of $3.2 million.\nThe average operating hashrate for the quarter increased from 9 exahash to 12.1 exahash and we mined 821 Bitcoin at an average realized price of $66,000. Net electricity costs for the quarter increased by $4.6 million to $28.7 million. This was primarily due to the increased Childress megawatt usage as we scaled as well as the Childress energy procurement in July 2024, which was under a fixed cost, fixed quantity contract.\nFrom August 1, 2024, Childress procurement transitioned to a spot pricing strategy. If that spot pricing strategy had been in place for the entire quarter, the cost of Bitcoin mine would have been $26,700 versus a $35,400.\nAs discussed in the previous slide, other costs of $21.4 million reflects a business today that is delivering significant growth and projected continued expansion over the coming years. The primary driver of the quarter on quarter increase of $0.4 million is due to Childress construction and operational insurance costs.\nNow moving to our cash flows. Closing cash at bank at September 30 is reported as $98.6 million with strong receipts from Bitcoin mining activities of $49.6 million and AI cloud services of $3.7 million. The increase in electricity payments made during the quarter includes the one off liquidation payment of $7.2 million related to the transition to spot pricing strategy from August 1, 2024.\nWe increased our investing activities and spent a total of $387 million, which relates to expansion at Childress data center, the purchase of Bitmain S21 Pros and T21 Miners as part of the pathway to the 31 exahash and the purchase of NVIDIA H200 GPUs.\nWe raised $84 million of net ATM proceeds during the quarter and post that $142 million from net ATM proceeds. Cash increased to $182.4 million at October 31, 2024. We'll now turn to the balance sheet. At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of $1.3 billion, no debt and a strong balance sheet providing flexibility to fund future growth.\nTotal equity increased to $1.1 billion with gross proceeds of $76 million from 9.1 million shares sold under the ATM. As touched on earlier in the presentation by Dan, to finance future growth, we'll be focused on alternative funding instruments and in addition, at scale, the achievement of positive operating cash flows may support a potential for investor distribution in calendar year 2025.\nI'll now turn over for Q&A.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nLucas Pipes, B. Riley Securities.\nLucas Pipes\nThank you very much, operator, and good day everyone. My first question is on Sweetwater, and how you think about the strategic process versus the organic opportunity at the site? Thank you very much for your perspective on that.\nDaniel Roberts\nThanks, Lucas. Nice to see you. Look, the short answer is there's no decision point right now beyond procuring long lead items around the electrical infrastructure, so transformers, substation components, et cetera. So we're in a position to prepare dual pathways, both for Bitcoin mining as well as AI related opportunities on the colocation or otherwise.\nSo we're pursuing it in all parallel. And the reality is we're facing a number of different potential pathways. And the opportunity is to compare each pathway to each other as an opportunity cost. And it's everything from building out Bitcoin mining.\nAnd if we can continue to build at $30 million and have the market value that exahash at $120 million, then that sounds pretty good. All the way through to build to suit options where we might build an AI data center for a counterparty under a build to suit model.\nAnd again, internally deliver a component of that. There's structures like power and land, leases in there as well. So at this stage, it's working through all the options in parallel and just playing them off against each other.\nLucas Pipes\nI appreciate that. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on the capital intensity on the Bitcoin mining business. Should we kind of think of that $30 million per exahash in a linear fashion up to 50? And if so, could you just remind us what the capital requirement is from where you are today to that 50 exahash ? How much capital is needed? Thank you very much for calling.\nDaniel Roberts\nYes, for sure. So we haven't guided a specific number, partly because there's a number of moving parts around do we buy additional GPUs, because there's a spike in demand and the customer would like that. We're buying long lead items for Sweetwater.\nBut if we look in really high level terms, we previously announced that we were fully funded to the 30 exahash. Since then, we've raised about $200 million-ish under the ATM, that gives a $400 million funding requirement to go from 30 to 50.\nYes, we've had higher operating cash flows than expected because of the Bitcoin price action. But again, that's somewhat offset by other CapEx. So we haven't guided specific numbers, but in general terms, you can probably triangulate roughly what we need.\nLucas Pipes\nDan and team. I really appreciate all the color, and wish you best of luck. Thank you.\nDaniel Roberts\nThank you.\nOperator\nJoseph Vafi, Canaccord Genuity.\nJoseph Vafi\nEveryone, good morning. Nice to see all the progress on so many fronts. It's great. Just kind of starting with a theoretical one, we've got a much higher Bitcoin spot price than we did, and you're now mentioning potential. It sounds like maybe a dividend or something like that next year. Just wondering at what Bitcoin level and kind of what level of exahash do you think at least the Bitcoin business can keep growing kind of more on a self-funded basis moving forward versus balance sheet related financing? And then I'll have a quick follow up.\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, sure. So we think about operating cash flows a little bit separate to investing cash flows where there are two separate decision points in our mind. So the first is operating cash profits. So how much are you generating from your operations as a going concern, and what do we do with that cash flow. The second is what is the decision around reinvestment of those cash flows.\nNow, I think it's fair to say that for quite some time, 100% of all the capital we raise is going into revenue generating CapEx and using our operations to continue to support building our corporate overheads, our operating base, et cetera. And as you can see in the presentation, we're now hitting that inflection point where operating cash flows are going to be potentially substantial.\nSo the decision to reinvest those cash flows as distinct from distributing those cash flows to investors is something that we'll work through. But when you look at the market today and you see a number of different companies accumulating Bitcoin on their balance sheet, paying market price or close thereof to it, and we've got the opportunity to generate Bitcoin and effectively acquire Bitcoin at a cash cost of $29,000 and distribute that Bitcoin/cash out to investors who can then self-custody.\nWe're not that big of believers in third party custody. We've been around Bitcoin since 2013, ridden Mt. Gox, FTX, et cetera. So I think the opportunity to generate a $29,000 cash cost Bitcoin for investors and effectively distribute that coin out either through the physical coin, we'll have to look into that, or as cash flow is pretty powerful.\nAnd I think it's important to keep that separate from investing in cash flows and how we might fund that to continue to drive that cost potentially down even lower, but drive it in aggregate.\nJoseph Vafi\nThat's great color. And potentially exciting there in actually distributing the underlying Bitcoin instead of cash. And then just congrats on being able to announce the Sweetwater site. That's nice progress. Just, I know you started to talk about some long lead time items there. Are you going to try to get enough long lead time items for the full 1.4 gigawatts or do you think that there's a step progress there? And then any update on fiber and if you're going to have to invest on fiber interconnect for that site? Thanks a lot.\nKent Draper\nDan. I'm happy to jump in and take that one. So with respect to the full capacity there on the data center side, it will take some time to build it out. As Dan referred to earlier, we're currently at Childress able to build out about 50 megawatts a month in terms of data center capacity. So to build out a site the size of the Sweetwater data center site, it will take some period of time.\nBut what we're doing with the procurement of long lead items is enabling the full capacity on the high voltage substation. So this is the substation that allows you to connect into the high voltage utility grid. And then we will build out the remaining site substations and data center capacity on a progressive basis. But the long lead procurement is set up in a way to enable us to energize the entire bulk high voltage substation to the full capacity on that April 2026 timeline.\nJoseph Vafi\nGreat. Thanks Kent. And then any update on fiber at Sweetwater. Thanks a lot guys.\nKent Draper\nYes. So in terms of fiber, there are multiple Tier 1 carriers in the area, including right up to the existing utility substation. So access to fiber is not an issue. In terms of latency, because these are Tier 1 providers, the latency to all major hyperscaler hubs is very good as well. So sub 20 milliseconds latency and sub 10 milliseconds in a number of cases. So the fiber position at that site is suitable for almost all AI applications, as well as Bitcoin mining, obviously.\nJoseph Vafi\nSure. That's all positive news. Thanks for that color, Kent.\nOperator\nDarren Aftahi, Roth.\nDarren Aftahi\nHi guys. Good morning. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I may. First, I'm just curious, strategically, can you walk through just the mindset of accelerating the 50 exahash in the context of maybe looking at opportunity costs relative to other opportunities?\nAnd then my second question on your balance sheet, the $275 million of prepayment on the cash flow, what is that exactly related to in terms of payments? I assume it's all for the acceleration to 50 exahash. And I guess like what portion of that CapEx is already paid for? Thanks.\nDaniel Roberts\nI'll pass over to Belinda for the balance sheet question in a minute. But to address the first question around opportunity cost, I mean, we continue to have conversations with very large counterparties about the prospects of doing a deal at Childress.\nBut the reality is you've got to make a decision at some point, and the decision is right this second, the preference is to build out Bitcoin mining. The opportunity cost is comparing each pathway to another. Yes, we've received multiple offers for capacity there. But in our opinion at this stage, the prospects and the risk return proposition of building all that out at Bitcoin makes sense.\nEqually, there's still some optionality there. We haven't exercised all those minor options. We've got some time to do that. So if those contractual negotiations with other parties went a slightly different direction or improved, then, I mean, we reserve the right to change our mind and pivot. But by definition, it needs to be better than the alternative which we can control, which is building out Bitcoin mining at $30 million and having the market seemingly value that at $120 million.\nBelinda Nucifora\nThank you, Darren. Yeah. In relation to the prepayments, so we've got mining hardware prepayments of $122 million as well as on the GPUs $8.1 million. We also in our Childress new contract, we have to keep some collateral on Board, so we have some prepayments in relation to the electricity contract in Childress.\nDarren Aftahi\nGreat. Appreciate all the insights. Thank you.\nOperator\nReggie Smith, JPMorgan.\nReggie Smith\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question, or good morning rather out in Australia. You had a really interesting quote in your press release, and you actually mentioned it again during the call. Some of the effect of making sure that a deal reflected the value of your assets, strategic value of the assets, I think, was the exact quote.\nI'm not asking for a number, but I'm curious how you guys go about appraising the value of that, like how you think about it. We've tried to take some stabs at it, but I'm just curious how you think about that. And I have a follow up. Thank you.\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah. Thanks, Reggie. To be honest, it's a bit of art and science, both hand in hand. The science element is putting the numbers down and modeling out the various pathways and scenarios. You've got Bitcoin mining and then you've got various AI colocation structures that all result essentially in an NPV valuation to the business today. So that's the science.\nNotwithstanding, you've got to put assumptions into those spreadsheets, but those assumptions are informed largely by reality. When it comes to Bitcoin mining, it's CapEx, it's returns, Bitcoin price, network hash rate.\nWhen it comes to AI transactions, it's plugging in contractual terms that are under negotiation. So it's quite easy in terms of working out at any point in time what the preference might be. Notwithstanding there's assumptions that go into that, including discount rates, cost of capital, market valuation of different types of revenue streams. So all of that goes into the bucket.\nThe art element is saying, well, where are we at in the market? What are the conversations we're having with market participants all the way from hyperscalers to data centers, to the banks, to real estate companies, and triangulating all that information to try and form some sort of directional view on where the market is at.\nAnd I think it's fair to say that the market is still in transition. You've gone from the old world of effectively available capital, available data center capacity to increase the number of GPUs and meet this AI demand. All of a sudden, you seem to have hit this point in the market where hang on, we are short potentially substantial amounts of power to meet this.\nI think it's absolutely fair to say there's a transition period where every counterparty is going on their own journey around how scarce is power, how real is the current demand on the AI side? And what does this mean in terms of capacity to pay an interest in transacting in a specific valuation point.\nAnd as time goes on, what we're seeing, again, this is anecdotes, is people are now starting to realize the 1 and 0 difference between having an interconnection agreement and talking about this made up pipeline of megawatts.\nI mean, we have been in development for decades, renewable energy projects through to other infrastructure to now developing power for data centers, as we've done in IREN. It is a 1 and 0 business. You could have whatever made up pipeline of megawatts you want. But unless you get to the finish line and you get that signed connection agreement, it is worth 0, absolutely nothing.\nIn sporting terms, the analogy is going through a home and away season, undefeated, not losing the game, being the hot price favorite, you then get to the final. You have a few injuries, the weather changes, something else goes wrong and you don't win the final or you've lost. It's a 0. The season counts for nothing and you go on to the next season. It is exactly the same in this. And I think the market is now starting to realize the value of that.\nReggie Smith\nThat's good. It actually leads right into my next question. It was going to be about kind of the urgency that you were sensing. And it sounds like you're starting to get that urgency. One of the things that I've noticed is that a lot of these not a lot, but several of these big tech companies have announced long range projects that deliver in 2029, 2030, haven't really seen outside of CoreWeave a deal that's like for more immediate capacity.\nIt sounds like there's more urgency. Maybe can you talk a little bit about how conversations have changed and whether there is more urgency on the front end, post end of kind of capacity and opportunities, how that's changing? Thanks.\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, I mean, two hours ago, we got an email from $1 trillion hyperscaler that said, they weren't interested in Sweetwater, and now they are. I mean, that's one data point. And there's lots of little anecdotes along the way. I'm kind of reluctant to go into too much detail at the risk of building expectations because at the end of the day, a lot of this is outside of our control in terms of how counterparties think about value, their capacity to transact at terms that we will deem attractive.\nSo it's just a matter of working through all that, knowing that we control our own destiny, being a low-cost producer of Bitcoin and generating that strong cash on cash returns with this incredible optionality that we're super excited about around a large scale AI HPC deal that might happen.\nReggie Smith\nThat's fair. I appreciate that. Congrats on the quarter, and good luck. Thank you.\nOperator\nBrett Knoblauch, Cantor Fitzgerald.\nBrett Knoblauch\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Maybe just to start, I think a big news event that happened in the quarter was the FERC announcement. Have you seen like a material increase in demand post that announcement given they kind of used Texas assets much more favorably?\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, I mean, I've got not a lot to add as a follow up to answering the previous questions. I think, yes, like we are seeing more perceived demand coming through. But again, I'll use the sporting analogy. All these conversations are great, but unless you close a deal, it's one's and zeros.\nAnd we're just not in the business of speculating and telling everyone every step of the way how good these negotiations are because unless you get a signature on a piece of paper that delivers a transaction that delivers value for shareholders, then it's worth zero.\nIt's the same in development. It's the same in AI deals. And we can -- you can't really control the time lines of each. You've got to continue to progress things will go wrong, things will go right, but get the signature and then you've created a proper tangible value for your shareholders.\nBrett Knoblauch\nThank you. And then maybe just one more on AI cloud business. I know you guys guided for year end, it being 10% of profits. Obviously, Bitcoin has gone up a lot since then. I guess, what's the plan beyond this year for that business? And how do you view that for CapEx on GPUs relative to maybe some of the Bitcoin mining CapEx given what we've seen happening with Bitcoin over the last couple of weeks?\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, It's a great question and something we think a lot about. I think in the short term, we're probably less disposed to investing CapEx in the GPUs. And that's for two reasons. One is our current cost of capital and where we should be focusing use of funding. And I think when you look at the Bitcoin opportunity, that's very, very clear and tangible.\nGPUs, they are capital intensive. We have explored debt options. Do you want to lay in the business with debt at this point in time in the absence of having a long term contract. Again, things can change quickly, so I'm going to hedge my bets here. But sitting here right here right now with our cost of capital where it is. And also, what we're seeing is a slight weakening of demand in that market.\nIt may be attributable to this change in generations of the NVIDIA chips. We're going from the H100, H200 generation to the Blackwells being released next year, and that will be a reasonably material step up in compute. And I think it's fair to say that we're seeing end customers be a little bit cautious around that and maybe preferring shorter term contracts on the H100 and H200s, in anticipation of those new generations come out. So we just think it's prudent to just take a measured approach.\nIf tonight, we get a contract, a call for a longer term contract, and it's a big opportunity, absolutely, we're going to do it. But right here right now, it feels like it's a little bit more measured, and let's just wait and see how the next few months plays out.\nBrett Knoblauch\nAwesome. And maybe if I could just squeeze in one more. There's been a lot of news over the past couple of weeks surrounding Bitmain, and I know you guys have a big purchase order in place. I guess, are you guys concerned that those shipments could potentially not be delivered or held off at customs or just any thoughts or comments on that?\nDaniel Roberts\nYeah, I mean, for six years, we've had people throw concerns around Bitmain add ups, and I'll just continue to say exactly the same thing. We have never had anything but a fantastic experience with Bitmain. The purchase process, the post market -- the aftermarket.\nIn terms of supply chain hiccups, we deal with it every day. It's the consequence of dealing with a real world business and 1 million and one moving parts, but we've had no material issues. And as I mentioned on the call, I think the last of the 31 exahash in miners will be delivered in the next few, maybe seven days.\nBrett Knoblauch\nAwesome. All appreciate it guys. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Roberts for any closing remarks.\nDaniel Roberts\nThank you, operator. Well, that rounds out our Q1 FY25 results call. We've enjoyed presenting our results, but also articulating our vision in terms of both funding side, looking at alternative structures beyond just the ATM to raise capital on potentially less dilutive terms. But importantly, the ability to invest that capital in accretive projects for our shareholders, looking at per share metrics, for example, adjusted EBITDA as outlined in our presentation and maintaining a prudent approach to capital allocation to generate those strong shareholder returns.\nIt's a consequence of long-term planning in this business to get it to this point, years of developing sites organically, years of planning and procurement of long lead items. And we feel that the mining sector as a whole as well as our business are at an inflection point. And over the next three to six months, we'll see that start to play out in even more tangible terms, and we're excited to position ourselves as a market leader in this area.\nSo thank you, everyone, for dialing in, and have a good evening.\nOperator\nThank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. The report adds that these workers complete projects for internal business units at the ride hailing company but are also serving outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic. The company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the US, Canada, and India, among others.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOver the past few years, even though the firm is yet to launch an eye-catching AI product, it has incorporated AI internally to streamline operations. For example, the AI algorithms of the firm efficiently match riders with drivers to minimize waiting times and maximize driver utilization. These algorithms predict demand, analyze traffic patterns, and estimate trip durations to offer real-time ride assignments. Similarly, the company heavily invests in AI for self-driving car technology.

          "whole_article": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Alphabet (GOOGL). Shares have lost about 3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Alphabet due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nAlphabet Q3 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates, Up Y/Y\nAlphabet\u2019s third-quarter 2024 earnings of $2.12 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.85%.

The figure missed the consensus mark by 1.82%.\nStory Continues\nGOOGL\u2019s Operating Margin Expands Y/Y\nCosts and operating expenses were $59.747 billion, up 7.9% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, the figure declined 450 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe operating margin was 32.3%, which expanded 450 bps year over year.\n\nSegment-wise, Google Services\u2019 operating margin of 40.3% expanded 510 bps year over year.\n\nGoogle Cloud\u2019s operating income was $1.947 billion compared with $266 million reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOther Bets reported a loss of $1.116 billion compared with a loss of $1.194 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nAlphabet\u2019s Balance Sheet Remains Strong\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $93.23 billion, down from $100.7 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\nLong-term debt was $12.297 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024 compared with $13.24 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAlphabet generated $30.698 billion of cash from operations in third-quarter 2024 compared with $26.6 billion in second-quarter 2024. GOOGL spent $13.061 billion on capital expenditure, netting a free cash flow of $17.637 billion in the reported quarter.\n\nSolid liquidity is helping Alphabet maintain its dividend payout. In third-quarter 2024, GOOGL paid $2.5 billion in dividends and bought back shares worth $15.3 billion. Over the trailing 12 months, Alphabet has returned $70 billion to shareholders.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nSince the earnings release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.\nVGM Scores\nAt this time, Alphabet has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Put into numerical terms, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index, which features many of the AI sector\u2019s major names, has added nearly 30% for this year to date \u2013 on top of the 43% gains it registered last year.\nDon't Miss our Black Friday Offers:\nUnlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF!\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\nThe significance of AI, both as a technological force and an investment opportunity, is underscored by the attention it\u2019s garnering from Wall Street titans \u2013 the billionaire investors who\u2019ve made fortunes betting on the right trends.\nSteve Cohen, the founder and CEO of Point72, is among them. Drawing parallels between the current AI boom and the tech revolution of the 1990s, Cohen views AI not as a speculative bubble but as a \u2018really durable\u2019 phenomenon poised to reshape industries and markets.\nMore importantly, Cohen is willing to put his money where his mouth is, and is reportedly preparing to set up a new billion-dollar hedge fund to focus on AI stocks. In the meantime, his main firm, Point72, is already betting heavily on AI, and has opened new positions in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), two of the industry\u2019s leaders.\nAccording to the data from TipRanks, both AMD and GOOGL feature Strong Buy consensus ratings and double-digit upside potential for the coming year. Let\u2019s give them a closer look, and find out just why billionaire investor Steve Cohen is loading up on these two big AI stocks.\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nFirst up is AMD, a leading innovator in the semiconductor chip industry \u2013 and a company that is angling to challenge the chip giant Nvidia for a larger slice of the AI pie. While AMD is not in the same trillion-dollar league as the market leader Nvidia \u2013 its market cap of ~$229 billion ranks it sixth among its peers \u2013 the company has built up a solid business for itself, putting a wide range of top-end PC processor and AI-capable accelerator chips on the market.\nAmong AMD\u2019s leading products are several newly announced chips and chipsets, including the Ryzen 7 9800X3D desktop processor, optimized for high-end gaming uses; the Versal Premium Series Gen 2, designed to improve data movement efficiency and to unlock more memory storage in data-intensive markets; and the Instinct MI300A APU, the market\u2019s second exascale accelerator, designed to power the fastest-ever supercomputer. Whatever the immediate application, the common denominator in all of these is AI \u2013 AMD\u2019s newest chips have the speed and capacity to handle data-heavy workloads.\nStory Continues\nThat\u2019s by design, of course. AMD has strong relationships, based on its AI-capable chips, with such powerful industry names as Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. With its new product offerings, AMD is aiming to expand its role in the global AI market, which the data aggregation site Statista estimates will reach $92 billion in total revenue by the end of 2025.\nSteve Cohen evidently thinks AMD will be a major player in the field. During Q3, Point72 opened a new position in AMD. The billionaire hedge manager picked up 871,731 shares of the stock, a holding that is worth over $120 million at the current share price.\nAt the end of last month, AMD reported its results for 3Q24. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue was strong, beating the forecast by $110 million and growing more than 17% year-over-year to reach $6.82 billion. Earnings, reported as a non-GAAP EPS, came to 92 cents per share, in-line with expectations, and up 31% from the prior year.\nDespite the gains in earnings, shares in AMD are down 17% since the quarterly results were released. While the results were good, investors were disappointed with the firm\u2019s Q4 guidance, which predicted $7.5 billion at the midpoint to the revenue range, below the $7.55 billion that analysts had expected.\nFor TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter, however, the decline in share price creates an opening to buy. Buchalter sums up his bullish view of this stock, writing, \u201cWe view AMD\u2019s forward roadmap and progress on building its networking ecosystem reinforcing our confidence it can create and capture value in AI computing. Against a very large and still early AI compute TAM, we believe AMD is well on the way to cementing its position as the de facto merchant alternative to NVIDIA\u2019s leadership position.\u201d\nThe analyst follows this with a Buy rating on the stock, and adds a $185 price target that indicates potential for a 34% gain in the next 12 months. (To watch Buchalter\u2019s track record, click here)\nThe 30 recent analyst reviews on AMD break down 23-to-7 in favor of Buy over Hold, giving the shares their consensus rating of Strong Buy. The $137.72 trading price and $185.46 average target price together imply a potential one-year upside of 34.5%. (See AMD stock forecast)\nAlphabet\nNow we\u2019ll turn to Alphabet, the parent company of the internet\u2019s leading search engine, Google, and leading video platform, YouTube. Through these subsidiaries, Alphabet holds the world-leading position in the field of internet search \u2013 but more importantly, the company has access to a treasure trove of raw data, the feedstock of AI applications. While the online advertising business based on that data trove has pushed Alphabet to a market cap over $2 trillion, making it the fifth-largest publicly traded firm on Wall Street, it\u2019s the company\u2019s AI bent that is more likely to propel it into the future.\nAlphabet already makes use of AI to improve results from its search engines, both Google and YouTube, using the tech to offer search suggestions and to target relevant ads to web surfers. Precise ad targeting is key, as Alphabet\u2019s revenue stream comes mainly from its online advertising segment.\nIn addition to its uses in web search and digital advertising, AI is essential to Alphabet\u2019s online translation capabilities. AI-powered large language models (LLMs) allow the company to conduct its ad business around the world in the audiences\u2019 native tongues, and to offer automated translation services that expand users\u2019 horizons to websites outside of their native languages.\nAll of this builds into Alphabet\u2019s Gemini platform, the company\u2019s purpose-built, customer-facing, generative AI platform. Alphabet\u2019s platform is already working with large language models, and can even help users with complex tasks such as computer coding. Alphabet is working to expand Gemini into all of its products \u2013 but especially into its Android smartphone operating system. That last will bring a functional AI assistant into the world of smartphone applications, and from there the vistas are endless.\nTurning to Steve Cohen\u2019s recent GOOGL buys, we find that he bought big last quarter \u2013 to the tune of 1,159,225 shares. At the current price, this new position is worth approximately $196 million.\nIn its last quarterly report, for 3Q24, Alphabet\u2019s management stated that the company saw strong success in its core revenue-driving business of online advertising. The company\u2019s ~90% market share in online search provides a strong foundation for the digital ad business. Alphabet\u2019s revenues in the third quarter came to $88.3 billion, growing almost 15% year-over-year and beating the forecast by $2.05 billion. The company\u2019s EPS was also strong, up 37% year-over-year to reach $2.12 per share \u2013 and beating the forecast by 27 cents per share.\nIn coverage for Pivotal Research Group, analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak takes note of Alphabet\u2019s leading position in online search and advertising, as well as the company\u2019s strong business lines in AI and cloud computing. He writes of the internet giant, \u201cIf the status quo holds, GOOG appears to be in a very strong competitive position with a deep moat around their dominant core search business model (~90% market share ex China) and an obvious path to leverage 90%+ (ex China) global device presence (which we believe will dominate consumer AI assistant use), a strong AI platform and financial might to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement. GOOG also holds a strong #3 position in cloud computing, which as evidenced by the 3Q acceleration in revenue growth has dramatic growth potential given still relatively low (15-20%) cloud market share of enterprise workloads (+ benefits from AI), controls the largest video/audio streaming platform in the world (YouTube) and the world\u2019s top browser (Chrome) with a 65% global market share (ex-China).\u201d\nLooking ahead, Wlodarczak puts a Buy rating on GOOGL shares, with a $225 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 33%. (To watch Wlodarczak\u2019s track record, click here)\nThe Strong Buy consensus rating on Alphabet is based on 34 recent Wall Street reviews that favor Buy over Hold by 27 to 7. The shares are priced at $169.12 and the $207.9 average price target points toward a 23% gain in the year ahead.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is asking a federal appeals court to throw out a ruling in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games that would force the search giant to overhaul its Play mobile app store.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIn Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes\nIn Italy\u2019s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing\nNew York City\u2019s \u2018Living Breakwaters\u2019 Brace for Stormier Seas\nGoogle said in a filing Wednesday that US District Judge James Donato\u2019s ruling is mistaken and asked that the outcome of the long-running litigation be set aside.\nFor one thing, Google argued, Donato should have recognized that the company competes with Apple Inc. in the smartphone market, as a different judge found when she concluded that Apple\u2019s conduct toward Epic didn\u2019t violate federal antitrust laws. The judge also erred in holding a trial with a jury last year instead of deciding himself whether Google acted anticompetitively, the company said. Google says Donato\u2019s ruling would force it to do business with rival app stores \u2014 which the company contends it is not legally required to do.\nGoogle\u2019s appeal is \u201cmeritless\u201d and relies on \u201cflawed arguments,\u201d a spokeswoman for Epic said in a statement. \u201cWe will fight to ensure that the jury\u2019s verdict and the court\u2019s injunction are upheld and Google is held to account for its anticompetitive behavior.\u201d\nA San Francisco jury concluded in December 2023 that Google violated antitrust law by blocking rival app stores through a series of revenue-sharing agreements with mobile device makers like Samsung. Following up with a fix in October, Donato ordered Google to allow developers to set up app marketplaces and offer consumers billing options other than its own payment system.\n\u201cThis case involves an extraordinary attempt by a lone competitor to use the federal judiciary to restructure the day-to-day operations of Google\u2019s app store, Google Play, and to unilaterally reshape markets with consequences for millions of non-parties,\u201dGoogle said in its filing. The jury verdict and Donato\u2019s injunction, unless reversed, \u201cwill directly undercut Google\u2019s efforts\u201d to compete against Apple, Google said.\nEpic first sued Google and Apple in August 2020, accusing them of blocking competition for rival app stores. The judge in the Apple case largely ruled against Epic, though she directed the iPhone maker to make some changes to its App Store rules. Epic and Apple are currently fighting in an Oakland federal court over whether the iPhone maker is abiding by that ruling.\nDonato has temporarily put his ruling on hold. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco can extend that delay pending the outcome of Google\u2019s appeal, or force Google to make changes to its business while simultaneously seeking to overturn the ruling.\nStory Continues\nOral arguments are scheduled on Feb. 3 at the Ninth Circuit.\n(Updates with Epic statement in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

The Cary, North Carolina-based company persuaded a San Francisco jury last year that Google illegally stifled competition.\nBased on the jury's findings, U.S. District Judge James Donato ordered Google in October to let users download rival app stores within Play and make Play's app catalog available to those competitors, among other reforms.\nThe order, which would bind Google for three years, is on hold pending review in the 9th Circuit.\nGoogle told the appeals court on Wednesday that a jury should never have heard Epic's lawsuit because it sought to enjoin Google's conduct, not collect damages. It said Donato unfairly allowed Epic to tell jurors that Google and Apple are not competitors for app distribution and in-app payments.\nThe filing said Donato was wrong to issue an injunction affecting users and developers nationwide, not just Epic. Google said the order made Donato \"a central planner responsible for product design.\"\nThe 9th Circuit said it will hear oral arguments on Feb. 3, with a ruling expected later next year.\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by David Bario, Rod Nickel, David Gregorio and Jonathan Oatis)\nView Comments"

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has gone as far as filing a formal complaint with the European Commission, accusing the Redmond-based giant of locking customers into its cloud ecosystem with punitive licensing terms. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., the FTC is taking a hard look at whether Microsoft's AI dominance, fueled by its partnership with OpenAI, gives it an unfair edge. Add to that cybersecurity issueslike a recent massive outage impacting Microsoft systems globallyand the stakes couldn't be higher. Microsoft has long benefited from its role as a top government contractor, but this investigation could shift its trajectory in the booming cloud and AI markets.\nAnd here's the wildcard: politics. President-elect Trump is set to take office in January, and while his administration has historically been tough on Big Tech, Microsoft has seen its fair share of wins under his watchremember that $10 billion Pentagon contract? But with Lina Khan on her way out, there's no guarantee this probe will survive a leadership shakeup. For investors, the big takeaway is this: Microsoft's future in its most profitable sectors is suddenly looking uncertain.

          "whole_article": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\nThe probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.\nThe FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.\nThe FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.\nMicrosoft declined to comment on Wednesday.\nCompetitors have criticized Microsoft's practices they say keep customers locked into its cloud offering, Azure. The FTC fielded such complaints last year as it examined the cloud computing market.\nNetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft's licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.\n\"Given that Microsoft is the world's largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,\" the group said.\nGoogle in September complained to the European Commission about Microsoft's practices, saying it made customers pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators, and gave them later and more limited security updates.\nThe FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.\nThe agency had already claimed jurisdiction over probes into Microsoft and OpenAI regarding competition in artificial intelligence, and started looking into Microsoft's $650 million deal with AI startup Inflection AI.\nMicrosoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators' recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.\nFacebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.\nAlphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google's trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.\nIt is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.\n\"The Trump administration was an aggressive enforcer of the antitrust laws,\" said Andre Barlow, a lawyer with Doyle Barlow & Mazard, noting it filed suits against Google and Facebook.\n\"When administrations change, the agencies do not necessarily drop ongoing investigations,\" he added, noting that \"changes in administration can lead to evolving enforcement priorities and shifts in how aggressively certain types of conduct are scrutinized.\" Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.\nIn 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; additional reporting by Chris Sanders; editing by Jonathan Oatis, Richard Chang, Alistair Bell and Sonali Paul)\nView Comments"

The demand, which is hundreds of pages long, has been sent to the company after FTC Chair Lina Khan signed off, said one of the people.\nFTC antitrust lawyers are set to meet with Microsoft competitors next week to gather more information about the Redmond, Washington-based company\u2019s business practices, according to two other people familiar with the plans who like the others asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.\nMicrosoft and the FTC declined to comment.\nThe FTC\u2019s scrutiny of Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing business gained steam after a string of cybersecurity incidents that involved the company\u2019s products. The company is a top government contractor, providing billions of dollars in software and cloud services to US agencies including the Defense Department.\nThe Microsoft information demand is one of Khan\u2019s parting shots as she steps down after helming one of the most aggressive pushes against consolidated corporate power the agency has delivered in decades. While business leaders are hoping that President-elect Donald Trump will usher in an era of lighter regulation, it will fall to his new FTC chair \u2014 still unnamed \u2014 to decide how to proceed with the case.\nThe FTC inquiry renews scrutiny of Microsoft for its business practices more than 25 years after the government sued the company over similar conduct involving bundling its Windows operating system and browser and unsuccessfully tried to break it up.\nA key focus of the current probe is Microsoft\u2019s bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings, according to the people familiar with the information request.\nMicrosoft\u2019s cybersecurity failings, combined with its heft as a government contractor, are seen by the FTC as an example of the company\u2019s problematic power over the market, those people said.\nIn a November 2023 report, the FTC highlighted concerns that the concentrated nature of the cloud market means that \u201coutages, or other issues that degrade the service of a cloud provider, could have a cascading impact on the economy or specific sectors.\u201d\nStory Continues\nThe CrowdStrike crash that affected millions of devices operating on Microsoft Windows systems earlier this year was itself a testament to the widespread use of the company\u2019s products and how it directly affects the global economy.\nA portion of the probe is focused on the company\u2019s practices related to security software called Microsoft Entra ID \u2014 formerly known as Azure Active Directory \u2014 which helps authenticate users logging in to cloud-based software, some of the people said.\nCompetitors have complained that Microsoft\u2019s licensing terms and bundling of software with cloud services makes it harder for rival authentication and cybersecurity companies to compete.\nCompanies such as Salesforce Inc.\u2019s Slack and Zoom Communications Inc. have said that Microsoft\u2019s practice of giving away its Teams video-conferencing software for free in a bundle with popular software products like Word and Excel is anticompetitive and makes it harder for them to compete.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Or both.\nMy advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.\nHere are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you\u2019re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.\nVideo games\nVideo games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You\u2019ll find deals on consoles including Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo\u2019s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I\u2019m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.\nA worker holds a Playstation 5 at a Best Buy store during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Nov. 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Jim Vondruska) \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nDiscounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve\u2019s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.\nHeadphones\nWhether you\u2019re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you\u2019re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.\nThe fourth generation of AirPods is showcased as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, Calif., Sept. 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo/File Photo) \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nIt\u2019s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can\u2019t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you\u2019re into.\nYou\u2019ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.\nLaptops\nIn the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You\u2019re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple\u2019s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft\u2019s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That\u2019s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.\nStory Continues\nGenerally, when you\u2019re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That\u2019s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they\u2019ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.\nTVs\nTVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don\u2019t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.\nWhen it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you\u2019re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.\nTelevisions are displayed for sale ahead of Black Friday at a Walmart Supercenter on Nov. 14, 2023, in Burbank, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \u00b7 Mario Tama via Getty Images\nIf there\u2019s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it\u2019s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don\u2019t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you\u2019re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG\u2019s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.\nPhones and tablets\nIf you\u2019re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you\u2019re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you\u2019ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.\nTablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they\u2019re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.\nSmart speakers and streaming devices\nAmazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.\nAmazon\u2019s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku\u2019s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google\u2019s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I\u2019ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Analysts were expecting 87 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates.\nShares of CrowdStrike had fallen 5.9% at 1:33 p.m. in New York on Wednesday.\nThe report is the company\u2019s second since a flawed CrowdStrike update crashed millions of devices operating on Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Windows systems. The outage, which unfolded on July 19, disrupted a wide range of industries, including air travel, banks and health care. The company posted sales three months ago that beat expectations, a sign that investors took to mean the global IT outage wouldn\u2019t significantly affect its finances.\nThird-quarter revenue represented a bright spot in Tuesday\u2019s report. Sales for the period came to $1.01 billion, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Profit, excluding some items, was 93 cents a share, compared with the average estimate of 81 cents.\nCrowdStrike also raised its guidance for revenue for the full fiscal year, to $3.92 billion to $3.93 billion. Analysts were expecting $3.9 billion.\nThe company surpassed $4 billion in annual recurring revenue as of Oct. 31, making CrowdStrike \u201cthe fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone,\u201d Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said in the statement.\nThe company excluded roughly $26 million from its annual recurring revenue in the quarter, CrowdStrike Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere said during the earnings call. That came after a distributor in the federal space provided notice of its intention \u201cto exercise transferability rights with respect to a transaction,\u201d and CrowdStrike concluded the transaction wouldn\u2019t recur. That transaction remains in revenue in compliance with US revenue recognition rules, Podbere said.\nCrowdStrike previously agreed to a $32 million deal with Carahsoft Technology Corp., a distributor which serves as a middleman between technology companies and government agencies, for identity protection software intended for the US Internal Revenue Service. But the IRS never purchased the software, Bloomberg reported in October.\nStory Continues\nThe deal caused concern within CrowdStrike and, according to some legal and accounting experts, raised red flags.\nJeremy Fielding, a spokesperson for CrowdStrike, declined to say whether the company\u2019s comments were related to the Carahsoft deal involving the IRS. \u201cOur comments during the Q3 FY 25 earnings call speak for themselves,\u201d he said in an email. Carahsoft didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nDelta Airlines\u2019 operations were stunted for days as a result of the outage, costing the airline at least $500 million in out-of-pocket losses, according to a lawsuit it filed against CrowdStrike in October. CrowdStrike said Delta was shifting blame \u201cfrom its failure to update its antiquated IT infrastructure,\u201d in a statement at the time.\n\u201cFollowing this summer\u2019s incident as a company we were tested,\u201d Kurtz said, in a call with investors on Tuesday. \u201cWe responded with speed, care and resolve and we focused on becoming even better.\u201d\n(Updates shares in third paragraph and with additional information in 10th and 11th paragraph.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Sees Strong Module Adoption, Valuation Concerns Persist: Analysts\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock is trading lower Wednesday after the company reported third-quarter financial results.\nOn Tuesday, CrowdStrike reported third-quarter revenue of $1.01 billion, up 29%, beating the\u00a0consensus estimate of $982.36 million.\u00a0The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, beating analyst estimates of $0.81. Annual recurring revenue increased 27% to $4.02 billion.\nAlso Read: Microsoft\u2019s Brad Smith Urges Trump Government to Tackle Growing Cyber Threats\nCrowdStrike expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.029 billion\u2014$1.035 billion, versus estimates of $1.03 billion. The company anticipates fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.84\u2014$0.86 versus estimates of $0.86.\nCrowdStrike now expects full-year revenue of $3.924 billion\u2014$3.931 billion, compared to estimates of $3.897 billion. The company also expects full-year EPS of $3.74\u2014$3.76, compared to estimates of $3.63.\nAnalysts rerated the stock after the quarterly print.\nWestPark Capital analyst Paul Rodriguez reiterated CrowdStrike with a Hold.\nNeedham analyst Mike Cikos maintained CrowdStrike with a Buy and raised the price target from\u00a0$360\u00a0to\u00a0$420.\nWestPark Capital: Based on the upbeat quarterly print and guidance boost, Rodriguez increased their full-year estimates to $3.93 billion in revenue and $3.76 in EPS, up from prior projections of $3.89 billion and $3.62.\nThe adoption rate of CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity modules continues to outpace its overall revenue growth of 28.5% in the third quarter. Customers using five or more modules are driving this momentum, suggesting that spending on additional modules could sustain growth above 28% for longer than anticipated. Integrating Next-Gen SIEM and artificial intelligence tools like Charlotte AI further supports this trend, fueling customer interest and module adoption.\nWhile the quarter\u2019s overall performance was robust, CrowdStrike\u2019s net new ARR declined compared to the second quarter, dropping to $217 million. The company attributed this to the July security incident and a slowdown in new customer acquisitions. Despite this, management expressed confidence in regaining growth in net new ARR as fiscal 2026 approaches.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s valuation continues to trade at a significant premium relative to its peers. The company\u2019s calendar year 2025 price-to-sales (P/S) multiple stands at 19.7x, compared to the peer average of 10.5x. Similarly, its enterprise value-to-sales (EV/Sales) multiple of 22.4x far exceeds the peer group\u2019s 9.3x. Analysts at WestPark reiterated a \u201cHold\u201d rating, citing these valuation disparities. Rodriguez expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.034 billion and EPS of $0.85.\nStory Continues\nNeedham:\u00a0CrowdStrike exceeded all guided metrics in its third quarter of fiscal year 2025, demonstrating solid execution despite industry challenges. Gross retention, which declined less than 0.5% quarter-over-quarter, highlights the company\u2019s resilience and supports management\u2019s approach to leveraging opportunities amid crises. A $500 million quarter-over-quarter increase in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reflects a surge in multi-year contracts. CrowdStrike consolidates customers onto its Falcon platform and strengthens retention through multi-module adoption, making replacements more difficult.\nManagement acknowledges reduced visibility heading into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, emphasizing headwinds in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and subscription growth. However, the company remains confident about ARR reacceleration in the second half of fiscal 2026.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon Flex offering has gained significant traction, with its total contract value (TCV) nearly doubling quarter-over-quarter to $1.3 billion, up from $700 million in the prior quarter. Flex customers, often strategic partners, spend millions of dollars with CrowdStrike, far exceeding the spending of the average customer.\nThe company\u2019s Next-Gen SIEM product continues to grow rapidly, with ARR increasing over 150% year-over-year, nearing $300 million. Adoption by over 2,000 customers underscores its appeal, with each paying approximately $150,000 annually.\nCikos raised the price target, applying a 21.3x EV/Sales multiple to fiscal 2026 revenue estimates. The updated valuation reflects increased confidence in CrowdStrike\u2019s ability to execute its customer commitment strategy and outperform its target operating model. The previous price target of $360 was based on an 18.3x EV/Sales multiple.\nCrowdStrike is poised for further growth as it continues to capitalize on multi-module adoption and innovative offerings like Falcon Flex and Next-Gen SIEM. Management\u2019s focus on ARR recovery and cost optimization positions the company for improved visibility and performance exiting fiscal 2025.\nCikos expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.034 billion and EPS of $0.86. He projects fiscal 2025 revenue of $3.901 billion and EPS of $3.62.\nPrice Action: CRWD stock is down 6.28% at $341.42 at last check Wednesday.\nAlso Read:\nMeta, OpenAI, Orange Join Forces To Build AI Models For African Languages\nPhoto via Shutterstock.\nLatest Ratings for CRWD\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nBarclays\nMaintains\nOverweight\nMar 2022\nCanaccord Genuity\nMaintains\nBuy\nMar 2022\nDeutsche Bank\nMaintains\nBuy\nView More Analyst Ratings for CRWD\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

The quarter itself was solid as CRWD beat across most of the key operating metrics we track, including billings, revenue, operating profit, and earnings.\nHowever, the quarter wasn't perfect as the company provided earnings guidance for the next quarter which fell below expectations, while revenue guidance was roughly in line.\nAdditionally, there was an unusual update during the earnings call: the removal of $26 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) from a transaction with a distributor in the Federal vertical, which is not expected to recur.\nFurthermore, management's comments during the earnings call suggest net new ARR growth is not expected to accelerate until the second half of fiscal 2026, potentially dampening near-term expectations.\nGiven the strong momentum leading up to the earnings report, the market may have been expecting a more convincing \"beat and raise\" quarter.\nThe shares closed the day at $347.71, down 4.6% from previous close.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nCrowdStrike\u2019s shares are quite volatile and have had 15 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 25.2% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit.\nKeeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.\nLastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending earlier when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results. These results could signal a shift in sentiment given CrowdStrike's popularity within the cyber security space, especially considering its cloud security capabilities.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike is up 40.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $347.65 per share, it is still trading 11.3% below its 52-week high of $392.15 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $6,176.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other AI news that broke the internet.\nOpenAI has been making headlines in the artificial intelligence realm ever since its existence, and it seems the company has something new to share almost every day. However, not all the\u00a0news surrounding the company is positive. In the latest news shared by\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0OpenAI has suspended access to its latest, highly anticipated video generation tool, Sora. This suspension followed a small group of artists who had leaked access to the tool to protest the treatment they\u2019ve been receiving at the company.\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News.\nArguing that the company used them as \u201cPR Puppets\u201d without pay, the artists created a webpage allowing anyone to make AI videos using Sora. OpenAI granted hundreds of artists free access to the video generation tool so that they could test out the new artificial intelligence video generator. However, 20 of these artists argued that the company had taken advantage of their unpaid labor. This is what the group of artists wrote on Hugging Face, an open-source repository for artificial intelligence projects.\n\u201cHundreds of artists provide unpaid labor through bug testing, feedback and experimental work for the program for a $150B valued company\u201d.\nThe artists further added that the opportunities offered in return for helping the company, such as being selected to have their Sora-created films screened, offer \u201cminimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives. The tool was public three hours before it was shut down. OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said that the company has temporarily shut down user access to Sora while it looks into the situation.\n\u201cHundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora\u2019s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards. Participation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool.\u201d\nIn other news, Axios reported that President-elect Donald Trump is considering naming an \"AI czar\" in the White House that will be coordinating federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence.

This reflects weaker demand for extended contracts and additional products, according to HSBC.\n\u201cGiven the sharp decline in the net new ARR in 3QFY25 and limited visibility of any near-term reacceleration in the trend, we now take a cautious approach given the potential for this weakness to translate in revenue deceleration,\u201d HSBC analyst said.\nHSBC raised its price target for CrowdStrike to $347 from $339, citing stronger earnings projections.

But here's the kicker: their Q4 guidance of $0.84$0.86 per share missed analyst estimates by a hair, spooking investors and overshadowing what should have been a victory lap.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with CRWD.\nSo, what's dragging CrowdStrike down? The aftermath of its infamous July software update, which crashed countless devices and left industriesfrom airlines to banksscrambling. Delta Airlines is still fuming, suing the company for $500 million in losses. Despite the fallout, CEO George Kurtz struck a confident tone, emphasizing CrowdStrike's resilience and its plans to accelerate Net New ARR growth in 2026. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike's Falcon platform and shiny new Next-Gen SIEM offering continue to gain traction, with analysts like TD Cowen doubling down on their $380 price target. In their view, the short-term noise isn't enough to derail the company's long-term growth story.\nWhat's the bottom line for investors? CrowdStrike's hiccup is a reality check in the fast-paced cybersecurity world, but it's far from a fatal blow. The company has set its sights on a massive $10 billion ARR milestone by 2031, and its strong Q3 numbers show it has the firepower to get there. The stock dip could be a golden opportunity for investors who can stomach some turbulence. CrowdStrike's growth machine is still hummingthis might just be the pause before the next sprint.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

We hope to see some of you at these events. Finally, our second quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period will begin on January 18.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nStory Continues\nRajiv Ramaswami\nThank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We are happy to report first-quarter results that came in ahead of our guidance. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership, our TCO.\nTaking a closer look at the first quarter, we exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $591 million. We grew our ARR 18% year over year to $1.966 billion. We also saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in new logos and solid free cash flow generation.\nOur largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to organizations that are looking to modernize their IT footprint, including adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models and modern applications while also managing through disruption from industry M&A.\nOne of our largest wins of the quarter was a full stack expansion with a global provider of IT consulting services based in the APAC region. This existing Nutanix customer expanded with us by shifting more workloads to our cloud platform, and adding additional components of our portfolio, enabling them to increase their automation and self-service capabilities while also reducing their exposure to their other incumbent infrastructure provider. This expansion was also aimed at strengthening their go-to-market practice with Nutanix in the areas of generating AI, modern applications, and competitive migrations.\nAnother notable win in Q1 was a significant expansion with a North American-based Fortune 100 provider of food services and products. This customer was looking to implement a hybrid multi-cloud environment with the intent of running more of their workloads in the public cloud and lowering their total cost of ownership while also reducing their exposure to our largest competitor. They chose the Nutanix Cloud platform, including our Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2, running on AWS, along with Nutanix Cloud Management. This enables them to reduce their projected TCO by nearly 50%, while also consolidating their existing data center footprint.\nOn the product front, we recently announced the general availability of GPT-in-a-Box 2.0, our solution for simplifying the deployment of generative AI applications. A key component of this offering is Nutanix Enterprise AI, or NAI, which helps streamline deployment scaling and running of influencing end points for large language models. NAI can be deployed within GPT-in-a-Box on-prem or at the edge or independently, on native public cloud services, such as AWS, EKS, and Azure AKF. These new capabilities help further our vision of becoming the leading platform for running all apps and managing data anywhere.\nA first-quarter new logo with the government ministry in the EMEA region demonstrated early progress with the new generative AI and modern application capabilities of our platform. This customer was looking to modernize their infrastructure and chose a full stack Nutanix solution to support development and deployment of their cloud-native and generative AI applications. They chose our GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution including our Nutanix Kubernetes Platform and Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure, as well as our Nutanix Unified storage and Nutanix Database Service offerings.\nMoving on, we also continue to make progress on the partnership front, signing an expanded strategic partnership with AWS that will simplify cloud migrations and offer access to AWS services for customers looking to migrate to NC2 on AWS. As part of this collaboration, customers will gain access to promotional credits from AWS to support customer migrations and proof-of-concept trials as well as Nutanix licensing promotions. Customers can also gain access to promotional credits for migrating VMware cloud and AWS workloads to NC2 on AWS through the AWS VMware migration accelerator program.\nFinally, we continue to receive industry recognition in Q1, being named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for distributed hybrid infrastructure, alongside some of the leading public cloud providers, improving from our challenged position in the 2023 Magic Quadrant.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our solid first-quarter results. Our ongoing innovation on our cloud platform, particularly with respect to its support for generative AI and modern applications and on the progress we continue to make on partnerships. We remain focused while driving sustainable, profitable growth.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Rajiv, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will first discuss our Q1 fiscal '25 results, followed by our guidance for Q2 fiscal '25 and an updated outlook for the full fiscal year 2025.\nResults in Q1 '25 came in above the high end of our range across our guided metrics. Revenue in Q1 was $591 million, higher than the guided range of $565 million to $575 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 16%. The outperformance in revenue was driven by good renewals execution. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.966 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%.\nWe saw strength in landing new customers onto our platform, helped by more leverage from our OEM and channel partners from the various programs we have put in place to incentivize new logos and from a general increase in engagement from customers looking at us as an alternative in the wake of industry M&A.\nNRR, or net dollar-based retention rate at the end of Q1 was 110%. Expansion with existing customers was impacted largely by our US federal business for which Q1 is a seasonally strong quarter given their September 30 fiscal year-end. Our US Fed business performance was lower year over year relative to the strong comparison from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to impacts from the elongated continuing resolution resulting in lighter spending from our Fed customers.\nBased on our current view, we expect our US federal business performance to return to more normal levels in the second quarter. In Q1, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels, which we believe is influenced by the macroeconomic environment and continued increased scrutiny on spend. In addition, as discussed during prior earnings calls, we believe the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure.\nThese factors also impact our ARR growth. Average contract duration in Q1 was to 3.1 years flat sequentially quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 87.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 20%, higher than our guided range of 14.5% to 15.5%, largely due to higher revenue and to a smaller extent, due to lower expenses including as a result of certain nonrecurring payments and credits.\nNon-GAAP net income in Q1 was $122 million, of fully diluted EPS of $0.42 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares. GAAP net income and fully diluted GAAP EPS in Q1 were $30 million and $0.10 per share, respectively. Free cash flow in Q1 was $152 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 26%.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalence and short-term investments of $1.075 billion up from $994 million at the end of Q4.\nMoving to capital allocation. We repurchased about $20 million worth of shares in Q1 and used about $79 million of cash in Q1 to retire shares related to our employees' STAC liability for their quarterly RSU vesting.\nMoving to Q2 '25. Our guidance for Q2 is as follows: revenue of $635 million to $645 million; non-GAAP operating margin of 20% to 21%; fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares.\nMoving to the full year. The updated guidance for fiscal year '25 is as follows: revenue of $2.435 billion to $2.465 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 14% at third point and no change from our initial guidance. The non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 16% to 17%, an increase from our previous guidance. Free cash flow of $560 million to $610 million, representing a free cash flow margin of approximately 24% at the midpoint and an increase of $15 million relative to our prior initial guidance at the midpoint.\nI will now provide some commentary and assumptions regarding our updated fiscal year '25 guidance. First, we are seeing continued land-and-expand opportunities and a growing pipeline for our solutions. However, as we have discussed previously, we expect continued uncertainty in the timing, outcome and deal structure from the growing mix of larger deals in the pipeline. And as I mentioned earlier, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels, which we believe is related to the uncertain spending environment and which we expect to continue.\nSecond, the guidance assumes that renewals will continue to perform well in fiscal year '25. Third, the full-year guidance assumes that average contract duration will be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '24 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings.\nFourth, the non-GAAP operating margin guidance assumes incremental prudent investments in sales and marketing and research and development, targeted towards addressing our large market opportunity. Those investments are expected to continue to ramp through the course of the fiscal year.\nFinally, a note on seasonality. Based on our current view of renewal's cohorts and visibility into land and expand, we expect revenue seasonality in fiscal Q3 relative to Q2 to be similar to what we saw in fiscal year '23.\nIn closing, we are pleased that our Q1 performance exceeded the high end of our guidance and would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, investors and stakeholders for their continued trust in us. We remain committed to continued progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth, both through durable top line growth and expanding margins.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Pinjalim Bora, JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora\nRajiv, one for you. Maybe can you talk about what are you hearing from customers around the VMS offering? Trying to understand if this new partnership with AWS. It might act as a catalyst to kind of convince people to move to NC2 or are you seeing any signs of that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nOkay. Pinjalim, Rajiv here. I think you meant VMC on AWS, correct? You said VMS --\nPinjalim Bora\nCorrect. VMC, correct.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nVMC on AWS, correct. Okay. All right. So clearly, I think that seems to be an offering that Broadcom is not focused on as much. And it's created an opportunity for us, for sure, and customers are concerned as to what might happen with their offering.\nFor example, the go cloud version of their offering, garment cloud version was apparently deprecated by Broadcom. So this is one of the impetus for the expanded partnership that we have with AWS, where we are working together with them to provide EVM migration for customers from BMC onto NC2 on AWS. We talked about one of the wins last quarter actually, leading universities that actually went and did exactly that. And anyway. So this is really one of the impetus why AWS is partnering with us.\nThey're offering immigration credit. The migration accelerator program, and we are working together to help customers who might be interested in migrating off that offering on to something else in the public\nPinjalim Bora\nYes. Understood. One for Rukmini. Rukmini, I'm trying to understand the guidance. It seems like a very solid Q1 beat.\nYou took the Q2 numbers up, but the second half seems like it's an implied guide down because you didn't take the full year number up. So I'm trying to understand, is that just prudent caution around what you're seeing on the sales cycles, Were there any deals that mkind of moved from the second half into the first half that changed the seasonality a bit? And lastly, do you think we're close to a trough on NRR?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Pinjalim. Both good questions. I'll start with your revenue guidance first. So yes, we were happy with our Q1 revenue performance, but we are only one quarter into fiscal year. And given the uncertain environment, including that related to a new administration in the US, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year top-line guide until we have a better view of how the rest of the year is going to play out.\nAnd as I noted in my prepared remarks, we continue to see these modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. And we believe that the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions, more approvals and causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in deal structure outcome and timing.\nAnd finally, from a seasonality perspective, we've historically seen a fairly even split in revenue between the first half and second half of the fiscal year. So our current expectations aren't that different from what we've seen historically.\nSo that's on the revenue top-line guidance question, Pinjalim. I think your second part of the question was around NRR. So a few things on NRR. First, I will say that given that our GRR, while we don't disclose it, we've said in the past that it has not changed significantly relative to recent levels. So given that, the largest driver of net new ARR is land and expand ACV, right?\nAnd your question specifically is on which does not, for example, benefit from the strength that we saw in our land. So I want to first start by clarifying that. And we did see some divergence there between sort of the strength in our land performance.\nNow with respect to expand, with existing customers, expand accounts for the majority of our land and expand, which was impacted largely by our US Fed business, which was lower year over year relative to the strong compare we had from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to the CR and the continuing resolutions in the US. And so all the dynamics you talked about in large sales cycle, larger deal sizes, various sales cycles or that does impact expand as well, Pinjalim. So that all did go into the NRR number.\nNow I think your question was around, is this the -- is this -- have we hit sort of the low point for NRR. We don't guide to NRR, as you know. But we do expect that and will be impacted by some of these factors that we've talked about like the sales cycles and the mix of large deals when we expect some of that to continue.\nSo that, we believe is the case, but we don't explicitly guide to NRR.\nOperator\nMeta Marshall, Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall\nGreat. Maybe following up on the federal piece. You noted in the script that you expected kind of fiscal Q2 to be better. I would expect you would need the administration change, so maybe you wouldn't expect kind of federal to improve until fiscal Q3, but just wanted to kind of listen about what went into that commentary or you could explain that more. And then maybe just a second question.\nJust any update on timing of Dell PowerFlex kind of integration? Just anything there would be helpful.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo Meta, on the federal question, I mean, we don't have visibility in terms of what the new administration is going to do or not do. So we can't really talk about what's going to happen after the new agitation comes in. So we have a near-term view on Q2, of course, which we factored in. And that's why we feel comfortable about our federal business coming back to more normal levels in Q2 based on what we know today. And of course, we'll have to see what the new administration does after they come on board.\nNow on the Dell question, specifically. So as you know, Meta, there's two parts to the Dell relationship. One is the existing hyper-converged solution that we have, which will be an appliance sale by combining our software on their service. That's been in the market now this quarter, and it's still early days for that.\nYour question on PowerFlex. We expect to have that in the market in the first half of calendar '25, and we expect to see some revenue contribution from it in FY26.\nOperator\nJim Fish, Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish\nI did want to build off of Meta's question and Pinjalim there a little bit. Can you just remind us how big this federal vertical can be for you guys here in fiscal Q1 versus kind of what you saw here? And what the actual impact net retention rate was? Like are we talking about a point or two difference that we would have seen versus the 110% or how to kind of quantify that?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nI'll take that, Jim. So First, on quantification of Fed, we don't disclose that, Jim. But as you can imagine and we've said this before, that for our Q1 is typically the seasonally strongest quarter given it's also the federal year-end, which covers September 30. So we don't disclose that number, Jim, but that is Q1 is our strongest Fed quarter. And similarly, right, we're not going to break out NRR impact by Fed or by any other sort of segmentation at this point.\nBut we did see the fact that overall Fed and expand specifically was lower than last year. It was a challenge for us in Q1 relative to what we saw last Q1, which was a strong one to compare.\nJames Fish\nGot it. And Rajiv, maybe for you. I think we're all kind of anxious to hear about when we could see more stand-alone into other storage arrays. Obviously, you just talked about the calendar first half of '25 seeing Dell PowerFlex. But how should we start thinking about Nutanix's relationships of getting stand-alone AHV integration into some of the other providers out there?\nAnd why we wouldn't start to see that AHV attach go from 7% today to faster to 100?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I think those are two different questions there, Jim. I think on the first question, clearly, the only one that we've announced so far has been Dell PowerFlex relationship. As you can imagine, we do have plans to expand that selectively to other storage arrays over time. I'm not going to preannounce anything right now, but you can assume that we are working on that in a very careful way. At the same time, we also want to make sure that whatever we do is actually focusing on expanding the market opportunity for us and doesn't cannibalize the existing HCI opportunity.\nSo we are focused specifically on working with storage array vendors that are workloads that would not necessarily be easier to capture with HCI because the workload we can capture with our own HCI platform, we would like to do that at the full stack.\nAnd over time, even for those that we do go in our goal is to sell the full stack over time. So stay tuned. I mean, we, of course, will continue to explore other options in the market when it comes to other storage arrays. And you can -- we don't have any more to say at this point. But the idea is to start with Dell and then over time expand to others.\nWith respect to your question on AHV penetration. Again, I think our philosophy has always been we support multiple hypervisors. And there's been a natural cadence to buy which the AHV adoption has continued to grow, and we are still at where it is. I don't necessarily need it to be 100%, frankly, but our goal is to increase the AHV footprint because we also want to be able to insert into VMware accounts, where our platform is running on top of ESX, the VMware hypervisor, and we'll continue to support that going forward as well.\nBut we would, of course, like to see more and more customers start to migrate over to our ASV footprint. And having, of course, this third-party storage support will only help amplify that.\nOperator\nJason Ader, William Blair.\nJason Ader\nSo when I look at the second half and you gave basically guidance revenue per quarter for the second half. But then looking at the operating margin for the year, you raised that only slightly after having pretty significant outperformance in Q1 and also guiding to a pretty robust operating margin in Q2. So that implies the second half is going to be kind of weigh down on the operating margin.\nAnd I know you said you're going to be ramping expenses, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing kind of idiosyncratic to the second half that we're not thinking about. And then can you talk about where that ramp up in spending is going to come. You said sales and marketing and R&D, but could you be more specific within those buckets.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nJason, first, on operating margin. So you're correct. So first, I'll start with revenue. What we said was -- I think in response to an earlier question, that our implied revenue split, first half to second half is roughly even based on the -- and that's similar to our historical patterns. While we expect operating expenses on the other hand, to grow over the course of the year, much like it did last fiscal year.\nSo to your point, you're correct that we will expect to see lower operating margins in the second half of the year and fiscal year '25. However, overall, we still expect to see year-over-year improvement in operating margin for the full fiscal year relative to fiscal year '24. And then to the second part of your question on where are we spending those dollars.\nSo first, in R&D, we have talked about investing, for example, in these AHV standalone to support the stand-alone storage arrays. So that's one area of R&D investment. Some other examples include we have ramped up our offerings around cloud native or containerized applications. That's another area generative AI plus our core enterprise platform, right, to the platform and making sure that it continues to evolve. So even within our core platforms, there are innovations that we continue to drive.\nSo that's on the R&D side, some examples of where we're investing.\nOn the sales and marketing side, we have talked about some investments we've made -- some we made last year and some will continue into this year, for example, around product specialist sellers, folks who are focused on selling our entire portfolio and helping our main field sellers go do that. We have increased some investments around the channel as another example, some inside sales folks who can be focused on driving both expansion and land around the more mid-market tiers. So those are some examples of areas that we're investing in both sales and marketing and in R&D.\nOperator\nWamsi Mohan, Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nIt's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Rukmini, the renewals business has been strong. How should we think about the growth in available to renew pool in fiscal '25 versus fiscal '24? And is there any danger that renewals kind of fall off a cliff in fiscal '26? Or is there a large enough cohort of customers who are going to renew in fiscal '26 that strong growth in renewals continues and it grows as a mix of the business.\nSo just your thoughts on available to renew pool and how you see that business continuing to grow?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. So you're correct that we did talk about renewals doing well for Q1. In terms of ATR for full year fiscal year '25, I think we referred to this in our last earnings call when we gave you all the initial guide for fiscal year '25. Available to the new pool or ATR is expected to grow nicely in '25 year over year versus '24, and we'll continue to grow quite nicely over the next few years, Ruplu. So I'm not going to give you a quantification for fiscal year '26 at this point.\nWe're still only one quarter into '25. But yes, we expect that growth in available to renew for our renewal cohorts to continue for the next couple of years.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nOkay. And maybe for my follow-up, I'll ask you another question. Free cash flow in fiscal 1Q was very strong. It was $152 million, which I don't think, over the last three, four years, you've had such a strong 1Q. Were there any one-time items?\nI know last quarter, you had said that you might get from a partner, I think you had said $30 million benefit for the full year in terms of free cash flow. So any guidance on how we should think about the progression of free cash flow first half versus second half in this year?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. We were happy with our free cash flow performance in Q1, as you alluded to. So nothing significant, I would call out as onetime. So you're right, those partner payments, we did call out for fiscal year '25 and those will continue to come in. They might be a little inconsistent in terms of quarter to quarter, but we're not breaking that out quarterly, Ruplu.\nThere wasn't any one thing I would call out. For example, in Q4, in our July quarter, we did call out there was one significant deal that we collected in that quarter. For example, there was nothing like that, that I would call out for Q1. And more generally, I think when you think about just, I think rest of the year, part of your question is $152 million was a strong Q1, and our full-year guide is $560 million to $610 million. And so I'll just remind you that, one, expenses are going up, expected to go up through the rest of the year.\nSo keep that in mind, right, those expenses will ramp over the course of the year, much like they did last fiscal year. So that in. And we do collect multiple years of cash from our customers typically upfront. And so that does mean that depending on duration or depending on some larger deals, there can be some variation quarter to quarter in that number, which is why we continue to guide for free cash flow really on an annual basis only.\nOperator\nMike Cikos, Needham.\nMichael Cikos\nI'm going to ask a boring one on guidance and build on some of the line of questioning that Mr. Rader was going after on the operating margin and the operating profit. But I just wanted to get a better understanding congratulations on the 20% operating margin we're seeing here in Q1.\nIs the view for full year in any way informed like are we potentially behind on hiring versus where we expected to be exiting Q1? Or are you potentially increasing your view of additional investments in sales and marketing and R&D? Because I know that's something that we had flagged on the previous quarter. Just wanted to wrestle those two items.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Mike. Always welcome the boring question on the guide. So thank you for that. Not at all boring, actually. It's very, very practical.\nSo when we think of spend and our planning cycles, Mike. So we're coming out of our planning cycle. And so as we deploy this, again, similar to last fiscal year, some of this will be ramping over the course of the year. So that is in the plan. And so you'll continue to see that this year relative to last year, right?\nSo there's nothing unusual or different necessarily that I would call out other than, of course, as we hire people in Q1 or Q2, they might be there for partially for that quarter. But then for the next quarter, they're there for the full quarter, right? So there is that almost normalization that happened over the course of the year. And so that's what's baked into the op margin guide for the full year relative to what you saw in Q1.\nMichael Cikos\nGot it. And then just one other, if I could. I know that we're -- and I appreciate the commentary here as well as far as the Q2 versus 3Q seasonality on revenue. I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about this properly, even if I go back beyond last year, two years ago, we tend to see coal at a 7% to 8%, 7% feels about right as far as a sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3. And I appreciate your qualitative comments, but if you could further elaborate on that.\nWhat is driving that seasonal component? Is it really tied to year-end in Q2 and then maybe the sales incentive comp for your sales force in Q4? Is that why we should be thinking about that Q2 to Q3 sequential movements that we're talking to?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nYou're exactly right, Mike. So historically, if you look at our performance, Q2 and Q4 tend to be seasonally stronger quarters from a top line perspective, exactly for the recency outline because Q2 has the December year-end. And Q4 had our end of fiscal year, and therefore, some sales incentives tied to a strong finish there. What has happened also is as we now have the renewal cohorts layering in, they tend to follow similarly the land expand performance in the past because they're just reflective of deals that were signed and when those renewals view.\nSo now we have the impact of historical land and expand, but the renewal cohorts are also following that pattern. So we just wanted to remind folks of that going into Q3 and give you a sense of qualitatively, what to expect relative to the Q2 guidance.\nOperator\nBen Bollin, Cleveland Research Company.\nBen Bollin\nRajiv, I wanted to get your perspective a bigger picture on enterprise refresh behavior, in particular, around how you see customers evolving around three-tier versus HCI? Any thoughts on the pace and rate of enterprise on-prem AI deployments?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I'll take those two questions separately. I don't think Ben that much has changed with respect to three-tier versus HCI. We still continue to validate the proposition of 40% -- 40% to 50% lower TCO if you replace your three-tier with SCI and it also provides you the platform to really expand into becoming a hybrid cloud, which is what companies want. And so over time, I do expect to continue to see HCI gain into the legacy three-tier offering. So that part hasn't really changed.\nThe dynamics really haven't changed. Of course, it's usually tied to a hardware refresh cycle because that's when you refresh your storage arrays. And instead of refreshing storage here is what we tell customers when they just buy simple servers and put HCI on it. So no change really on that front.\nOn enterprise AI, what we see again is that the bulk of the spend so far have been not really in the enterprise, but in these large hyperscalers as they build out these massive clusters to train these large language models with huge investments from a small handful of very large providers. So we see that for sure.\nNow within the enterprise, most enterprises are, I would say, in the early stages of deploying Generative AI, largely for RAG relative long into generation and fine-tuning and inferencing. They're not going to train these models. They're going to use models that are pre-existing and then use them to drive inferencing but more cost-effective, smaller clusters. We think that, that segment of the market is in early stages. We have seen the first set of applications come about.\nEven this quarter, as you know, we talked about this government customer in EMEA that's starting to use our GPT 2.0 offering. I would say most enterprises are in the early stages of adoption, including ourselves, where we're targeting to see things like a 25% productivity gain for our developers, our improvements in how we manage legal contracts. So companies looking at fraud detection. These are the kind of use cases that we're starting to see emerge. But I would say it's in the early days.\nMost enterprises are only now getting into the act of trying to build these applications. And I do think that this space is going to continue to grow over the next few years, but it's still largely incubation at this point in the enterprise.\nBen Bollin\nThat's great. And Rukmini, if I could. In the past, you had provided some perspective on the growth of $1 million-plus deals in your pipeline relative to the remainder of the business. Curious if you have any updates on that metric exiting the quarter?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ben. I will say we are continuing to see nice growth in our pipeline, including for the larger deals that we've talked about before, Ben, we're not updating those metrics specifically on a quarterly basis. But yes, we are seeing continued interest and engagement and growth in pipeline from those $1 million-plus sort of cohorts and more generally.\nOperator\nSimon Leopold, Raymond James.\nVictor Chiu\nThis is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to drill into your commentary around the increased customer engagement from VMware Basin. Maybe help us understand if this was an incremental acceleration relative to what you were previously observing? If so, maybe help us understand what's driving that and if you expect that to continue?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo, Victor, the market continues to be dynamic. But from our perspective, it's still largely unchanged in terms of our opportunity, a multiyear opportunity to gain share. So we haven't seen a significant change in that this quarter compared to the last several quarters really. And we haven't seen any real meaningful changes in our win-loss rate size around these opportunities. I'll say what we've already said before, right, a lot of these deals are tied to VMware customers, their ELA renewal cycles.\nThey try to when the installed base is coming up for a hardware refresh, although we are also expanding our ability to capture -- to have our solutions work on existing hardware like, for example, the three-tier work that we're doing with Dell or like continuing to be able to deploy our software on already existing BMS HCI customers. And of course, it's a dynamic market in the sense that sometimes we see aggressive behavior from Broadcom as well to keep those customers especially the very large ones. So really, I would say, net-net, nothing much has changed.\nVictor Chiu\nOkay. And if the organization decides that they wanted to move away from VMware kind of, on average, how long is that transition typically? And kind of what are the steps involved that required for a customer to do something like that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nCorrect. It depends on the scale and complexity of their deployment. So if they are -- for example, I'll give you the two bookends. So on the small -- on the easy side, if they are just largely the say, vSphere customer and they're willing to replace their hardware. It's a very easy migration.\nWe can migrate that within a month or two off a relatively small scale. A lot of that is automated as well. Same goes for public cloud to public cloud. And there was a question earlier about VMS Cloud on AWS. Those offerings are actually very easy to migrate.\nAgain, this in a month, we can have those customers off and on to a tan offer. But at the other end of the spectrum are these large customers that use multiple VMware products with massive estates. And there, it can be many years. It can be three years to do a migration. Just because they can't migrate all of it at once, there is a requirement for a professional services engagement to convert over some of their more complex custom scripts, they have return on customer investments they've made on top of the VMS portfolio.\nSo those migrations tend to be complex, require professional services and take a few years. So there's an entire spectrum across those.\nVictor Chiu\nDo you have maybe kind of a general ballpark kind of estimation of what percentage is the easy kind of low-hanging fruit? And what --?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I would say if you look at -- with the exception of, I think, if you go to a large Tier 1 big global accounts, those are the ones that are difficult, right? The vast majority of the smaller customers are going to be more on the easy side.\nOperator\nMatt Hedberg, RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg\nI just wanted to ask, obviously, it sounds like the federal business had some headwinds. Maybe just a simple question, but Rajiv, did the enterprise business, do you think it deteriorated from a demand perspective versus last quarter? Just because it seems like good revolve, but just trying to get a kind of finer point on sort of like your thought on enterprise spending today versus maybe many days ago?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. Matt, clearly, we saw the softness in Fed for sure. We saw it -- that was a very clear cut. The broader enterprise, I we've actually, again, been doing quite well at landing new logos and people migrating. But of course, some of that is perhaps due to just what's happening with the Broadcom situation.\nSo we haven't seen a decline in enterprise spend or less willingness to spend. What we have seen, and we've been talking about this in multiple quarters, Matt, is lot more inspection going on the Fed and a lot more approvals being required higher in the food chain, looking at TCO more carefully, which, of course, plays to our benefit in some articles what we talk about in this environment is how we can reduce TCO.\nSo that dynamic has been going on now for several quarters. We haven't seen much of a change. So net-net, I have to say it for the broader enterprise demand, we haven't seen a change this quarter compared to the prior quarters.\nMatthew Hedberg\nGot it. That's very clear. And then maybe another sort of, I guess, macro question for Rukmini. Obviously, it's not your year-end, but do you typically see a December budget flush from an enterprise percent? I can't imagine you're baking that into guidance.\nJust kind of curious on historically, do you see customers kind of spend it or lose it mentality when it comes to December, your calendar year end?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nI mean certainly, sometimes, right? I mean they may have a budget that's available for this year. We've seen that in the past. We probably will see some of that this year as well, right? I mean I think they do have -- I mean, if your company is on that calendar cycle, yes, you probably will have some budget to spend -- but again, I would not say we factor whatever we can see into our guide for Q2.\nSo nothing really different this year compared to prior years. And so typically, we see a seasonal increase in Q2 compared to Q1. And that's driven in part by the fact that what you alluded to, Matt, but people spending at the end of the year.\nOperator\nGeorge Wang, Barclays.\nI just had two quick ones. Firstly, can you kind of double-click in terms of the channel incentives in place kind of what has changed versus three months ago in terms of providing the promo and the incentives to the channel, especially at the backdrop of for maybe overlapping Nutanix or VMware contract?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean this is a few months ago that we made the change, no recent changes, by the way, on the channel side. We made that going a while ago. But what we did, we did a couple of things there, Joe. First thing we did was we took a subset of our customer base, our target prospects and handed them off entirely to the channel to go drive.\nAnd so we don't have our reps on those accounts. We leave it to the channel, and we provided more incentives to those channel partners to bring us business. So we have incentives in place for our channel partners to bring new logos to us in terms of rewards that they will get more rewards when they bring new logos to us. We are also committed to the channel in the sense that all our deals go through the channel partners. So we're not trying to work around them or shut them out of any of the deals.\nAnd so we've seen, certainly, as a result of all of that, a significant increase in channel partner engagement with us over the last year or two. Some of it is, of course, just what they're seeing with Broadcom, more child partners coming to us, some of it is our own incentives that we are offering for them.\nAnd we also have incentives for the end customer as well, right? So for example, to help them tide over migrations, we can offer them free licenses for a period of time to help them while they're still spending money on VMware to get going on our products until they're ready to go migrate fully over.\nOkay. Just a follow-up, if I can. Just in terms of repatriation, just as kind of a theme, which benefits on Nutanix. Just curious if anything has changed on the repenetration, any additional data points versus last quarter?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. In terms of cloud repatriation, I would say we haven't seen like a massive repatriation of workloads coming back from the public cloud. We see some of that here and there, right? That's where I would characterize it not has changed compared to past quarter. But I think what we see is, again, I can see there is people are much more careful about what they go put in the cloud.\nSo keep in mind that the vast majority of enterprise workloads are still on-prem, not in the public cloud. And now CIOs are being more circumspect about what to use the public cloud for. For example, there's a realization that if we have steady-state workloads, those workloads can be run more efficiently on-prem than in the public cloud. And so this CIO of therefore saying, well, I'm going to keep that workload on-prem. I'm not going to move that to the public cloud.\nSo that's what we are seeing.\nOperator\nNehal Chokshi, Northland Capital Markets.\nNehal Chokshi\nCongrats on the really strong new logo up to 2% year-over-year. That's really impressive. I'm trying to put though, why is ARR decelerating given the strong land that you're seeing? And then if I look at the incremental ARR, i.e., the change quarter-over-quarter or October quarter, relative to the year ago quarter, that was down a lot as well. So thoughts on why are there such a weak incremental ARR characteristics, especially given the backdrop that you're having such strong WAN metrics?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nNehal, thank you. So a few things to -- I'll start with on your point about net new ARR. So One of the biggest drivers of net new ARR, which is simply, as you pointed out, the difference between ARR in this quarter versus the prior quarter is land and expand ACV. And given that our GRR has not changed significantly relative to recent historical levels. And so when you think about land and expand, we did see some divergence, as you point out in the performance of the land versus the expand portion of our business.\nSo we saw strength in the new customers. And we've talked about why that is. And so really happy with that performance.\nExpansion with existing customers, which actually accounts for the majority of the land and expand was impacted largely by our US federal business, Nihal, and we've talked about why we believe that will be the case. And so -- and overall, by the way, right, we've talked about these larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline which are taking longer to close and have data variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. So all of those factors also do impact our ARR growth. So that's how to think about just ARR and net new ARR.\nOperator\nMichael, Wells Fargo.\nI'll ask one on behalf of Aaron. I just want to ask about GPT 2.0 or GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution. I'm just curious, as you think about, I guess, the positioning of that in the marketplace relative to kind of a full stack or a three-tier architecture with NVIDIA's AI enterprise software suite. How do these differ in terms of where they sit in the market that I guess do you see opportunity to maybe move up market as these solutions mature going forward?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean some of that is also a difference between training and inferencing. We are largely with GPT-in-a-Box focused on influencing, focusing on smaller clusters, not massive compute funds to our trade models. Smaller clusters that enterprises can use to deploy more cost-effective AI inferencing applications. I'll give you one example.\nWe, for example, one of our first use cases in Nutanix internally, was a customer service use case where incoming service request from a customer support ticket, the support engineer actually has a natural language into search interface through which they enter the query and then we look through all-on-one basis to try and accelerate our -- the ability to answer that issue. And that AI application is running on just a small cluster, okay, leaving an open source large language model.\nAnd that's the kind of upstarting on GPT-in-a-Box internally. And that's the kind of use case that we're enabling for the enterprise, where you have your secure data, you want to do your inferencing on it, using existing models that are already pretrained, but fine-tuned with your use cases. So that's a cost-optimized solution.\nAnd by the way, we are partnered with NVIDIA on that because we work with the immediate inferencing solution as well as, of course, using their GPUs to do all the hard work needed here. So again, I just think we want to distinguish between influencing on small clusters, which is mostly what we do versus training of very large clusters.\nThat's helpful. And if I can sneak one more in. Just as we think about an improving sort of traditional server end demand environment and as we think about refresh cycles. Obviously, that presents an insertion opportunity for you guys within three-tier architecture. So I'm curious with the new partnerships with Dell and Cisco.\nHave you seen your win rates at all changing? Or do you anticipate those improving given your kind of broader ability to enter those deals?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. First of all, I think I think Cisco and Dell selling our products is, of course, positive for us. And Cisco has been a good contributor to our new logos this quarter as well as last quarter. That is still, I think, very early days for us. And that's independent of the server refresh cycle or not, right?\nSecond, I would say, with respect to refresh cycles, yes, server refreshes will help, but also storage of freshers are important, right? Because that's when we get the opportunity to displace those three-tier architectures with HCI footprint. So both matter. I think having Dell and Cisco as friends in the market, of course, significantly helps. And at the same time, the refresh cycles -- more so, I would say storage or fresh and server refresh will help us insert HCI into existing deployments.\nOperator\nThank you, and thanks for participating. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.\n8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nA close up of a circuit board, its microchips creating a powerful computing system.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +9.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share, indicating a change of +15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)\nWhat a fantastic six months it\u2019s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is NOW a Good Business?\nFounded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.\n1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nServiceNow\u2019s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters,\u00a0its year-on-year growth averaged\u00a024.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nSell-side analysts expect ServiceNow\u2019s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nServiceNow\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate\nServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\nStory Continues\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on ServiceNow, and with the recent rally, the stock trades at 17.6x forward price-to-sales (or $1,055 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than ServiceNow\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we\u2019re here to help you pick them.\nGet started by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like United Rentals (+550% five-year return).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

These platforms are expanding the company\u2019s abilities in the IT market.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) bulls believe the company\u2019s organic revenue growth after fiscal 2025 could clock in between 20% to 22%. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) can also expand its margins by 250bps annually, driven by 100bps from gross profits, 100bps from R&D reductions, and 50bps from SG&A leverage.\nServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0will also benefit from organic growth catalysts. Grand View Research predicts that the global information technology service management (ITSM) market will grow at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc.

One such country in the picture that\u2019s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Updates You Can\u2019t Miss This Weekend and Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight\nThe remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do \"everything they can to lock their digital doors\" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\"While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it\".\nMcFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.\nIn other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.\nThe search, which started on November 1st\u00a0took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it \u201ccannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs\u2019 copied articles were used to build [OpenAI\u2019s] models\u201d.\nStory Continues\n\u201cNews plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week\u2019s worth of its experts\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today\u201d.\nOpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NYSE:NOW) and a $1,150.00 price target. Key factors noted during a recent investor meeting have led to this buy rating. A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities. Another factor adding to the positive outlook is the disciplined approach to Pro Plus (the company's new generative AI SKU) pricing. The pressure on the Subscription Gross Margin in the coming year has already been factored into the analysis.\nOverall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks to watch.

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nWhat's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?\nServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nCan we expect growth from ServiceNow?\nNYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nIf you'd like to know more about ServiceNow as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.\nThe company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.\nHard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage\nThe rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.\nApproximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.\nSome of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.\nOur bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft\u2019s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.\nCarahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn\u2019t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company\u2019s future relations with the government.\nIn a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.\nThis also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn\u2019t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock\u2019s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow ranks 24th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 97 hedge fund portfolios held NOW at the end of the second quarter which was 90 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:\n14% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\nTo start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.\nNYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\nStory Continues\nIs ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\nConclusion\nOn the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:\n\u201cWhen it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.\u201d\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks\nCramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.\nAnother sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.\nWhile some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.\nSimilarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they\u2019re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.\nAs for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they\u2019ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we\u2019re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nCramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:\n\u201cLet's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive\u2026 Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market\u2026 Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting\u2026 Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again\u2026 Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.\u201d\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company\u2019s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.\nOverall NOW ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
