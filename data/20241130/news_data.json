(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nThe chip wars between the United States and China are in full swing. After reports that the US was considering additional curbs on the export of advanced AI chips to Chinese companies, Beijing responded by saying it would take necessary actions to protect Chinese firms if the US escalated chip control measures. According to a report by news agency Reuters, when quizzed about reports that the US was planning to add 200 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist, a Chinese government spokesperson said China strongly opposes the US broadening the concept of national security, and the abuse of control measures targeting Chinese companies.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nHe Yadong, a commerce ministry spokesman, said that these actions severely disrupt the international economic and trade order, destabilise global industrial security, and harm the cooperative efforts between China and the US, as well as the global semiconductor industry, per Reuters. If the US insists on escalating control measures, China will take necessary actions to resolutely protect the legitimate rights of Chinese enterprises, he added.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other top stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months.\nOn November 25, the stock market saw a significant surge, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping 440 points to a new record close of 44,736.57. The S&P 500 also reached a new high, gaining 0.3% to 5,987.37, while the Russell 2000 index, which focuses on small-cap stocks, hit an all-time high, increasing 1.47% to 2,442.03. The Nasdaq also rose, closing 0.27% higher at 19,054.84. CNBC reported that the market\u2019s strong performance was attributed to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Scott Bessent, the founder of Key Square Group, as Treasury secretary. Investors are optimistic that Bessent, a hedge fund manager, will be supportive of the equity market and help mitigate some of Trump\u2019s protectionist policies, such as his stance on tariffs.\nUS Stocks Poised for Continued Growth\nIn an interview with CNBC on November 25, Brian Belski, Chief Investment Officer at BMO Capital Markets, expressed his bullish stance on the US stock market, stating that it remains the best asset in the world. He emphasized that despite the negativity and doubts surrounding the market, his team has consistently maintained a bullish stance since 2009.\nBelski pointed out that many investors are too focused on valuation, which he believes is the world\u2019s worst metric for predicting forward performance. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of earnings growth consistency, where the US is expected to outperform other regions.\nHe also highlighted the potential for catch-up growth in the financial sector, particularly in the areas of scale, asset managers, and discretionary spending. His team\u2019s research suggests that earnings in the US financial sector are massively understated, and he expects a big catch-up trade on the earnings front.\nRegarding valuation, Belski dismissed the idea of assigning a specific valuation metric, such as a P/E ratio, as simplistic. Instead, his team uses a macro P/E longer-term trend and a dividend discount model to evaluate the market. He believes the S&P 500 can reach 6,700, driven by US growth and earnings consistency.\nBrian Belski has been bullish on small-cap stocks for well over a year and believes small-cap stocks are a good value play. He also implies that small-cap stocks are undervalued, citing various valuation metrics such as price-to-sales, and price-to-book, as well as operating metrics such as return on assets and return on equity. He suggests that these metrics indicate that small-cap stocks are a good value investment opportunity.\nStory Continues\nThe US stock market continues to show resilience and strength, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 reaching new highs. The nomination of Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary has injected a sense of optimism into the market. With the market\u2019s strong performance and positive outlook, investors are well-positioned to take advantage of the current trend. With that in context, let\u2019s take a look at the top 8 stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the top 8 stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s database to research stocks in 8 different sectors. We picked stocks from different sectors that were the most popular among elite money managers. The final list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nWhy Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is the Top Stock to Buy in 8 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months?\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) is a leading social media and technology company, known for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The company\u2019s revenue is primarily driven by digital advertising. However, the company is investing heavily in the metaverse and is focusing on virtual and augmented reality.\nOn October 30, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced its financial results for the third quarter ending September 30. The company reported $40.59 billion in revenue, reflecting a 19% year-over-year increase. The company\u2019s operating margin rose to 43%, compared to 40% in the same quarter last year. The focus on user engagement continues to yield significant results, with Family Daily Active People (DAP) across its Family of Apps (FoA) reaching 3.29 billion, marking a 5% year-over-year growth. This success is attributed to AI-driven personalization, which enhances the user experience and fosters greater interaction. Additionally, the average price per ad increased by 11% year-over-year.\nThe company\u2019s Reality Labs division, dedicated to virtual and augmented reality, reported $270 million in revenue, accounting for a small portion of overall earnings. Although this segment continues to operate at a loss, CEO Mark Zuckerberg underscores its long-term potential to transform how people socialize, work, and transact within virtual environments. Meta Platforms, Inc.

          "whole_article": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Meta Platforms (META). Shares have added about 0.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Meta Platforms due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nMETA Q3 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates\nMeta Platforms reported third-quarter 2024 earnings of $6.03 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.18%.

As a percentage of revenues, total costs and expenses were 57.3%, significantly down from 59.7% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nIn the reported quarter, Family of Apps expenses were $18.5 billion, accounting for 80% of Meta Platforms\u2019 overall expenses.

          "whole_article": "Microsoft stock (MSFT) lagged its Big Tech peers on Friday after news broke late Wednesday that the Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust probe into the tech giant.\nAfter falling as much as 0.8% on Friday, Microsoft shares finished the session up 0.1%. The Nasdaq rose 0.8% on the day while the S&P 500 gained 0.6% to close at a record high.\nBut at least one Wall Street analyst sees the news coming as no surprise and expects changes at the FTC under the Trump administration to make antitrust worries in the tech space fade away.\n\"In our view as the dark days for tech with Lina [Khan] at the FTC appear numbered now with a Trump White House, it is not a complete shocker that Wednesday after the bell the FTC announced a broad sweeping investigation into Microsoft as a final shot across the bow at Big Tech from Kahn before she departs,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nIves added this probe \"is much more bark than bite\" and will become a secondary concern for the company once President-elect Donald Trump names a new FTC leader.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAccording to Bloomberg, which broke the story, the FTC's request to Microsoft is \"hundreds of pages long\" and focuses, among other things, on how the company bundles its cloud services with other software, like its productivity suite (Word, Outlook, Excel) and security offerings.\nCurrent FTC Chair Lina Khan has aggressively pursued antitrust actions against tech giants, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and now Microsoft.\nThe stocks of Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all trailing the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 26% year-to-date gain.\nAlphabet is currently facing the most serious threat, with a federal judge finding earlier this year that the company's Google search engine was run as an illegal monopoly. Earlier this month, the DOJ asked the company to sell its Chrome browser and divest its Android mobile operating system.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) chair Lina Khan testifies before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on May 15, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) \u00b7 Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\nFollowing Trump's election win, investor optimism grew that these various antitrust threats would disappear under his administration. Some legal experts, however, are less confident, as Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reported.\nIves, for his part, sees the recent era in which regulators sought to limit Big Tech deals and scrutinize the world's largest companies as one that is coming to an end.\n\"We believe there will be major shifts in policy against Big Tech over the coming years with Trump in the White House and Khan out at the FTC ... we believe [it is] just a matter of time and will remove a huge thorn in the side of the tech world,\" Ives wrote.\nStory Continues\n\"As someone that has covered tech throughout the Microsoft vs. US Government trial/soap opera for many years in the 1990's into an ultimate win for Redmond, we believe negotiations and remedies will be much smaller than the fears for Google, Apple, MSFT, Meta and Big Tech.\"\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

With the internet's demand skyrocketing and AI driving even more traffic, Meta's strategy to own the pipesstart to finishis nothing short of visionary.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nAnd here's where things get really interesting: India. With the largest number of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp users in the world, India is more than just a key marketit's becoming the epicenter of Meta's next big move. The company could use the subsea cable to power up its AI ambitions, leveraging India's cheap computing costs to train advanced AI models. Talk about a two-for-one deal: global connectivity and a potential AI superhub. It's a smart play for a company that makes more money outside the U.S. than in it. Sources say India's exploding data center market, coupled with demand for AI-driven services, makes it the perfect landing point.\nThis isn't just a tech story; it's a power shift. For decades, subsea cables were the domain of telecom giants working in groups. Now, big tech is rewriting the rules. Meta's move mirrors Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) strategyown the infrastructure, control the flow. And the stakes couldn't be higher. With cables increasingly targeted in global conflicts and regulators eyeing tighter control, Meta's exclusive ownership ensures security, efficiency, and independence. Sure, it'll take years to build, but when it's done, Meta won't just connect the worldit'll control how the world connects. Investors, take note: this is infrastructure dominance at its finest.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this social media company have returned +0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $6.74 per share, indicating a change of +26.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.4% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.62 points to a change of +52.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5.4%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.16 indicates a change of +11.2% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $47 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +17.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $163.11 billion and $187.07 billion estimates indicate +20.9% and +14.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $40.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.9%. EPS of $6.03 for the same period compares with $4.39 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +16.18%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Nasdaq rose 0.8% on the day while the S&P 500 gained 0.6% to close at a record high.\nBut at least one Wall Street analyst sees the news coming as no surprise and expects changes at the FTC under the Trump administration to make antitrust worries in the tech space fade away.\n\"In our view as the dark days for tech with Lina [Khan] at the FTC appear numbered now with a Trump White House, it is not a complete shocker that Wednesday after the bell the FTC announced a broad sweeping investigation into Microsoft as a final shot across the bow at Big Tech from Kahn before she departs,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nIves added this probe \"is much more bark than bite\" and will become a secondary concern for the company once President-elect Donald Trump names a new FTC leader.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAccording to Bloomberg, which broke the story, the FTC's request to Microsoft is \"hundreds of pages long\" and focuses, among other things, on how the company bundles its cloud services with other software, like its productivity suite (Word, Outlook, Excel) and security offerings.\nCurrent FTC Chair Lina Khan has aggressively pursued antitrust actions against tech giants, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and now Microsoft.\nThe stocks of Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all trailing the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 26% year-to-date gain.\nAlphabet is currently facing the most serious threat, with a federal judge finding earlier this year that the company's Google search engine was run as an illegal monopoly.

About 65% of Black Friday customers anticipate making in-store purchases on that day. Cyber Monday is the second most popular day, likely to attract 39% (72.3 million) of those planning to shop over the weekend (read: 5 ETFs to Binge on This Thanksgiving Week).\n\nAdobe expects Cyber Week (the five days including Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday) to drive $40.6 billion in online spending, up 7% year over year, and represent 16.9% of the overall holiday season. Sales on Black Friday alone are expected to grow 9.9% to $10.8 billion, according to Adobe Analytics.\nRetailers on a Roll\nThe Black Friday sales bonanza is in full swing as a number of retailers had already perked up their deals several weeks before. They are offering a range of exciting deals across various product categories. We have highlighted some of the best deals.\n\nAmazon AMZN kicked off the Black Friday event on Nov. 21.

Some top deals include 42% off a Sony PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle, 40% off a 100-inch Hisense TV and 42% off a Dyson V11 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (read: Walmart Beats on Q3 Earnings, Hikes Views: ETFs to Gain).\n\nTarget TGT kicked off its Black Friday deals eight days earlier. It is offering Black Friday discounts (online and in stores) of up to 50% off on thousands of items such as tech, apparel, video games, board games, small appliances, and more. Some examples of these deals include $75 off PlayStation 5 Consoles, 40% off sweatshirts, sweatpants, fleece, and denim and 35% off TVs and soundbars, wearable tech and massage guns.\n\nTarget also announced that it will offer special three-day-only deals starting on Thanksgiving and running through Nov. 30, with twice as many deals as last year. Then, on Dec. 1 and Dec. 2, it will drop exclusive Cyber Monday deals online and on the Target app.\n\nBest Buy BBY launched Black Friday Sale on Nov. 21, offering attractive deals on everything from electronic gadgets to electric vehicles.

          "whole_article": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 0.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.1%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.40 indicates a change of +13% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $124.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $412.8 billion and $451.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.6% and +9.3%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nApple reported revenues of $94.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.1%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.46 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $94.56 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.39%. The EPS surprise was +10.07%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks.\nPower needs for artificial intelligence and cloud computing are expanding so rapidly that some data center campuses may use more electricity than entire cities, or even states, CNBC reports. Here is what Ali Fenn, president of Lancium, a company that secures land and power for data centers had to say about technology companies:\n\"Technology companies are in a \u201crace of a lifetime to global dominance\u201d in artificial intelligence. It\u2019s frankly about national security and economic security.

According to developers, natural gas will also have to play a role. In turn, this need will slow down the progress towards meeting carbon dioxide emission targets. Nat Sahlstrom, chief energy officer at Tract, a Denver-based company that secures land, infrastructure, and power resources for such facilities, further reveals how data center companies have already begun operating at a scale where they have started \u201ctapping out against the existing utility infrastructure\u201d.\nIn other news, Uber is reportedly building a fleet of gig workers for labeling data for AI models. The new data labeling division, known as Scaled Solutions, will have workers complete projects for the company's internal business units as well as serve outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic, according to a report from Bloomberg.\u00a0 The ride-hailing company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the U.S., Canada, and India, among others.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\nHere is Why Warren Buffett Sold AAPL Stock\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide. Apple Intelligence is the company\u2019s personal intelligence system. Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley maintained a Buy rating on Apple, with a price target of $273.00, on Monday, November 25th. The firm states that its survey checks \u201creinforce [the] multi-year iPhone upgrade thesis.\u201d A survey by the firm has found that 78% of potential buyers of AI-enabled iPhones would pay a monthly subscription, potentially boosting Apple\u2019s services revenue by $7-14 billion by 2027. The company is also improving its position in China, despite Wall Street\u2019s concerns about increasing smartphone competition from domestic players like Huawei.\n\u201cOur 2024 AlphaWise Global Smartphone Survey confirms that iPhone upgrade rates are improving and Apple Intelligence is an emerging catalyst to iPhone upgrades, with broader availability key to unlocking pent-up demand globally\u201d.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the buzzing AI stocks that are making headlines.

          "whole_article": "People walk past an Apple Inc. retail store in New York City. (Credit: ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images files)\nOne of the best ways to achieve success in the stock market is to look for \u201ccompounders,\u201d that is, companies that have the ability to earn high returns and then earn high returns on those high returns. Most investors have some understanding of the concept of compounding interest, or earning interest on interest. Compounding stocks work the same way, when companies make profits and then re-invest those profits and make an ever-increasing amount of money by making money on those profits, again and again, over decades.\nA compounding stock is a beautiful thing. Suppose a company can grow its earnings at 20 per cent a year. If we start at $1.00 per share in earnings, then after year one, earnings are $1.20. But now in the second year it makes 20 per cent on $1.20, if no dividends are paid out. So, after two years, earnings are now $1.44, after three years, $1.72. The math is incredibly powerful. At this rate, in 20 years earnings would grow to $33 per share. It\u2019s easy to see that a big stock gain would follow this sort of earnings growth.\nSo, if we have convinced you of the math, how do you go about finding a compounder? This is the tough part. Of course, looking for a quality company with good management is always a good start. But let\u2019s look at five other factors that might help identify a future compounder.\nTechnological advantage\nDoes the company have a technology no one else can offer? A technology breakthrough is a great start if a company wants to be a compounder. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google search engine is a good example, so much so that the U.S. government wants to limit its global dominance with recent moves to try to break up the company. Or, think of a satellite company. Obviously, not just anyone can send satellites up and provide communications and data services from space.\nBrand loyalists\nDoes the company offer a new, or better, service, or have a solid brand reputation that attracts and retains customer loyalty? Perhaps its products are viewed so highly that customers just keep coming back and competitors cannot make any inroads? Apple Inc., for example, may not have a technological moat, but its customers are absolutely fierce loyalists to the company and its products. Its brand is likely one of the most valuable in the world \u2014 and it shows in the company\u2019s financial numbers. Spotify Technology SA, interestingly, is another example, as Apple itself is a strong competitor. But Spotify\u2019s music streaming service came earlier than Apple\u2019s, and most would agree that Spotify offers the better service. So, despite Apple\u2019s strength in other areas and its massive financial clout, Spotify still has a larger market share of the music business than Apple does.\nStory Continues\nScale advantage\nDid the company have a head start in the industry and thus achieved scale to such an extent that it now benefits from lower costs, which makes it very difficult for competitors or startups to enter the business? Amazon.com Inc. is the easiest example here, at least in North America. From its early days selling books, the company has expanded to just about every product imaginable, and can typically deliver the next day. It spent billions on its network over decades to achieve scale and improve margins. Its scale is simply massive, and we certainly do not see many new competitors starting up trying to compete with it. It lost a lot of money in its early days, but now is a dominant player in several business areas, generating lots of cash and making it hard for competitors to make inroads.\nProtected market\nDoes the company have a protected, regulated market with the government and regulators simply limiting any possible future competition? There has been a lot of talk recently about uranium and rare-earth metals. With China and other countries controlling much of the production of these products, the United States is starting to get paranoid about security of supply for these important elements. Thus, simply having a resource deposit in North America could be a competitive advantage for companies. A simpler example is a drug company which develops a new product. Not only do drugs need government regulatory approval to even be sold, they also get a 20-year patent. That\u2019s a pretty strong moat.\nBarriers to switching\nFactors that can make a stock expensive but still a good buy\nReasons a stock might move in a direction you didn't expect\nAre products so embedded with customers that switching costs are too high or switching companies is just too difficult for customers? This is fairly common in the software industry. Once a company goes through the time, cost and hassle of implementing a new software system across its entire network, it is really hard for a competitor to come in and say, \u201cHey, if you get rid of all those systems it took two years to install and to train staff, we can do it cheaper.\u201d When faced with software and operating systems, price is not often the big motivator. Companies want systems that work and are exceptionally reluctant to switch. Thus, large incumbent companies tend to have a very big advantage in this sector.\nPeter Hodson, CFA, is founder of 5i Research Inc., an independent investment research network helping do-it-yourself investors reach their investment goals.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Australia\u2019s core inflation is \u201ctoo high\u201d to consider interest-rate cuts in the near term, Reserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock said, reiterating that there\u2019s still some way to go before prices return sustainably to target.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIn Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes\nIn Italy\u2019s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing\nNew York City\u2019s \u2018Living Breakwaters\u2019 Brace for Stormier Seas\n\u201cThe word \u2018sustainably\u2019 is important because it recognizes that we need to look through temporary factors that influence the headline inflation rate,\u201d Bullock said Thursday in a speech in Sydney. She pointed out that forecasts show a \u201csustainable return\u201d of underlying inflation to target occurring in 2026, after it came in at 3.5% last quarter.\nThe governor\u2019s comments reinforce the RBA\u2019s outlier status in the developed world. Her suggestion that Australian borrowers shouldn\u2019t expect an easing in the near term come at a time when the Federal Reserve, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Bank of Korea and others are already on rate reduction paths.\nThe RBA\u2019s key difference with counterparts, Bullock said, is that its policy settings are comparatively less restrictive. That\u2019s due to its desire to preserve job gains and engineer a soft landing while bringing down prices.\nThe central bank\u2019s latest forecasts published this month show its preferred trimmed mean gauge of inflation will return to the 2-3% target at the end of 2025 and hit the 2.5% midpoint in late 2026. The governor also noted that Australia\u2019s labor market has proved resilient with unemployment at a low 4.1%.\n\u201cGiven the tightness in Australia\u2019s labor market, along with our assessment that the level of demand still exceeds supply in the broader economy, we expect it will take a little longer for inflation to settle at target,\u201d Bullock said.\nThe RBA next meets on Dec. 9-10, when it\u2019s widely expected to leave the cash rate at a 13-year high of 4.35%. Money market pricing implies rate reductions will begin in May 2025, though most economists are still penciling in a February start to easing.\nAsked after her speech about the timing of policy easing, Bullock pointed out that the RBA\u2019s central forecast \u2014 even though it has a very large error band \u2014 is that by the end of 2025 core inflation will be back below 3%.\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough just to be below 3%,\u201d she said, adding confidence in the movement is key. \u201cProvided we continue along that trajectory then we will be in a position at some point to consider whether its appropriate to cut rates.\u201d\nStory Continues\nSubscribe to The Bloomberg Australia Podcast on Apple, Spotify, on YouTube, or wherever you listen.\nQueried about the RBA\u2019s repeated comment about not ruling anything in or out on policy, Bullock stood by that approach. She pointed out that the world is very volatile at the moment, even though inflation in Australia has been gradually coming down.\n\u201cIf the data that we\u2019re seeing and the information we\u2019re getting from our liaison and so on suggests that inflation is picking up again, it\u2019s not going to follow that trajectory, it\u2019s going in another direction, then that would be a very big red flag for us,\u201d she said.\nSince the RBA stood pat at this month\u2019s meeting, data has pointed to a resilient economy with strengthening consumer and business sentiment, easing wage pressures and a still-strong labor market. A monthly gauge of headline inflation this week came in below expectations though core prices accelerated to 3.5%, reinforcing Bullock\u2019s point.\nElsewhere, the increased likelihood of trade conflicts under President-elect Donald Trump together with fighting in the Middle East and Ukraine are adding to market jitters. Bullock acknowledged the \u201congoing conflicts\u201d around the world and an \u201cever-changing geopolitical landscape,\u201d without delving into them.\n\u201cWe are ready to meet these challenges head-on,\u201d she said.\n(Adds governor\u2019s comments from Q&A in eighth to 11th paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

The e-commerce giant's impressive performance across key segments and strategic initiatives suggests this could be an opportune time for investors to consider adding AMZN to their portfolios.\nShare-Price Movement\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRobust Financial Performance\nThe company delivered outstanding financial results, with earnings per share of $1.43, representing a dramatic 52.1% increase year over year. Revenues climbed to $158.9 billion, marking 11% growth compared to the previous year, while operating income reached a record $17.4 billion, surging 56% year over year. These strong numbers underscore Amazon's ability to execute effectively while maintaining profitability.\nAWS and AI Leadership\nAmazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) continues to be a primary growth driver, achieving a significant 19.1% year-over-year revenue increase to reach $27.5 billion, with an impressive $110 billion annualized run rate. The company's AI initiatives are particularly noteworthy, with AWS' AI business growing at a triple-digit rate year over year. The introduction of new foundation models through Amazon Bedrock, including partnerships with Anthropic, Meta Platforms META, and Mistral, positions Amazon at the forefront of the AI revolution.\n\nDespite being the dominant player in the cloud market, the company faces strong competition from cloud giants like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google, which are also making concerted efforts to power their cloud solutions with GenAI.\nE-commerce Strength and Innovation\nThe company's core retail business shows strong momentum, with the North America segment\u2019s revenues increasing 9% to $95.5 billion and the International segment\u2019s revenue growing 12% to $35.9 billion. Amazon's focus on operational efficiency is evident in its improved delivery speeds, with more than 40 million customers receiving same-day delivery in the past quarter. The successful Prime Big Deal Days event and enhanced Prime benefits, including fuel savings programs, demonstrate the company's commitment to customer value.\nAdvertising Growth and Expansion\nAmazon's advertising services continue to impress, generating $14.3 billion in revenues, with an 18.8% year-over-year growth. The company's entry into the broadcast season for Prime Video advertising and implementation of AI-powered creative tools showcase its innovation in this high-margin business segment.\nStory Continues\nStrategic Investments and Future Growth\nLooking ahead, Amazon's planned $75 billion capital expenditure for 2024 signals confidence in future growth opportunities. The company's expansion of Amazon Pharmacy to cover nearly half of the United States by 2025 and significant investments in AI infrastructure demonstrate its commitment to long-term value creation.\nInvestment Case\nAmazon presents a compelling investment opportunity, driven by its demonstrated operational excellence through consistent margin improvements across major segments. The company's strong position in AI technology and cloud services, coupled with its successful diversification across e-commerce, advertising and healthcare, creates multiple growth vectors. Amazon's robust financial health, evidenced by a 57% increase in operating cash flow to $112.7 billion and free cash flow growth to $47.7 billion, provides ample resources for future innovations and market expansion, making it an attractive option for growth-focused investors.\n\nWhile Amazon's forward 12-month Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of 3.09X appears higher than the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry average of 1.8X, this premium valuation is well justified by the company's exceptional market position and growth prospects. The slightly elevated multiple compared to its historical median of 2.8X reflects investors' confidence in Amazon's robust ecosystem and diverse revenue streams.\n\nThe premium valuation is supported by Amazon's significant competitive advantages, including its dominant position in e-commerce, rapidly growing cloud computing business and expanding advertising segment. When considering the company's strong execution, impressive margin improvements and substantial investments in future growth areas like AI, the current valuation offers an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to a market leader with multiple growth catalysts.\nAMZN\u2019s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLooking Forward\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Amazon projects net sales between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, representing a 7-11% growth rate. The company's operating income is expected to range between $16 billion and $20 billion, showing continued strength in profitability.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is pegged at $187.07 billion, indicating growth of 10.06% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share, which indicates a jump of 47.52% from the year-ago quarter. The figure has moved north by 8.8% over the past 30 days.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Recommendation\nGiven Amazon's strong financial performance, leadership in key growth areas like AI and cloud computing, operational improvements and healthy future outlook, the recent stock price increase appears justified and may represent just the beginning of a longer-term upward trend. The company's robust ecosystem, diverse revenue streams and strategic investments in future growth areas make it an attractive option for investors looking for both growth and stability in their portfolios.\n\nFor investors seeking exposure to technology, e-commerce and AI sectors, Amazon's current position and forward-looking strategy make it a compelling buy, particularly for those with a long-term investment horizon.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The significant move by the FED to cut the interest rate helped the market to stabilize. In the quarter, the fund appreciated 6.19% (net), outperforming its benchmark, the S&P 500 Index, which returned 5.89%, and its secondary benchmark, the CBOE S&P 500 Buy/Write Index\u2019s 5.54% return.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores that operate through North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) segments.\u00a0The one-month return of Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading e-commerce company that operates a vast online marketplace for third-party sellers, sells its own products, and provides cloud infrastructure services through Amazon Web Services (AWS). We own Amazon because we believe AWS and advertising will continue to drive long-term revenue growth and profitability improvements. Although the stock didn't perform well this quarter, we attribute this to a mix of short-term factors, including macroeconomic headwinds impacting consumer and enterprise spending, slowing retail revenue growth, and retail margin expansion falling short of market expectations. Additionally, increased investment in longer-term initiatives like satellite broadband and other experimental projects put further pressure on margins. Despite weaker-than-expected third-quarter guidance, we believe Amazon\u2019s long-term growth story remains strong. We see multiple levers for improved profitability and free cash flow generation over time.

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this online retailer have returned +10.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.3%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.19 points to a change of +79% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +9.3%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.21 indicates a change of +19.7% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.7%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $187.07 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.1%. The $637.22 billion and $706.34 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.9% and +10.9%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $158.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11%. EPS of $1.43 for the same period compares with $0.85 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $157.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.15%. The EPS surprise was +25.44%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "America's malls have opened their doors for another Black Friday \u2014 but it's not the 2000s anymore with lines snaked around store entrances, and that has cast dark clouds over some department stores' futures.\n\"The whole Christmas shopping experience is totally different now\" due to the likes of retail behemoths Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT), Morningstar analyst David Swartz said.\nPlus, off-price retailers such as Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Companies (TJX), which owns TJ Maxx and Marshall's, \"are taking sales away from department stores constantly,\" Swartz added.\nMacy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), and Nordstrom (JWN) are fighting to stay in the game by closing lagging stores and pouring money into online operations.\nHowever, legacy department stores have still fallen behind digitally, and questions remain about whether they'll continue to be public companies in the future amid evolving shopper patterns and high operating costs.\nSame-store sales dropped 1.3% in Macy's preliminary third quarter results. Net sales fell 2.4% to $4.74 billion. Yahoo Finance data shows analysts expect Macy's will report $22.1 billion in sales for 2024 \u2014 if hit, that would be about $3 billion less than in calendar year 2021.\nKohl's third quarter net sales fell 8.8% to $3.5 billion. Same-store sales declined 9.3%, dragged down by softness in apparel and footwear. The company booted its CEO, Thomas Kingsbury.\nKohl's is expected to reach $15.8 billion in sales this year, which would be down by roughly $4 billion from calendar year 2021.\nNordstrom's third quarter same-store sales grew 4% for the namesake brand. Sales at its off-price business, Nordstrom Rack, grew 3.9%.\nShares of all three retailers trade on a paltry forward price-to-earnings multiple of 8 times, according to Yahoo Finance analysis, a sizable discount to the 22.5 times afforded to the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\nAnalysts estimate Nordstrom's full-year sales at $14.8 billion, about on par with calendar year 2021.\nInvestors in all three chains should expect a flat to low-single-digit sales decline for the holiday season, CFRA analyst Zach Warring told Yahoo Finance.\nBy comparison, the National Retail Federation (NRF) projects consumers to spend between 2.5% and 3.5% more than last year during the holidays.\n\"Consumers are looking for value more than ever,\" JCPenney CEO Marc Rosen said on a phone call with Yahoo Finance. \"What's evolved ... is how consumers view value.\"\nWall Street punishes the struggling sector\nShares of Macy's have dropped 19% this year to around $16 per share, compared to a $24.80 per share buyout offer it rejected in July.\nStory Continues\nThe S&P 500 is up 27% on the year.\nMacy's CEO Tony Spring is trying to turn around the business with a plan it unveiled in February dubbed \"Bold New Chapter.\" The playbook includes investments online and in the company's top-performing stores. It also involves shuttering 150 underperforming stores by 2026 and more layoffs.\n\"If I told everyone that I had a business, that we could be in the cosmetics business, we could be in the women's apparel business, we could be in the men's business, we could be in the home business, we could be in the electronics business, you might call that a marketplace, and a marketplace is very attractive to people,\" Spring explained at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference earlier this month.\nThe results have been mixed.\nThe company said in its preliminary release this week that in the 50 stores where Macy's has invested in better staffing, product assortment, and visual displays, third quarter same-store sales grew for the third straight quarter, up 1.9% year over year.\nThe company didn't disclose third quarter online sales, but online sales for the second quarter fell 7% from the prior year to $1.43 billion.\n\u2022 USD\n(M)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nMeanwhile, Kohl's stock has crashed 46% this year.\nA drop in foot traffic, a pullback in investing in private apparel brands, and the removal of fine jewelry to make room for in-store Sephora cosmetics shops have been detrimental to sales growth, Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group wrote in a note to clients.\nThe retailer plans to reintroduce fine jewelry to 200 stores this holiday season.\nKohl's also needs a more structured online business that was once \"way too promotional,\" Morningstar's Swartz said.\nThe retailer said this month that Ashley Buchanan will be its next CEO, the third since 2018. He'll take the helm in January.\nNordstrom has been performing better compared to its department store peers as it leans into e-commerce.\nJefferies analyst Ashley Helgans said that Nordstrom has benefited from \"leading with brands first and price second.\" The company has also focused on \"improving selection and depth of customers' favorite brands,\" from Decker's (DECK) running sneaker brand Hoka and On Holding's (ONON) performance shoes to dressy and contemporary men's apparel brands.\nBut Nordstrom is still staying cautious this holiday season.\nThe company noted an \"uncertain\" external environment when it reported earnings earlier this month and reaffirmed its full-year profit guidance.\n\"Across all of our businesses ... we saw a slowing in the trends\" starting the last week of October, CEO Erik Nordstrom said on an earnings call.\nNordstrom shares have jumped 22% to $22.62 amid a buyout proposal.\nThe future of department stores\nAll three companies will likely go private to stay out of Wall Street's penalizing gaze, per Swartz.\nIn September, Nordstrom's founding family teamed up with retail investor El Puerto de Liverpool to take the company private. The two parties own 33% and 10% of the company, respectively, and the group is offering $23 per share or $3.8 billion for the rest. Nordstrom's board acknowledged the offer but has not yet announced a decision.\n\"Given the way that the deal is structured ... there's a very good chance that it does get completed,\" Swartz said.\nBoth Macy's and Kohl's have rebuffed buyout offers within the past two years, reasoning more value could be achieved by executing their turnaround plans.\nBut time is ticking, and industry dynamics are only intensifying. It's plausible Macy's and Kohl's entertain offers in the future to get certainty for shareholders.\n\"Another hedge fund or private equity [firm] ... is going to say, ...'Wow, this is dirt cheap. I can buy this company and extract all kinds of value from it,'\" Swartz said.\n\"That's still the case for both Kohl's and Macy's,\" he said. \"They still have real estate. They still generate cash flow, their valuations are still extremely depressed, so they're still attractive.\"\nHow the holiday season shakes out may force their hands.\n\u2014\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other top stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months.\nOn November 25, the stock market saw a significant surge, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping 440 points to a new record close of 44,736.57. The S&P 500 also reached a new high, gaining 0.3% to 5,987.37, while the Russell 2000 index, which focuses on small-cap stocks, hit an all-time high, increasing 1.47% to 2,442.03. The Nasdaq also rose, closing 0.27% higher at 19,054.84. CNBC reported that the market\u2019s strong performance was attributed to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Scott Bessent, the founder of Key Square Group, as Treasury secretary. Investors are optimistic that Bessent, a hedge fund manager, will be supportive of the equity market and help mitigate some of Trump\u2019s protectionist policies, such as his stance on tariffs.\nUS Stocks Poised for Continued Growth\nIn an interview with CNBC on November 25, Brian Belski, Chief Investment Officer at BMO Capital Markets, expressed his bullish stance on the US stock market, stating that it remains the best asset in the world. He emphasized that despite the negativity and doubts surrounding the market, his team has consistently maintained a bullish stance since 2009.\nBelski pointed out that many investors are too focused on valuation, which he believes is the world\u2019s worst metric for predicting forward performance. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of earnings growth consistency, where the US is expected to outperform other regions.\nHe also highlighted the potential for catch-up growth in the financial sector, particularly in the areas of scale, asset managers, and discretionary spending. His team\u2019s research suggests that earnings in the US financial sector are massively understated, and he expects a big catch-up trade on the earnings front.\nRegarding valuation, Belski dismissed the idea of assigning a specific valuation metric, such as a P/E ratio, as simplistic. Instead, his team uses a macro P/E longer-term trend and a dividend discount model to evaluate the market. He believes the S&P 500 can reach 6,700, driven by US growth and earnings consistency.\nBrian Belski has been bullish on small-cap stocks for well over a year and believes small-cap stocks are a good value play. He also implies that small-cap stocks are undervalued, citing various valuation metrics such as price-to-sales, and price-to-book, as well as operating metrics such as return on assets and return on equity. He suggests that these metrics indicate that small-cap stocks are a good value investment opportunity.\nStory Continues\nThe US stock market continues to show resilience and strength, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 reaching new highs. The nomination of Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary has injected a sense of optimism into the market. With the market\u2019s strong performance and positive outlook, investors are well-positioned to take advantage of the current trend. With that in context, let\u2019s take a look at the top 8 stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the top 8 stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s database to research stocks in 8 different sectors. We picked stocks from different sectors that were the most popular among elite money managers. The final list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nWhy Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is the Top Stock to Buy in 8 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months?\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 286\nSector: Consumer Cyclical\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global e-commerce and technology company, through Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company has transformed the retail industry and continues to broaden its influence through innovative technology and logistics. The company offers convenience, fast delivery, and an extensive product range.\nOn October 31, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) released its financial results for the third quarter ending September 30. The company reported net sales of $158.9 billion, reflecting an 11% year-over-year increase, and a remarkable $15.3 billion in net profit, a 54.54% rise compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced a significant investment in its Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program. In North America, the company is investing $2.1 billion, whereas in Japan, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making an investment of $161.95 million to support last-mile delivery innovation, safety, and technology for drivers.\nAmazon.com, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) pharmacy arm, Amazon Pharmacy, is accelerating its rollout of new pharmacies, aiming to offer fast and free delivery of prescription medications, by the end of 2025, nearly half of US customers are expected to be eligible for Same-Day Delivery of their prescription medications.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of top stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Roku (ROKU). Shares have added about 5.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Roku due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nROKU Q3 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Revenues Increase Y/Y\nRoku reported third-quarter 2024 loss of 6 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents. The company had incurred a loss of $2.33 per share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues increased 16.47% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to $1.062 billion and beat the consensus mark by 4.37%. Growth of The Roku Channel\u2019s streaming households and streaming hours drove third-quarter performance. Roku\u2019s streaming households and streaming hours grew 13% and 20%, respectively, year over year.\n\nStreaming Households were 85.5 million, representing a net increase of 2 million from the second quarter of 2024. The Roku Home Screen, which is the beginning of viewers\u2019 streaming experience, reaches U.S. households with more than 120 million people every day, reflecting greater engagement and more monetization opportunities.\n\nThe Roku operating system (OS) was again the #1 selling TV OS in the United States, with TV unit sales greater than the next two TV operating systems combined. The Roku OS was also the #1 selling TV OS in Mexico and Canada.\n\nGlobally, users streamed a record 32 billion hours in the third quarter, up 20% hours from the prior quarter.\n\nThe average revenue per user remained flat year over year at $41.1 (on a trailing 12-month basis).\n\nThe Roku Channel remained the #3 app on Roku\u2019s platform in the third quarter by both reach and engagement, with Streaming Hours up nearly 80% year over year. This ongoing growth is largely due to the company\u2019s position as the lead-in to TV and Home Screen\u2019s power to drive viewership. The Roku Channel\u2019s Nielsens\u2019 The Gauge hit an all-time high ranking for August 2024, representing 4.1% of total TV streaming time in the United States. Roku launched Roku Sports Channel in August providing viewers with free sports content. Good Morning Football: Overtime, a new extension series of NFL Network\u2019s long-running Good Morning Football was also added to the Roku Channel.\nQuarter Details\nPlatform revenues (85.5% of revenues) increased 15.43% year over year to $908.2 million, driven by contributions from streaming services distribution and advertising activities, despite continued softness within the media and entertainment vertical.\n\nDevices revenues (14.5% of revenues) rose 23% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to $154 million.\nStory Continues\nOperating Details\nGross margin, as a percentage of total revenues, expanded 476 basis points from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to 45.2%.\n\nOperating expenses decreased 28.22% year over year to $515.83 million. As a percentage of total revenues, the metric contracted to 48.56% from 78.79% reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nResearch & development and sales & marketing expenses decreased 36.64% and 22.96% on a year-over-year basis to $178.79 million and $237.04 million, respectively. General & administrative expenses increased 22.3% to $99.9 million.\n\nIn the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $98.2 million against adjusted EBITDA of $43.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Roku reported the fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and trailing 12-month free cash flow.\n\nOperating loss was $35.8 million in the reported quarter compared with an operating loss of $349.8 million in the year-ago quarter.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $2.12 billion compared with $2.05 billion as of June 30, 2024. As of Sept 30, 2024, Roku had no long-term debt.\nGuidance\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, ROKU expects total net revenues of $1.14 billion, total gross profit of roughly $465 million and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.\nVGM Scores\nCurrently, Roku has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nRoku has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\nPerformance of an Industry Player\nRoku is part of the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry. Over the past month, Netflix (NFLX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 16.1%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2024 more than a month ago.\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of B.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

          "whole_article": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - Netflix won the dismissal on Tuesday of a shareholder lawsuit accusing the streaming company of downplaying the impact on subscriber growth of account sharing, where paying members share user names and passwords with nonpaying members in other households.\nThe proposed class action led by a Texas-based trustee began after Netflix revealed in April 2022 it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the prior quarter, the first decline in a decade, and might lose 2 million more in the next three months.\nNetflix blamed the decline on several factors, including account sharing, rising competition and a shutdown of service in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Its shares fell 35% the next day, wiping out more than $54 billion of market value.\nU.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in Oakland, California, however, said Netflix's earlier claims to be \"roughly 60% penetrated\" in the United States and Canada with \"a lot of headroom\" to grow were not false or misleading, because they referred to paid subscribers and did not imply that growth was certain.\nHe also found no proof Netflix concealed any determination that account sharing would severely hinder growth.\n\"At most,\" he said, the plaintiff's allegations suggest that the Los Gatos, California-based company investigated account sharing and found it to be \"one potential threat to growth among many.\"\nLawyers for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Netflix and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.\nTigar had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit in January. Tuesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, the trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, cannot amend his complaint again.\nThe case is Pirani v Netflix Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-02672. (This story has been refiled to change the location of the judge to Oakland, California, from San Francisco, in paragraph 4)\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about as heading into December.\nJim Cramer in a recent program talked about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Treasury pick and highlighted his enthusiasm for the stock market.\n\u201cOn the other hand, President Trump was all about Nielsen ratings when he was on\u00a0The Apprentice,\u00a0and as president, he repeatedly said, The Dow Jones Industrial Average all-time high, and the S&P 500 were his new Nielsen ratings. He likes being rated, he likes to win, and he wants that stock market to go up to ratify his performance. That\u2019s a big reason why the market exploded higher when he won.\u201d\nCramer also discussed Trump\u2019s Treasury pick Scott Bessent\u2019s possible 3-3-3 plan that calls for bringing the budget deficit down to 3% of GDP, 3% growth and producing 3 million barrels of oil per day.\nJim Cramer said he is skeptical about Elon Musk\u2019s efficiency plans in the upcoming Trump administration.\n\u201cCan there be a legitimate top-to-bottom change in the efficiency of our government and its associated costs? Count me as a skeptic about any attempt to change the government, including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s Doge thing, because every penny of spending in the budget has a constituency. When you add all those proposed cutbacks together, you face tremendous opposition. But that\u2019s not the point. What matters is that this Treasury Secretary-designate is a serious person.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he is talking about. With each stock we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nJim Cramer Says Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Price Not Capturing \u2018Seismic Shift\u2019 Happening in Market\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 193\nTalking about one of his favorite stocks, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in a latest program, Jim Cramer said:\nStory Continues\n\u201cFrankly, I\u2019ve never seen anything like what\u2019s happening at Nvidia. Never, just never. And even though the stock was down despite 19 firms raising their price targets this morning, I said this stock is simply not capturing the seismic shift that\u2019s happening here. You see, Nvidia is disrupting everything we know.\u201d\nSimply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia\u2019s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers \u2014 which account for 50% of its revenue \u2014 are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn a reversal from the past two quarters,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about as heading into December. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

ISG segment sales hit a quarterly record of $11.4 billion, soaring 34% from the comparative quarter thanks to servers and networking revenue of $7.4 billion, a 58% spike from a year ago.\nOn the bottom line, Q3 earnings of $2.15 per share was up 14% from EPS of $1.88 in the prior-year quarter and eclipsed expectations of $2.06. More intriguing, Dell has now surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for 11 consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 10.44% in its last four quarterly reports.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDell\u2019s PC Demand Warning (Guidance)\nWith Hewlett Packard\u2019s results approaching next week, investors may want to take heed of Dell\u2019s weaker-than-expected revenue guidance. Citing weaker demand for traditional PCs and increased competition, Dell\u2019s Q4 sales guidance of $24-$25 billion came short of most analyst expectations with the current Zacks Consensus at $25.27 billion or 13% growth.\nHPE Q4 Expectations\nReporting results for its fiscal fourth quarter next week, Hewlett Packard\u2019s Q4 sales are thought to have increased 12% to $8.23 billion compared to $7.35 billion in the prior-year period. Q4 earnings are expected to rise 6% to $0.55 per share versus EPS of $0.52 a year ago.\nNotably, Hewlett Packard\u2019s server revenue most recently soared 35% during its fiscal third quarter to $4.3 billion. Overall, Q3 sales rose 10% YoY to $7.71 billion and edged estimates of $7.66 billion. Furthermore, Hewlett Packard has reached or exceeded earnings expectations for nine straight quarters with an average EPS surprise of 7.48% in its last four quarterly reports.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTracking DELL & HPE Stock\nStarting to highlight their improved financial metrics, Dell\u2019s stock is up more than +60% this year with Hewlett Packard shares up a very respectable +25%. It\u2019s also noteworthy that DELL and HPE have outperformed the broader indexes over the last three years with investor sentiment remaining high in regards to their partnerships with Nvidia.\nStory Continues\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLeading to the potential argument that Dell and Hewlett Packard may be cheaper alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s dominance among the AI realm is their attractive valuations. To that point, DELL trades at 15.8X forward earnings with HPE at just 9.9X compared to NVDA at 46.2X.\nDELL and HPE also trade at considerable discounts to the S&P 500\u2019s 25.3X forward earnings multiple and well beneath the optimum level of less than 2X sales.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile weaker PC demand may be keeping Dell and Hewlett Packard from firing on all cylinders, it\u2019s hard to overlook their stocks for exposure to AI.

Intel turned down to invest, but later on it contracted TSMC to make CPUs for its newest models, according to a Reuters report, citing the memoir.\nSince 2021, Chang noted, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has worked on turning Intel into a foundry player. Chang, however, had doubts about the strategy, pointing up Intel's long-standing internal chip manufacturing methodology as a possible barrier.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

It wasn't just a casual pitch. Chang laid out a 10-minute vision for Taiwan Semiconductor's future, convinced Huang's industry smarts and leadership chops made him the perfect successor. But Huang? He shut it down, quick, with a polite, I already have a job. That job, of course, was running Nvidia. And oh, how that decision paid off. Nvidia exploded into the AI juggernaut it is today, while Taiwan Semiconductor thrived under new leadership, cementing itself as the chipmaking kingpin for giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with TSM.\nThis moment is more than just a fun anecdoteit's a masterclass in leadership and strategy. Huang's decision to stick with Nvidia wasn't just loyalty; it was foresight. By doubling down on Nvidia's potential, he steered the company to a $1 trillion market cap, driven by insatiable AI demand. Meanwhile, Chang's knack for partnerships and market positioning turned Taiwan Semiconductor into the semiconductor backbone of the digital economy. It's no coincidence these two companies remain tethered, with Taiwan Semiconductor producing Nvidia's cutting-edge chips. Their trajectories highlight the power of staying the course and playing to your strengthsa lesson Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is now trying to catch up on as it chases the foundry crown.\nFor investors, this is a clear signal: Leadership decisions aren't just boardroom dramathey're market movers. Chang and Huang's mutual respect and strategic brilliance laid the groundwork for today's AI and semiconductor boom. Nvidia's rise in AI and Taiwan Semiconductor's dominance in chipmaking didn't happen by luckit happened because of visionary calls like these. The takeaway? Bet on the leaders who see not just the game ahead but the game-changing partnerships that will take them there.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on NVDA. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)'s share was trading at $136.92 as of Nov 26th. NVDA\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 54.05 and 32.57 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nAn exterior view of a busy data centre, showing the scale and workflows of the company.\nNvidia\u2019s recent earnings report highlights the company\u2019s remarkable growth, with a total revenue of $35.1 billion, an increase of 17% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. This performance surpassed the $32.5 billion forecast, driven by robust growth across all segments, particularly in the Data Center division, which saw a staggering 112% year-over-year increase, reaching $30.8 billion in revenue. This surge was primarily fueled by the success of Nvidia's Hopper and H200 chips, with H200 sales contributing billions. Net income followed suit, rising 109% to $19.3 billion, further solidifying Nvidia\u2019s financial dominance. Despite these impressive results, concerns linger regarding Nvidia's dependency on Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle. Half of the company\u2019s Data Center sales were tied to CSPs, a figure that has remained stable across recent quarters. This heavy reliance on CSPs raises questions about the sustainability of Nvidia\u2019s growth, particularly as these providers face capital expenditure (CapEx) limits that could constrain future expansion.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s Data Center segment continues to perform well, especially with its foray into sovereign AI and consumer internet companies, its increasing dependency on CSPs presents challenges. These CSPs are nearing their CapEx limits, leading to concerns about their ability to continue ramping up expenditures on AI infrastructure. Moreover, as CSPs\u2019 Free Cash Flow (FCF) aligns closely with their CapEx, the balance between AI workload growth and investors\u2019 return expectations will become a tightrope for these companies to walk. On a slightly negative note, Nvidia reported a sequential dip in networking revenue, despite a strong push to offer a comprehensive full-stack solution that includes GPUs, CPUs, and networking for supercomputers. Although networking revenue showed a 20% year-over-year increase, the sequential dip raised doubts about the segment's growth trajectory. Nvidia addressed this by suggesting that networking revenue will likely see sequential growth in the next quarter as newer systems, including Blackwell chips, begin to ramp up. However, this uncertainty adds an element of caution to Nvidia's broader performance outlook.\nStory Continues\nAnother area of concern is Nvidia's gross margin, which dipped slightly to 74.6%, a decrease from the previous quarter, attributed to the shift towards more complex and higher-cost systems. Nvidia anticipates that margins will continue to moderate into the low 70s as Blackwell chips are fully deployed by the second half of 2025. This moderation raises questions about the company's ability to maintain its premium pricing, especially as older chips like the H100, once highly sought after, experience rapid depreciation. As newer, more cost-efficient chips such as the H200 and Blackwell come to market, Nvidia will need to navigate increasing competition and manage customer expectations regarding pricing and performance.\nAn interesting development in Nvidia\u2019s strategy is the shift from focusing solely on pre-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) to a broader emphasis on post-training and inference scaling. This change suggests that the incremental performance gains in LLMs from pre-training may be diminishing, prompting Nvidia to explore new methods to scale AI models. This shift could present new challenges, especially in the use of synthetic data, which some experts question as a sufficient driver of further AI advancements. Despite these hurdles, Nvidia\u2019s innovations in industrial AI, particularly robotics, are gaining momentum. The company\u2019s NeMo and Omniverse platforms are already enabling large manufacturers to integrate AI into industrial robotics. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the \"age of robotics is coming,\" signaling a significant growth opportunity for Nvidia in this rapidly expanding market. Additionally, Nvidia is advancing multimodal AI, focusing on processing video, image, and sensory data, which could unlock new potential for AI applications.\nLooking to the future, Nvidia\u2019s addressable market is vast, with the transition from traditional CPU-based computing to AI-driven machine learning workloads poised to accelerate. The company\u2019s GPUs will be critical in powering the next generation of data centers as they evolve to support AI models and training. By 2030, the global data center market is expected to exceed several trillion dollars, with machine learning and AI driving much of the growth. Nvidia\u2019s role in this transformation is central, and its leadership in GPUs positions the company to capture a significant share of this expanding market. With a projected annual growth rate of 59%, Nvidia could generate $1.65 trillion in revenue from the data center market over the next four years. By 2028, the company\u2019s total revenue could reach $600 billion, with net income hitting $300 billion, assuming it maintains its current net margins. However, the shift towards post-training and inference scaling introduces uncertainties, particularly in the pricing-sensitive inference market. Despite these challenges, Nvidia\u2019s strong financial position and strategic focus on AI, robotics, and multimodal capabilities suggest that the company is well-equipped to maintain its leadership in AI infrastructure.\nIn summary, Nvidia\u2019s earnings report underscores its strong financial performance and leadership in AI and data centers, but it also highlights growing concerns about its dependence on CSPs, the potential slowdown in pre-training for LLMs, and competitive pressures. While Nvidia is well-positioned for long-term growth, particularly with its expansion into industrial AI and multimodal capabilities, the company will need to navigate challenges in maintaining high margins and managing its pricing strategy in the evolving market for AI chips. The company\u2019s valuation, currently at $3.6 trillion, reflects high expectations, and future growth will depend on Nvidia\u2019s ability to sustain its momentum in a rapidly changing competitive landscape.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is on our list of the\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

          "whole_article": "The majority of U.S. stock indices ended in the red on Nov. 28, following an unfavorable inflation data release, reflecting an uptick in the nation\u2019s monthly consumer price.\nIn such a situation, an investor might not feel confident enough to invest in the stock market. However, a prudent investor knows that this is the right time to buy stocks that are safe bets. To this end, we recommend stocks like Fox Corp. FOX, Coastal Financial CCB, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Freshpet Inc. FRPT and InterDigital IDCC. These stocks bear low leverage and, therefore, should be a safer option for investors if they don\u2019t want to lose big in times of market turmoil.\nNow, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let\u2019s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.\nWhat\u2019s the Significance of Low-Leverage Stocks?\nIn finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.\nHowever, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to excessive debt financing.\nThe crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.\nThe equity market can be volatile at times, and, as an investor, if you don\u2019t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks that bear low leverage and are, hence, less risky.\nTo identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears. The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.\nAnalyzing Debt/Equity\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\nThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.\nWith the third-quarter earnings season behind us, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.\nThe Winning Strategy\nConsidering the factors above, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.\nStory Continues\nYet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.\nHere are the other parameters:\nDebt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\nPercentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock\u2019s price appreciation.\nVGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.\nEstimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.\nZacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.\nExcluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen.\nFOX: It produces and distributes news, sports and entertainment content. On Nov. 4, 2024, Fox Corp. released its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The company reported revenues of $3.56 billion, which reflected an increase of 11% year over year.

          "whole_article": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) have gained 1.9% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $135.34, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $173.06 indicates a potential upside of 27.9%.\nThe average comprises 42 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $123 to a high of $220, with a standard deviation of $17.86. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 9.1% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 62.6% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\nWhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.\nHowever, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in NVDA. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.\nHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\nStory Continues\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\nHere's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in NVDA\nThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current year, 14 estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days while one has gone lower. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 4.2%.\nMoreover, NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NVDA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After reports that the US was considering additional curbs on the export of advanced AI chips to Chinese companies, Beijing responded by saying it would take necessary actions to protect Chinese firms if the US escalated chip control measures. According to a report by news agency Reuters, when quizzed about reports that the US was planning to add 200 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist, a Chinese government spokesperson said China strongly opposes the US broadening the concept of national security, and the abuse of control measures targeting Chinese companies.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nHe Yadong, a commerce ministry spokesman, said that these actions severely disrupt the international economic and trade order, destabilise global industrial security, and harm the cooperative efforts between China and the US, as well as the global semiconductor industry, per Reuters. If the US insists on escalating control measures, China will take necessary actions to resolutely protect the legitimate rights of Chinese enterprises, he added.

The decision mandates Google to let competing app shops on its Play platform and to make its app library available to rivals. Set to be binding for three years, these amendments are on hold awaiting the scrutiny of the appeal court.\nGoogle said in its complaint that the jury should not have heard the case Epic Games, the creator of the video game \"Fortnite,\" file. Google said that the lawsuit aimed to limit Google's activities rather than seek damages. Google also objected to the court allowing Epic to claim that Apple (AAPL, Financials) and Google are not rivals in app distribution or in-app payment systems.\nThe legal conflict arises from a 2020 lawsuit in which Epic Games claimed Google was monopolizing Android device and payment system access. Last year, a San Francisco jury decided in favor of Epic, ruling Google had suppressed competition. Judge Donato ordered Google to carry out various changes based on the outcome, including allowing competing app shops.\nEpic, with its headquarters in Cary, North Carolina, deemed Google's plea to be unworthy. This meritless appeal is Google's desperate attempt to avoid complying with the unanimous jury decision, the company said.\nGoogle has not responded outside of its legal documentation. Enforcing the verdict, according to the business, would hurt customers and app developers and call for a \"dramatic redesign\" of its Android, mobile operating system, and Google Play marketplace.\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Feb. 3, with a decision expected later in the year.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Here is all the scoop on the tech stock:\nThings started to look bleak for Google\u2019s parent company after a judge said that Google had used exclusive deals to monopolize the search market illegally. In 2023, a top company executive testified during the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust trial that Google paid $26.3 billion to other companies to ensure its search engine was the default on web browsers and mobile phones.\nOn these grounds, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a document that suggested a breakup of the technology giant\u2019s Google search business, including selling its Chrome browser. It prohibits the ownership and control of anything that creates a preference for Google. The proposals, even though not a definitive plan, aim to reduce Google's dominance in the search market, leading to investor concerns about potential operational disruptions and future profitability.

Trump hasn\u2019t been a fan of Google, having recently said search results were biased against him. However, his current stance on Google is unclear. Meanwhile, the news about the search monopoly came in when investors were already worried about the rise of generative artificial intelligence.\nThese genAI technologies have created an opening for competitors like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft, making it easy to imagine a future where traditional search has faded and consumers are communicating with their devices via an AI-generated custom interface. The increased competition has raised concerns about Google's ability to maintain its market share and advertising revenue in the evolving technological landscape.\nAnother recently concluded case against Google by the Department of Justice is where Google was accused of illegally dominating online advertising technology markets.

It\u2019s one of the more dramatic actions in the history of an industry whose biggest stars are often locked into demanding, multi-year pacts \u2014 and are typically reluctant to protest publicly.\nHybe, best known for catapulting the careers of global sensation BTS, has lost more than $1 billion of its market value since April, when longtime NewJeans manager Min Hee-jin was sidelined by an internal company dispute. The group\u2019s members threatened in September to walk out unless Min was reinstated \u2014 a threat they\u2019ve since repeated and now made good on.\nThe action is likely to trigger a legal battle between the artists and Hybe, South Korea\u2019s largest and most influential music company.\n\u201cWe are well aware that from today we may not be able to use our current name NewJeans,\u201d NewJeans member Danielle said during the Youtube stream. \u201cHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that we are giving up on the name at all. We will continue to fight for new dreams regardless of our name. Just remember that NewJeans never dies.\u201d\nIn response, ADOR expressed regret over the group\u2019s decision and claimed the company has not violated the contract. With a few years left on their original agreement, that objection from the management company may result in legal actions that could drag on for months or years.\n\u201cThe exclusive agreement between ADOR and the NewJeans members remains in full effect,\u201d ADOR said in a statement via Hybe representatives. \u201cTherefore, we respectfully request that the group continue its collaboration with ADOR on upcoming activities, as has been the practice to date.\u201d\nA representative for NewJeans said the group may go through legal proceedings if necessary once they hire a lawyer. It is unclear how the group can continue their activities, whether through a new entity or with another record label.\nThe internal strife was sparked when Hybe accused Min of attempting to seize control of the label. She refuted the allegation and publicly denounced the studio.\nStory Continues\nMin, who owns an 18% stake in ADOR, was ordered by its board to step down from the top management role, while remaining a board member and producer. That\u2019s when NewJeans sent their ultimatum to Hybe, demanding the firm reinstate their ousted producer. Instead, Min stepped down from the board and left the company last week, warning of legal action.\nNewJeans debuted in 2022 as a five-member act and quickly became one of the most popular K-pop bands globally, with hits like Attention and Super Shy. The group helped the music label generate about 110 billion won ($79 million) of revenue last year, contributing to about 5% of Hybe\u2019s consolidated sales.\n\u201cWe would certainly love to continue working with Min if we can,\u201d said another member, Minji.\n--With assistance from Denny Thomas.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nWhy the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Microsoft (MSFT). Shares have added about 4.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Microsoft due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nMicrosoft Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates on Cloud Success\nMicrosoft reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings of $3.3 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.4% and improved 16% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nRevenues of $65.58 billion increased 16% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.82%. At constant currency (cc), revenues grew 16% year over year.\n\nIn commercial business, increased demand and growth in long-term commitments to Microsoft Cloud platform drove results.\n\nCommercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 30% (up 23% in cc). Results were driven by strong execution across core annuity sales motions and growth in the number of 10-million-dollar-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 (M365). The company saw an increase in the number of 100-million-dollar-plus contracts for Azure.\n\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 22% (up 21% in cc) to $259 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenues in the next 12 months, up 17% year over year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 27%. In the reported quarter, the annuity mix was 98%.\n\nMicrosoft also gained from in-period revenue recognition across Microsoft 365 commercial, Azure, and on-premises server business.\n\nFX did not have a significant impact on fiscal first-quarter results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenues, segment level revenues, COGS, and operating expense growth.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenues were $38.9 billion and grew 22%, roughly in line with expectations.\nSegmental Details\nThe Productivity & Business Processes segment, which includes the Office and Dynamics CRM businesses, contributed 43.2% to total revenues. Revenues increased 12% (up 13% at cc) on a year-over-year basis to $28.3 billion, ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected results across all businesses.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services revenues rose 13% (up 14% in cc). M365 commercial cloud revenues increased 15% (up 16% in cc) with business trends that were as expected. The better-than-expected result was due to a small benefit from an in-period revenue recognition.\n\nARPU growth was primarily driven by E5 as well as M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 8% year over year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was driven by small and medium business and frontline worker offerings.\n\nMicrosoft 365 commercial cloud revenues represent nearly 90% of total M365 commercial products and cloud services.\n\nMicrosoft 365 commercial products revenues increased 2% (up 3% in cc), ahead of expectations, primarily due to the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier.\n\nM365 consumer products and cloud services revenues grew 5% (up 6% in cc). M365 consumer cloud revenues increased 6% (up 7% in cc) with continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to 84.4 million. M365 consumer cloud revenues represent 85% of total M365 consumer products and cloud services.\n\nLinkedIn revenues rose 10% (up 9% in cc), slightly ahead of expectations, with growth across all lines of business.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11% (up 12% in cc) and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year over year due to scaling the company\u2019s AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2% and operating income increased 16%.\n\nThe Intelligent Cloud segment, including server and enterprise products and services, contributed 36.7% to total revenues. The segment reported revenues of $24.1 billion, which increased 20% year over year (up 21% at cc).\n\nServer products and cloud services revenues jumped 23%, driven by Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 33% (up 34% in cc), with healthy consumption trends that were in line with expectations. The better-than-expected result was due to the small benefit from an in-period revenue recognition.\n\nAzure growth included roughly 12 points from AI services, similar to the last quarter. Demand continues to be higher than the company\u2019s available capacity. Non-AI growth trends were also in line with expectations in total and across regions as customers continued to migrate and modernize on the Azure platform. The non-AI point contribution to Azure growth was sequentially lower by approximately 1 point.\n\nIn the on-premises server business, revenues decreased 1%. Lower-than-expected transactional purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2025 launch, as well as lower purchasing of licenses running in multi-cloud environments, was mostly offset by the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier.\n\nEnterprise and partner services revenues decreased 1% and were relatively unchanged in constant currency.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 15% and gross margin percentage decreased 3 points year over year, driven by scaling the company\u2019s infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 8% and operating income grew 18%.\n\nMore Personal Computing segment, which primarily comprises Windows, Gaming, Devices and Search businesses, contributed 20.1% to total revenues. Revenues increased 15% year over year to $13.18 billion. The growth included 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations driven by Gaming and Search.\n\nWindows OEM and Devices revenues increased 2% year over year as better-than-expected results in Windows OEM due to a mix shift to higher monetizing markets were partially offset by the lower-than-expected results in Devices due to execution challenges in the commercial segment.\n\nSearch and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 18% (up 19% in cc), ahead of expectations, primarily due to continued execution improvement. The company saw rate expansion in addition to healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing.\n\nIn Gaming, revenues increased 43% (up 44% in cc), with 43 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations driven by stronger-than-expected performance in both first- and third-party content as well as consoles. Xbox content and services revenues rose 61% with 53 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% in constant currency, with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year over year. Strong execution on margin improvement in Gaming and Search was offset by a sales mix shift to those businesses.\n\nAt a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of more than 3 points to revenue growth, which was a 2-point drag on operating income growth, and had a negative 5-cent impact on earnings per share. This net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from Microsoft\u2019s prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party and includes $911 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs.\n\nOperating expenses increased 49% with 51 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income decreased 4%.\nStory Continues\nAzure Boosts Microsoft's Fiscal Q1 Financials\nAzure Arc now has more than 39,000 customers across every industry, including American Tower, CTT and L\u2019Oreal, up more than 80% year over year.\n\nMicrosoft now has data centers in more than 60 regions around the world. In fiscal first quarter, MSFT announced new cloud and AI infrastructure investments in Brazil, Italy, Mexico and Sweden, as the company expanded capacity in line with long-term demand signals.\n\nAt the silicon layer, new Cobalt 100 VMs are being used by companies like Databricks, Elastic, Siemens, Snowflake and Synopsys to power their general-purpose workloads at up to 50% better price performance than previous generations.\n\nOn top of this, Microsoft is building out the next generation AI infrastructure, innovating across the full stack to optimize its fleet for AI workloads. MSFT is offering the broadest selection of AI accelerators, including the first-party accelerator Maia 100, as well as the latest GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA.\n\nMicrosoft has become the first cloud provider to bring up NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI also continues to deliver results. It has built a differentiated IP and is driving revenue momentum. More broadly, with Azure AI, the company is building an end-to-end app platform to help customers build their own copilots and agents.\n\nAzure OpenAI usage has more than doubled over the past six months, as both digital natives like Grammarly and Harvey, as well as established enterprises like Bajaj Finance, Hitachi, KT, and LG, move apps from test to production.\nGE Aerospace, for example, used Azure OpenAI to build a new digital assistant for all 52,000 of its employees. In just three months, it has been used to conduct over 500,000 internal queries and process more than 200,000 documents.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Microsoft added support for OpenAI\u2019s newest model family o1. MSFT is also bringing industry-specific models to Azure AI, including a collection of best-in-class multimodal models for medical imaging.\n\nWith GitHub Models, Microsoft now provides access to the full model catalog directly within the GitHub developer workflow.\n\nAs developers build new AI apps on Azure, Microsoft has seen an acceleration of Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL DB Hyperscale usage, as customers like Air India, Novo Nordisk, Telefonica, Toyota Motor North America and Uniper take advantage of capabilities purpose-built for AI applications.\n\nWith Microsoft Fabric, Microsoft provides a single AI-powered platform to help customers like Chanel, EY, KPMG, Swiss Air, and Syndigo unify their data across clouds. The company now has over 16,000 paid Fabric customers, including over 70% of the Fortune 500.\nMicrosoft's AI Copilot Adoption Surges in Q1\nGitHub Copilot is bending the productivity curve for developers. In the quarter, Copilot Enterprise customers increased 55% quarter over quarter as companies like AMD and Flutter Entertainment tailor Copilot to their codebase.\n\nMicrosoft is introducing the next phase of AI code generation, making GitHub Copilot agentic across the developer workflow. GitHub Copilot Workspace is a developer environment that leverages agents from start to finish, so developers can go from spec, to plan, to code, all in natural language.\n\nCopilot Autofix is an AI agent that helps developers at companies like Asurion and Otto Group fix vulnerabilities in their code over three times faster than it would take them on their own.\n\nMicrosoft is also continuing to build on GitHub\u2019s open platform ethos by making more models available via GitHub Copilot.\n\nThe company is expanding the reach of GitHub to a new segment of developers, introducing GitHub Spark, which enables anyone to build apps in natural language.\n\nMicrosoft has brought generative AI to Power Platform to help customers use the low-code/no-code tools to cut costs and development time. To date, nearly 600,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 4X year over year.\n\nCitizen developers at ZF, for example, build apps simply by describing what they need using natural language.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Microsoft introduced new ways for customers to apply AI to streamline complex workflows with Power Automate.\n\nMicrosoft also launched the next wave of Microsoft 365 Copilot innovation last month, bringing together web, work, and Pages as a new design system for knowledge work. Pages is the first new digital artifact for the AI age, and it is designed to help you ideate with AI and collaborate with other people. The company has also made Microsoft 365 Copilot responses 2X faster and improved response quality by nearly 3X. This innovation is driving accelerated usage and the number of people who use Microsoft 365 Copilot daily more than doubled quarter over quarter.\n\nThe company is witnessing increased adoption from customers in every industry as it uses Microsoft 365 Copilot to drive real business value. Vodafone, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 68,000 employees after a trial showed that on average it saved three hours per person per week. UBS will deploy 50,000 seats in Microsoft\u2019s largest FinServ deal to date.\n\nMicrosoft continues to see enterprise customers coming back to buy more seats. All-up, nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, and customers continue to adopt it at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite.\n\nCopilot is the UI for AI, and with Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents and now autonomous agents MSFT has built an end-to-end system for AI business transformation. With Copilot Studio, organizations can build and connect Microsoft 365 Copilot to autonomous agents, which are then delegated to Copilot when there is an exception.\n\nMore than 100,000 organizations, from Nsure, Standard Bank and Thomson Reuters, to Virgin Money and Zurich Insurance have used Copilot Studio to date, up over 2X quarter over quarter.\n\nMore broadly, Microsoft is seeing AI drive a fundamental change in the business applications market, as customers shift from legacy apps to AI-first business process. Dynamics 365 continues to take share as organizations like Everon, HEINEKEN, and Lexmark choose the apps over other providers.\n\nMonthly active users of Copilot across CRM and ERP portfolios increased more than 60% quarter over quarter.\n\nDynamics 365 Contact Center is also winning customers like Currys, Le Creuset and RXO, as it brings generative AI to every customer engagement channel.\n\nMicrosoft is also bringing AI to industry-specific workflows. One year in, DAX Copilot is now documenting over 1.3 million physician-patient encounters each month at more than 500 healthcare organizations like Baptist Medical Group, Baylor Scott & White, Greater Baltimore Medical Center, Novant Health and Overlake Medical Center.\n\nMicrosoft Teams usage remains at all-time highs as people use it to streamline all their communications. Nearly 75% of Teams Enterprise customers now buy Premium, Phone, or Rooms.\n\nThe new class of Copilot+ PCs is winning new customers. AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm now all support Copilot+ PCs.\nOperating Results\nGross profit increased 13.1% year over year to $45.48 billion. The gross margin contracted 180 basis points (bps) to 69.4% on a year-over-year basis due to the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin, as well as the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud\u2019s gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year over year to 71%. This was slightly better than expected due to improvement in Azure, although the gross margin percentage decreased year over year and continues to be driven by scaling MSFT\u2019s AI infrastructure.\n\nOperating expenses rose 12.1% year over year to $14.9 billion, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies and ongoing prioritization work. Operating expense growth included 9 points from the Activision acquisition.\n\nOperating income increased 14% and operating margins were 47%, down 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the net impact from the Activision acquisition, operating margins were up 1 point as Microsoft continued to drive efficiencies across businesses driven by investment in AI infrastructure and capabilities.\n\nProductivity & Business Process operating income rose 15.5% to $16.51 billion. Intelligent Cloud operating income increased 17.9% to $10.5 billion. More Personal Computing\u2019s operating income decreased 4.3% to $3.53 billion.\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, Microsoft had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $78.42 billion compared with $75.54 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, long-term debt (including the current portion) was $42.86 billion compared with $44.9 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\nCash flow from operations was $34.2 billion, up 12%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier, employee, and tax payments. Free cash flow was $19.3 billion, down 7% year over year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings.\n\nMicrosoft returned $9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nGuidance\nFor the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft expects the cost of revenues between $21.9 billion and $22.1 billion and operating expenses to grow in the $16.4-$16.5 billion range. Other income and expenses are expected to be roughly $(1.5) billion.\n\nThe company expects revenue growth in the productivity and business processes segment between $28.7 billion and $29 billion.\n\nMSFT expects Office 365 Commercial revenue growth to be roughly 14% at cc. Office Commercial products revenues are expected to decline in the low-single digit.\n\nIn Office Consumer products and cloud services, Microsoft expects revenue growth in mid-single digits. For LinkedIn, the company expects revenue growth to be nearly 10%. In Dynamics, MSFT expects revenue growth in the mid-to-high teens.\n\nFor Intelligent Cloud, Microsoft anticipates revenues between $25.55 billion and $25.85 billion.\n\nIn Azure, MSFT expects revenue growth at cc between 31% and 32%. In Enterprise Services, revenues are expected to grow in low-single digits. The company expects Server product revenues to decline in the low-to-mid single digits.\n\nFor More Personal Computing, the company projects revenues between $13.85 billion and $14.25 billion. It expects Windows OEM revenues to grow in low-to-mid single digits.\n\nIn Gaming, Microsoft expects revenues to decline in high-single digit.\n\nMicrosoft expects Xbox content and services revenue growth to remain relatively flat year over year.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.\nVGM Scores\nCurrently, Microsoft has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Microsoft stock (MSFT) lagged its Big Tech peers on Friday after news broke late Wednesday that the Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust probe into the tech giant.\nAfter falling as much as 0.8% on Friday, Microsoft shares finished the session up 0.1%. The Nasdaq rose 0.8% on the day while the S&P 500 gained 0.6% to close at a record high.\nBut at least one Wall Street analyst sees the news coming as no surprise and expects changes at the FTC under the Trump administration to make antitrust worries in the tech space fade away.\n\"In our view as the dark days for tech with Lina [Khan] at the FTC appear numbered now with a Trump White House, it is not a complete shocker that Wednesday after the bell the FTC announced a broad sweeping investigation into Microsoft as a final shot across the bow at Big Tech from Kahn before she departs,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nIves added this probe \"is much more bark than bite\" and will become a secondary concern for the company once President-elect Donald Trump names a new FTC leader.\n\u2022 USD\n(MSFT)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nAccording to Bloomberg, which broke the story, the FTC's request to Microsoft is \"hundreds of pages long\" and focuses, among other things, on how the company bundles its cloud services with other software, like its productivity suite (Word, Outlook, Excel) and security offerings.\nCurrent FTC Chair Lina Khan has aggressively pursued antitrust actions against tech giants, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and now Microsoft.\nThe stocks of Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all trailing the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 26% year-to-date gain.\nAlphabet is currently facing the most serious threat, with a federal judge finding earlier this year that the company's Google search engine was run as an illegal monopoly. Earlier this month, the DOJ asked the company to sell its Chrome browser and divest its Android mobile operating system.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) chair Lina Khan testifies before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on May 15, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) \u00b7 Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\nFollowing Trump's election win, investor optimism grew that these various antitrust threats would disappear under his administration. Some legal experts, however, are less confident, as Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reported.\nIves, for his part, sees the recent era in which regulators sought to limit Big Tech deals and scrutinize the world's largest companies as one that is coming to an end.\n\"We believe there will be major shifts in policy against Big Tech over the coming years with Trump in the White House and Khan out at the FTC ... we believe [it is] just a matter of time and will remove a huge thorn in the side of the tech world,\" Ives wrote.\nStory Continues\n\"As someone that has covered tech throughout the Microsoft vs. US Government trial/soap opera for many years in the 1990's into an ultimate win for Redmond, we believe negotiations and remedies will be much smaller than the fears for Google, Apple, MSFT, Meta and Big Tech.\"\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Microsoft (MSFT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 2.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.14 per share, indicating a change of +7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.9% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $12.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.6%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.78 indicates a change of +14.3% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $68.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $277.69 billion and $315.51 billion estimates indicate +13.3% and +13.6% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $65.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16%. EPS of $3.30 for the same period compares with $2.99 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.82%. The EPS surprise was +7.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months.\nOn November 25, the stock market saw a significant surge, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping 440 points to a new record close of 44,736.57. The S&P 500 also reached a new high, gaining 0.3% to 5,987.37, while the Russell 2000 index, which focuses on small-cap stocks, hit an all-time high, increasing 1.47% to 2,442.03. The Nasdaq also rose, closing 0.27% higher at 19,054.84. CNBC reported that the market\u2019s strong performance was attributed to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Scott Bessent, the founder of Key Square Group, as Treasury secretary. Investors are optimistic that Bessent, a hedge fund manager, will be supportive of the equity market and help mitigate some of Trump\u2019s protectionist policies, such as his stance on tariffs.\nUS Stocks Poised for Continued Growth\nIn an interview with CNBC on November 25, Brian Belski, Chief Investment Officer at BMO Capital Markets, expressed his bullish stance on the US stock market, stating that it remains the best asset in the world. He emphasized that despite the negativity and doubts surrounding the market, his team has consistently maintained a bullish stance since 2009.\nBelski pointed out that many investors are too focused on valuation, which he believes is the world\u2019s worst metric for predicting forward performance. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of earnings growth consistency, where the US is expected to outperform other regions.\nHe also highlighted the potential for catch-up growth in the financial sector, particularly in the areas of scale, asset managers, and discretionary spending. His team\u2019s research suggests that earnings in the US financial sector are massively understated, and he expects a big catch-up trade on the earnings front.\nRegarding valuation, Belski dismissed the idea of assigning a specific valuation metric, such as a P/E ratio, as simplistic. Instead, his team uses a macro P/E longer-term trend and a dividend discount model to evaluate the market. He believes the S&P 500 can reach 6,700, driven by US growth and earnings consistency.\nBrian Belski has been bullish on small-cap stocks for well over a year and believes small-cap stocks are a good value play. He also implies that small-cap stocks are undervalued, citing various valuation metrics such as price-to-sales, and price-to-book, as well as operating metrics such as return on assets and return on equity. He suggests that these metrics indicate that small-cap stocks are a good value investment opportunity.\nStory Continues\nThe US stock market continues to show resilience and strength, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 reaching new highs. The nomination of Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary has injected a sense of optimism into the market. With the market\u2019s strong performance and positive outlook, investors are well-positioned to take advantage of the current trend. With that in context, let\u2019s take a look at the top 8 stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the top 8 stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s database to research stocks in 8 different sectors. We picked stocks from different sectors that were the most popular among elite money managers. The final list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nWhy Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is the Top Stock to Buy in 8 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months?\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nSector: Technology\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a global technology giant offering software, cloud computing, hardware, and services. The company\u2019s key products include Windows, Office, Azure cloud platform, and LinkedIn. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) benefits from the growing adoption of cloud solutions and artificial intelligence and is heavily investing in its flagship products to dominate their respective markets.\nOn October 30, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported its Q1 2025 financial results for the period ending September 30. The company achieved 16% year-over-year revenue growth, reaching $65.6 billion. Cloud revenue increased by 22% year-over-year, with Azure\u2019s revenue soaring 33%, driven by high-value contracts and the growing adoption of AI-powered services.\nAzure continues to be a key growth driver for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), with Azure Arc adoption rising by over 80% year-over-year, exceeding 39,000 customers across industries such as telecommunications, consumer goods, and finance. During the quarter, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) expanded its data center capacity with new investments in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and Sweden to meet the increasing demand for cloud and AI services. The company\u2019s data center infrastructure now spans more than 60 regions globally.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also introduced Cobalt 100 VMs, which offer up to 50% improved performance for general-purpose workloads. Additionally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is developing an end-to-end AI application platform with Azure AI to enable customers to create custom copilots and agents.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of top stocks to buy in 8 different sectors for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include including Oracle ORCL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nIs Oracle a Buy, Sell or Hold at a P/S Multiple of 8.61x?\nWhile Oracle \u00a0has been a standout performer with a 52.9% gain over the past six-month period, significantly outpacing both the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and S&P 500's modest growth of 8.1% and 13.1%, respectively, this impressive run-up has pushed valuations to a concerning level.\nTrading at an elevated price-to-sales multiple of 8.61X compared with the Zacks Computer-Software industry\u2019s 8.02X, the stock appears to have gotten ahead of its fundamental growth prospects.\nThe enterprise software giant's rich valuation metrics suggest investors are pricing in overly optimistic growth expectations, despite mounting challenges in the competitive cloud computing landscape. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and creates substantial downside risk for current shareholders.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.02 billion, suggesting 9.55% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $6.20 per share, indicating an increase of 11.51% year over year. These growth rates hardly justify the current rich valuation. The marginal 0.2% increase in earnings estimates over the past 60 days suggests limited upside potential from current levels.\nFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nCloud Growth: Concerning Deceleration\nDespite management's optimistic tone about cloud performance, with total cloud revenues up 22% to $5.6 billion, concerning patterns emerge. The Infrastructure-as-a-Service revenue growth of 46% represents a significant deceleration from the 64% growth reported last year. This slowdown raises questions about Oracle's ability to maintain momentum in the highly competitive cloud market, especially against established leaders.\nCapital Intensity Raises Red Flags\nThe company's announcement of doubling fiscal 2025 CapEx compared to 2024 is particularly concerning. With first-quarter CapEx already at $2.3 billion and plans for massive data center expansions, including facilities exceeding a gigawatt, Oracle is betting heavily on infrastructure buildout. This aggressive spending could pressure margins and free cash flow, especially if cloud adoption rates don't meet expectations.\nStory Continues\nMulti-Cloud Strategy Creates Hidden Risks\nWhile Oracle touts its new partnership with Amazon -owned Amazon Web Services, joining existing relationships with Microsoft Azure and Alphabet -owned Google Cloud, this multi-cloud approach might signal weakness. The strategy could be interpreted as an admission that Oracle's cloud infrastructure isn't winning enough standalone business, forcing the company to piggyback on more successful platforms.\nFinancial Performance Concerns\nThough the first quarter showed some positive metrics, including operating income growth of 14% and an operating margin of 43%, the company's reliance on accounting changes to boost results is troubling. The extension of estimated server lives from five to six years reduced first-quarter operating expenses by $197 million, artificially inflating profitability metrics.\nDebt and Cash Flow Considerations\nWith only $11 billion in cash and marketable securities, Oracle's aggressive capital expenditure plans could strain its balance sheet. While operating cash flow for the first quarter was $7.4 billion, the intensive capital requirements for data center expansion could significantly impact free cash flow going forward.\nRisk Factors to Monitor\nKey risks include potential further deceleration in cloud growth rates, margin pressure from aggressive infrastructure investments and execution risks in the multi-cloud strategy. The company's heavy capital expenditure plans could also pressure financial flexibility if cloud adoption rates don't meet expectations.\nWhile Oracle's strategic initiatives show promise, the current valuation of 8.61X sales appears unsustainable given the company's actual growth rates and capital requirements. Investors would be better served waiting for a more attractive entry point, ideally when the P/S multiple approaches a more reasonable level that better reflects the company's growth profile and competitive challenges in the cloud market.\nConclusion\nGiven Oracle's rich valuation multiple, decelerating growth rates in key segments, and massive capital expenditure commitments, investors should consider reducing positions or exiting entirely. The current price level appears to price in an overly optimistic scenario while ignoring significant risks and capital requirements. Oracle currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive \u201ccritical shock\u201d for the country\u2019s fiscal health.\nREAD NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings\nThe Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years.\n\u201cThe use of AI presents the rare \u2014 possibly unique \u2014 opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system\u201d.\nWhile adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists\u2019 outlook on AI and healthcare is \u201ca mix of enthusiasm and despair\u201d.\n\u201cEnthusiasm because there\u2019s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. \u2026 But there\u2019s friction due to regulation, due to incentives \u2014 because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things \u2014 and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities\u201d.\nIn other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in cloud-delivered endpoint and cloud workload protection. On November 27, Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari raised the firm\u2019s price target on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD to $390 from $375 and kept an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on the shares. According to Baird, Crowdstrike has delivered a strong Q3 powered by its growth of Falcon Flex, the company\u2019s definitive AI-native cybersecurity platform. However, some challenges were also highlighted such as extended sales cycles and temporary volatility in ARR/FCF momentum.\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, CrowdStrike Holdings fair value estimate is US$335\nCrowdStrike Holdings' US$348 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\nAnalyst price target for CRWD is US$370, which is 10% above our fair value estimate\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nThe Model\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$1.06b\nUS$1.38b\nUS$1.78b\nUS$2.05b\nUS$2.99b\nUS$3.54b\nUS$4.02b\nUS$4.43b\nUS$4.78b\nUS$5.09b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x28\nAnalyst x30\nAnalyst x21\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 18.26%\nEst @ 13.56%\nEst @ 10.28%\nEst @ 7.98%\nEst @ 6.37%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%\nUS$989\nUS$1.2k\nUS$1.5k\nUS$1.6k\nUS$2.1k\nUS$2.4k\nUS$2.5k\nUS$2.6k\nUS$2.6k\nUS$2.6k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20b\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$5.1b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$122b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$122b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$62b\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$82b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$348, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Discounted Cash Flow November 29th 2024\nThe Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CrowdStrike Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.041. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nExpensive based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nLooking Ahead:\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Analysts were expecting 87 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates.\nShares of CrowdStrike had fallen 5.9% at 1:33 p.m. in New York on Wednesday.\nThe report is the company\u2019s second since a flawed CrowdStrike update crashed millions of devices operating on Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Windows systems. The outage, which unfolded on July 19, disrupted a wide range of industries, including air travel, banks and health care. The company posted sales three months ago that beat expectations, a sign that investors took to mean the global IT outage wouldn\u2019t significantly affect its finances.\nThird-quarter revenue represented a bright spot in Tuesday\u2019s report. Sales for the period came to $1.01 billion, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Profit, excluding some items, was 93 cents a share, compared with the average estimate of 81 cents.\nCrowdStrike also raised its guidance for revenue for the full fiscal year, to $3.92 billion to $3.93 billion. Analysts were expecting $3.9 billion.\nThe company surpassed $4 billion in annual recurring revenue as of Oct. 31, making CrowdStrike \u201cthe fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone,\u201d Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said in the statement.\nThe company excluded roughly $26 million from its annual recurring revenue in the quarter, CrowdStrike Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere said during the earnings call. That came after a distributor in the federal space provided notice of its intention \u201cto exercise transferability rights with respect to a transaction,\u201d and CrowdStrike concluded the transaction wouldn\u2019t recur. That transaction remains in revenue in compliance with US revenue recognition rules, Podbere said.\nCrowdStrike previously agreed to a $32 million deal with Carahsoft Technology Corp., a distributor which serves as a middleman between technology companies and government agencies, for identity protection software intended for the US Internal Revenue Service. But the IRS never purchased the software, Bloomberg reported in October.\nStory Continues\nThe deal caused concern within CrowdStrike and, according to some legal and accounting experts, raised red flags.\nJeremy Fielding, a spokesperson for CrowdStrike, declined to say whether the company\u2019s comments were related to the Carahsoft deal involving the IRS. \u201cOur comments during the Q3 FY 25 earnings call speak for themselves,\u201d he said in an email. Carahsoft didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nDelta Airlines\u2019 operations were stunted for days as a result of the outage, costing the airline at least $500 million in out-of-pocket losses, according to a lawsuit it filed against CrowdStrike in October. CrowdStrike said Delta was shifting blame \u201cfrom its failure to update its antiquated IT infrastructure,\u201d in a statement at the time.\n\u201cFollowing this summer\u2019s incident as a company we were tested,\u201d Kurtz said, in a call with investors on Tuesday. \u201cWe responded with speed, care and resolve and we focused on becoming even better.\u201d\n(Updates shares in third paragraph and with additional information in 10th and 11th paragraph.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Sees Strong Module Adoption, Valuation Concerns Persist: Analysts\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock is trading lower Wednesday after the company reported third-quarter financial results.\nOn Tuesday, CrowdStrike reported third-quarter revenue of $1.01 billion, up 29%, beating the\u00a0consensus estimate of $982.36 million.\u00a0The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, beating analyst estimates of $0.81. Annual recurring revenue increased 27% to $4.02 billion.\nAlso Read: Microsoft\u2019s Brad Smith Urges Trump Government to Tackle Growing Cyber Threats\nCrowdStrike expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.029 billion\u2014$1.035 billion, versus estimates of $1.03 billion. The company anticipates fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.84\u2014$0.86 versus estimates of $0.86.\nCrowdStrike now expects full-year revenue of $3.924 billion\u2014$3.931 billion, compared to estimates of $3.897 billion. The company also expects full-year EPS of $3.74\u2014$3.76, compared to estimates of $3.63.\nAnalysts rerated the stock after the quarterly print.\nWestPark Capital analyst Paul Rodriguez reiterated CrowdStrike with a Hold.\nNeedham analyst Mike Cikos maintained CrowdStrike with a Buy and raised the price target from\u00a0$360\u00a0to\u00a0$420.\nWestPark Capital: Based on the upbeat quarterly print and guidance boost, Rodriguez increased their full-year estimates to $3.93 billion in revenue and $3.76 in EPS, up from prior projections of $3.89 billion and $3.62.\nThe adoption rate of CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity modules continues to outpace its overall revenue growth of 28.5% in the third quarter. Customers using five or more modules are driving this momentum, suggesting that spending on additional modules could sustain growth above 28% for longer than anticipated. Integrating Next-Gen SIEM and artificial intelligence tools like Charlotte AI further supports this trend, fueling customer interest and module adoption.\nWhile the quarter\u2019s overall performance was robust, CrowdStrike\u2019s net new ARR declined compared to the second quarter, dropping to $217 million. The company attributed this to the July security incident and a slowdown in new customer acquisitions. Despite this, management expressed confidence in regaining growth in net new ARR as fiscal 2026 approaches.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s valuation continues to trade at a significant premium relative to its peers. The company\u2019s calendar year 2025 price-to-sales (P/S) multiple stands at 19.7x, compared to the peer average of 10.5x. Similarly, its enterprise value-to-sales (EV/Sales) multiple of 22.4x far exceeds the peer group\u2019s 9.3x. Analysts at WestPark reiterated a \u201cHold\u201d rating, citing these valuation disparities. Rodriguez expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.034 billion and EPS of $0.85.\nStory Continues\nNeedham:\u00a0CrowdStrike exceeded all guided metrics in its third quarter of fiscal year 2025, demonstrating solid execution despite industry challenges. Gross retention, which declined less than 0.5% quarter-over-quarter, highlights the company\u2019s resilience and supports management\u2019s approach to leveraging opportunities amid crises. A $500 million quarter-over-quarter increase in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reflects a surge in multi-year contracts. CrowdStrike consolidates customers onto its Falcon platform and strengthens retention through multi-module adoption, making replacements more difficult.\nManagement acknowledges reduced visibility heading into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, emphasizing headwinds in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and subscription growth. However, the company remains confident about ARR reacceleration in the second half of fiscal 2026.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon Flex offering has gained significant traction, with its total contract value (TCV) nearly doubling quarter-over-quarter to $1.3 billion, up from $700 million in the prior quarter. Flex customers, often strategic partners, spend millions of dollars with CrowdStrike, far exceeding the spending of the average customer.\nThe company\u2019s Next-Gen SIEM product continues to grow rapidly, with ARR increasing over 150% year-over-year, nearing $300 million. Adoption by over 2,000 customers underscores its appeal, with each paying approximately $150,000 annually.\nCikos raised the price target, applying a 21.3x EV/Sales multiple to fiscal 2026 revenue estimates. The updated valuation reflects increased confidence in CrowdStrike\u2019s ability to execute its customer commitment strategy and outperform its target operating model. The previous price target of $360 was based on an 18.3x EV/Sales multiple.\nCrowdStrike is poised for further growth as it continues to capitalize on multi-module adoption and innovative offerings like Falcon Flex and Next-Gen SIEM. Management\u2019s focus on ARR recovery and cost optimization positions the company for improved visibility and performance exiting fiscal 2025.\nCikos expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.034 billion and EPS of $0.86. He projects fiscal 2025 revenue of $3.901 billion and EPS of $3.62.\nPrice Action: CRWD stock is down 6.28% at $341.42 at last check Wednesday.\nAlso Read:\nMeta, OpenAI, Orange Join Forces To Build AI Models For African Languages\nPhoto via Shutterstock.\nLatest Ratings for CRWD\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nBarclays\nMaintains\nOverweight\nMar 2022\nCanaccord Genuity\nMaintains\nBuy\nMar 2022\nDeutsche Bank\nMaintains\nBuy\nView More Analyst Ratings for CRWD\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

The quarter itself was solid as CRWD beat across most of the key operating metrics we track, including billings, revenue, operating profit, and earnings.\nHowever, the quarter wasn't perfect as the company provided earnings guidance for the next quarter which fell below expectations, while revenue guidance was roughly in line.\nAdditionally, there was an unusual update during the earnings call: the removal of $26 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) from a transaction with a distributor in the Federal vertical, which is not expected to recur.\nFurthermore, management's comments during the earnings call suggest net new ARR growth is not expected to accelerate until the second half of fiscal 2026, potentially dampening near-term expectations.\nGiven the strong momentum leading up to the earnings report, the market may have been expecting a more convincing \"beat and raise\" quarter.\nThe shares closed the day at $347.71, down 4.6% from previous close.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.

In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 25.2% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit.\nKeeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.\nLastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending earlier when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results. These results could signal a shift in sentiment given CrowdStrike's popularity within the cyber security space, especially considering its cloud security capabilities.\nStory Continues\nCrowdStrike is up 40.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $347.65 per share, it is still trading 11.3% below its 52-week high of $392.15 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $6,176.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive \u201ccritical shock\u201d for the country\u2019s fiscal health.\nREAD NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings\nThe Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years.\n\u201cThe use of AI presents the rare \u2014 possibly unique \u2014 opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system\u201d.\nWhile adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists\u2019 outlook on AI and healthcare is \u201ca mix of enthusiasm and despair\u201d.\n\u201cEnthusiasm because there\u2019s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. \u2026 But there\u2019s friction due to regulation, due to incentives \u2014 because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things \u2014 and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities\u201d.\nIn other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Broadcom Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $14.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +51.3%. The $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +44% and +16.7%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Rich Valera.\nRichard Valera\nGood afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call to discuss first quarter fiscal year 2025 financial results. Joining me today are Rajiv Ramaswami, Nutanix's President and CEO; and Rukmini Sivaraman, Nutanix's CFO. After the market closed today, Nutanix issued a press release announcing first quarter fiscal year 2025 results. If you'd like to read the release, please visit the press releases section of our IR website.\nDuring today's call, management will make forward-looking statements, including financial guidance. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated by these statements. For a more detailed description of these and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K as well as our earnings press release issued today.\nThese forward-looking statements apply as of today, and we undertake no obligation to revise these statements after this call. As a result, you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Please note, unless otherwise specifically referenced, all financial measures we use on today's call, except for revenue, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided, to the extent available, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures on our IR website and in our earnings press release.\nNutanix is participating in the Raymond James TMT and Consumer Conference in New York on December 10 and the Barclays Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on December 12. We hope to see some of you at these events. Finally, our second quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period will begin on January 18.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nStory Continues\nRajiv Ramaswami\nThank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We are happy to report first-quarter results that came in ahead of our guidance. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership, our TCO.\nTaking a closer look at the first quarter, we exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $591 million. We grew our ARR 18% year over year to $1.966 billion. We also saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in new logos and solid free cash flow generation.\nOur largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to organizations that are looking to modernize their IT footprint, including adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models and modern applications while also managing through disruption from industry M&A.\nOne of our largest wins of the quarter was a full stack expansion with a global provider of IT consulting services based in the APAC region. This existing Nutanix customer expanded with us by shifting more workloads to our cloud platform, and adding additional components of our portfolio, enabling them to increase their automation and self-service capabilities while also reducing their exposure to their other incumbent infrastructure provider. This expansion was also aimed at strengthening their go-to-market practice with Nutanix in the areas of generating AI, modern applications, and competitive migrations.\nAnother notable win in Q1 was a significant expansion with a North American-based Fortune 100 provider of food services and products. This customer was looking to implement a hybrid multi-cloud environment with the intent of running more of their workloads in the public cloud and lowering their total cost of ownership while also reducing their exposure to our largest competitor. They chose the Nutanix Cloud platform, including our Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2, running on AWS, along with Nutanix Cloud Management. This enables them to reduce their projected TCO by nearly 50%, while also consolidating their existing data center footprint.\nOn the product front, we recently announced the general availability of GPT-in-a-Box 2.0, our solution for simplifying the deployment of generative AI applications. A key component of this offering is Nutanix Enterprise AI, or NAI, which helps streamline deployment scaling and running of influencing end points for large language models. NAI can be deployed within GPT-in-a-Box on-prem or at the edge or independently, on native public cloud services, such as AWS, EKS, and Azure AKF. These new capabilities help further our vision of becoming the leading platform for running all apps and managing data anywhere.\nA first-quarter new logo with the government ministry in the EMEA region demonstrated early progress with the new generative AI and modern application capabilities of our platform. This customer was looking to modernize their infrastructure and chose a full stack Nutanix solution to support development and deployment of their cloud-native and generative AI applications. They chose our GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution including our Nutanix Kubernetes Platform and Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure, as well as our Nutanix Unified storage and Nutanix Database Service offerings.\nMoving on, we also continue to make progress on the partnership front, signing an expanded strategic partnership with AWS that will simplify cloud migrations and offer access to AWS services for customers looking to migrate to NC2 on AWS. As part of this collaboration, customers will gain access to promotional credits from AWS to support customer migrations and proof-of-concept trials as well as Nutanix licensing promotions. Customers can also gain access to promotional credits for migrating VMware cloud and AWS workloads to NC2 on AWS through the AWS VMware migration accelerator program.\nFinally, we continue to receive industry recognition in Q1, being named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for distributed hybrid infrastructure, alongside some of the leading public cloud providers, improving from our challenged position in the 2023 Magic Quadrant.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our solid first-quarter results. Our ongoing innovation on our cloud platform, particularly with respect to its support for generative AI and modern applications and on the progress we continue to make on partnerships. We remain focused while driving sustainable, profitable growth.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Rajiv, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will first discuss our Q1 fiscal '25 results, followed by our guidance for Q2 fiscal '25 and an updated outlook for the full fiscal year 2025.\nResults in Q1 '25 came in above the high end of our range across our guided metrics. Revenue in Q1 was $591 million, higher than the guided range of $565 million to $575 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 16%. The outperformance in revenue was driven by good renewals execution. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.966 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%.\nWe saw strength in landing new customers onto our platform, helped by more leverage from our OEM and channel partners from the various programs we have put in place to incentivize new logos and from a general increase in engagement from customers looking at us as an alternative in the wake of industry M&A.\nNRR, or net dollar-based retention rate at the end of Q1 was 110%. Expansion with existing customers was impacted largely by our US federal business for which Q1 is a seasonally strong quarter given their September 30 fiscal year-end. Our US Fed business performance was lower year over year relative to the strong comparison from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to impacts from the elongated continuing resolution resulting in lighter spending from our Fed customers.\nBased on our current view, we expect our US federal business performance to return to more normal levels in the second quarter. In Q1, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels, which we believe is influenced by the macroeconomic environment and continued increased scrutiny on spend. In addition, as discussed during prior earnings calls, we believe the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure.\nThese factors also impact our ARR growth. Average contract duration in Q1 was to 3.1 years flat sequentially quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 87.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 20%, higher than our guided range of 14.5% to 15.5%, largely due to higher revenue and to a smaller extent, due to lower expenses including as a result of certain nonrecurring payments and credits.\nNon-GAAP net income in Q1 was $122 million, of fully diluted EPS of $0.42 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares. GAAP net income and fully diluted GAAP EPS in Q1 were $30 million and $0.10 per share, respectively. Free cash flow in Q1 was $152 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 26%.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalence and short-term investments of $1.075 billion up from $994 million at the end of Q4.\nMoving to capital allocation. We repurchased about $20 million worth of shares in Q1 and used about $79 million of cash in Q1 to retire shares related to our employees' STAC liability for their quarterly RSU vesting.\nMoving to Q2 '25. Our guidance for Q2 is as follows: revenue of $635 million to $645 million; non-GAAP operating margin of 20% to 21%; fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares.\nMoving to the full year. The updated guidance for fiscal year '25 is as follows: revenue of $2.435 billion to $2.465 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 14% at third point and no change from our initial guidance. The non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 16% to 17%, an increase from our previous guidance. Free cash flow of $560 million to $610 million, representing a free cash flow margin of approximately 24% at the midpoint and an increase of $15 million relative to our prior initial guidance at the midpoint.\nI will now provide some commentary and assumptions regarding our updated fiscal year '25 guidance. First, we are seeing continued land-and-expand opportunities and a growing pipeline for our solutions. However, as we have discussed previously, we expect continued uncertainty in the timing, outcome and deal structure from the growing mix of larger deals in the pipeline. And as I mentioned earlier, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels, which we believe is related to the uncertain spending environment and which we expect to continue.\nSecond, the guidance assumes that renewals will continue to perform well in fiscal year '25. Third, the full-year guidance assumes that average contract duration will be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '24 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings.\nFourth, the non-GAAP operating margin guidance assumes incremental prudent investments in sales and marketing and research and development, targeted towards addressing our large market opportunity. Those investments are expected to continue to ramp through the course of the fiscal year.\nFinally, a note on seasonality. Based on our current view of renewal's cohorts and visibility into land and expand, we expect revenue seasonality in fiscal Q3 relative to Q2 to be similar to what we saw in fiscal year '23.\nIn closing, we are pleased that our Q1 performance exceeded the high end of our guidance and would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, investors and stakeholders for their continued trust in us. We remain committed to continued progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth, both through durable top line growth and expanding margins.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Pinjalim Bora, JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora\nRajiv, one for you. Maybe can you talk about what are you hearing from customers around the VMS offering? Trying to understand if this new partnership with AWS. It might act as a catalyst to kind of convince people to move to NC2 or are you seeing any signs of that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nOkay. Pinjalim, Rajiv here. I think you meant VMC on AWS, correct? You said VMS --\nPinjalim Bora\nCorrect. VMC, correct.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nVMC on AWS, correct. Okay. All right. So clearly, I think that seems to be an offering that Broadcom is not focused on as much. And it's created an opportunity for us, for sure, and customers are concerned as to what might happen with their offering.\nFor example, the go cloud version of their offering, garment cloud version was apparently deprecated by Broadcom. So this is one of the impetus for the expanded partnership that we have with AWS, where we are working together with them to provide EVM migration for customers from BMC onto NC2 on AWS. We talked about one of the wins last quarter actually, leading universities that actually went and did exactly that. And anyway. So this is really one of the impetus why AWS is partnering with us.\nThey're offering immigration credit. The migration accelerator program, and we are working together to help customers who might be interested in migrating off that offering on to something else in the public\nPinjalim Bora\nYes. Understood. One for Rukmini. Rukmini, I'm trying to understand the guidance. It seems like a very solid Q1 beat.\nYou took the Q2 numbers up, but the second half seems like it's an implied guide down because you didn't take the full year number up. So I'm trying to understand, is that just prudent caution around what you're seeing on the sales cycles, Were there any deals that mkind of moved from the second half into the first half that changed the seasonality a bit? And lastly, do you think we're close to a trough on NRR?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Pinjalim. Both good questions. I'll start with your revenue guidance first. So yes, we were happy with our Q1 revenue performance, but we are only one quarter into fiscal year. And given the uncertain environment, including that related to a new administration in the US, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year top-line guide until we have a better view of how the rest of the year is going to play out.\nAnd as I noted in my prepared remarks, we continue to see these modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. And we believe that the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions, more approvals and causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in deal structure outcome and timing.\nAnd finally, from a seasonality perspective, we've historically seen a fairly even split in revenue between the first half and second half of the fiscal year. So our current expectations aren't that different from what we've seen historically.\nSo that's on the revenue top-line guidance question, Pinjalim. I think your second part of the question was around NRR. So a few things on NRR. First, I will say that given that our GRR, while we don't disclose it, we've said in the past that it has not changed significantly relative to recent levels. So given that, the largest driver of net new ARR is land and expand ACV, right?\nAnd your question specifically is on which does not, for example, benefit from the strength that we saw in our land. So I want to first start by clarifying that. And we did see some divergence there between sort of the strength in our land performance.\nNow with respect to expand, with existing customers, expand accounts for the majority of our land and expand, which was impacted largely by our US Fed business, which was lower year over year relative to the strong compare we had from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to the CR and the continuing resolutions in the US. And so all the dynamics you talked about in large sales cycle, larger deal sizes, various sales cycles or that does impact expand as well, Pinjalim. So that all did go into the NRR number.\nNow I think your question was around, is this the -- is this -- have we hit sort of the low point for NRR. We don't guide to NRR, as you know. But we do expect that and will be impacted by some of these factors that we've talked about like the sales cycles and the mix of large deals when we expect some of that to continue.\nSo that, we believe is the case, but we don't explicitly guide to NRR.\nOperator\nMeta Marshall, Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall\nGreat. Maybe following up on the federal piece. You noted in the script that you expected kind of fiscal Q2 to be better. I would expect you would need the administration change, so maybe you wouldn't expect kind of federal to improve until fiscal Q3, but just wanted to kind of listen about what went into that commentary or you could explain that more. And then maybe just a second question.\nJust any update on timing of Dell PowerFlex kind of integration? Just anything there would be helpful.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo Meta, on the federal question, I mean, we don't have visibility in terms of what the new administration is going to do or not do. So we can't really talk about what's going to happen after the new agitation comes in. So we have a near-term view on Q2, of course, which we factored in. And that's why we feel comfortable about our federal business coming back to more normal levels in Q2 based on what we know today. And of course, we'll have to see what the new administration does after they come on board.\nNow on the Dell question, specifically. So as you know, Meta, there's two parts to the Dell relationship. One is the existing hyper-converged solution that we have, which will be an appliance sale by combining our software on their service. That's been in the market now this quarter, and it's still early days for that.\nYour question on PowerFlex. We expect to have that in the market in the first half of calendar '25, and we expect to see some revenue contribution from it in FY26.\nOperator\nJim Fish, Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish\nI did want to build off of Meta's question and Pinjalim there a little bit. Can you just remind us how big this federal vertical can be for you guys here in fiscal Q1 versus kind of what you saw here? And what the actual impact net retention rate was? Like are we talking about a point or two difference that we would have seen versus the 110% or how to kind of quantify that?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nI'll take that, Jim. So First, on quantification of Fed, we don't disclose that, Jim. But as you can imagine and we've said this before, that for our Q1 is typically the seasonally strongest quarter given it's also the federal year-end, which covers September 30. So we don't disclose that number, Jim, but that is Q1 is our strongest Fed quarter. And similarly, right, we're not going to break out NRR impact by Fed or by any other sort of segmentation at this point.\nBut we did see the fact that overall Fed and expand specifically was lower than last year. It was a challenge for us in Q1 relative to what we saw last Q1, which was a strong one to compare.\nJames Fish\nGot it. And Rajiv, maybe for you. I think we're all kind of anxious to hear about when we could see more stand-alone into other storage arrays. Obviously, you just talked about the calendar first half of '25 seeing Dell PowerFlex. But how should we start thinking about Nutanix's relationships of getting stand-alone AHV integration into some of the other providers out there?\nAnd why we wouldn't start to see that AHV attach go from 7% today to faster to 100?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I think those are two different questions there, Jim. I think on the first question, clearly, the only one that we've announced so far has been Dell PowerFlex relationship. As you can imagine, we do have plans to expand that selectively to other storage arrays over time. I'm not going to preannounce anything right now, but you can assume that we are working on that in a very careful way. At the same time, we also want to make sure that whatever we do is actually focusing on expanding the market opportunity for us and doesn't cannibalize the existing HCI opportunity.\nSo we are focused specifically on working with storage array vendors that are workloads that would not necessarily be easier to capture with HCI because the workload we can capture with our own HCI platform, we would like to do that at the full stack.\nAnd over time, even for those that we do go in our goal is to sell the full stack over time. So stay tuned. I mean, we, of course, will continue to explore other options in the market when it comes to other storage arrays. And you can -- we don't have any more to say at this point. But the idea is to start with Dell and then over time expand to others.\nWith respect to your question on AHV penetration. Again, I think our philosophy has always been we support multiple hypervisors. And there's been a natural cadence to buy which the AHV adoption has continued to grow, and we are still at where it is. I don't necessarily need it to be 100%, frankly, but our goal is to increase the AHV footprint because we also want to be able to insert into VMware accounts, where our platform is running on top of ESX, the VMware hypervisor, and we'll continue to support that going forward as well.\nBut we would, of course, like to see more and more customers start to migrate over to our ASV footprint. And having, of course, this third-party storage support will only help amplify that.\nOperator\nJason Ader, William Blair.\nJason Ader\nSo when I look at the second half and you gave basically guidance revenue per quarter for the second half. But then looking at the operating margin for the year, you raised that only slightly after having pretty significant outperformance in Q1 and also guiding to a pretty robust operating margin in Q2. So that implies the second half is going to be kind of weigh down on the operating margin.\nAnd I know you said you're going to be ramping expenses, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing kind of idiosyncratic to the second half that we're not thinking about. And then can you talk about where that ramp up in spending is going to come. You said sales and marketing and R&D, but could you be more specific within those buckets.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nJason, first, on operating margin. So you're correct. So first, I'll start with revenue. What we said was -- I think in response to an earlier question, that our implied revenue split, first half to second half is roughly even based on the -- and that's similar to our historical patterns. While we expect operating expenses on the other hand, to grow over the course of the year, much like it did last fiscal year.\nSo to your point, you're correct that we will expect to see lower operating margins in the second half of the year and fiscal year '25. However, overall, we still expect to see year-over-year improvement in operating margin for the full fiscal year relative to fiscal year '24. And then to the second part of your question on where are we spending those dollars.\nSo first, in R&D, we have talked about investing, for example, in these AHV standalone to support the stand-alone storage arrays. So that's one area of R&D investment. Some other examples include we have ramped up our offerings around cloud native or containerized applications. That's another area generative AI plus our core enterprise platform, right, to the platform and making sure that it continues to evolve. So even within our core platforms, there are innovations that we continue to drive.\nSo that's on the R&D side, some examples of where we're investing.\nOn the sales and marketing side, we have talked about some investments we've made -- some we made last year and some will continue into this year, for example, around product specialist sellers, folks who are focused on selling our entire portfolio and helping our main field sellers go do that. We have increased some investments around the channel as another example, some inside sales folks who can be focused on driving both expansion and land around the more mid-market tiers. So those are some examples of areas that we're investing in both sales and marketing and in R&D.\nOperator\nWamsi Mohan, Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nIt's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Rukmini, the renewals business has been strong. How should we think about the growth in available to renew pool in fiscal '25 versus fiscal '24? And is there any danger that renewals kind of fall off a cliff in fiscal '26? Or is there a large enough cohort of customers who are going to renew in fiscal '26 that strong growth in renewals continues and it grows as a mix of the business.\nSo just your thoughts on available to renew pool and how you see that business continuing to grow?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. So you're correct that we did talk about renewals doing well for Q1. In terms of ATR for full year fiscal year '25, I think we referred to this in our last earnings call when we gave you all the initial guide for fiscal year '25. Available to the new pool or ATR is expected to grow nicely in '25 year over year versus '24, and we'll continue to grow quite nicely over the next few years, Ruplu. So I'm not going to give you a quantification for fiscal year '26 at this point.\nWe're still only one quarter into '25. But yes, we expect that growth in available to renew for our renewal cohorts to continue for the next couple of years.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nOkay. And maybe for my follow-up, I'll ask you another question. Free cash flow in fiscal 1Q was very strong. It was $152 million, which I don't think, over the last three, four years, you've had such a strong 1Q. Were there any one-time items?\nI know last quarter, you had said that you might get from a partner, I think you had said $30 million benefit for the full year in terms of free cash flow. So any guidance on how we should think about the progression of free cash flow first half versus second half in this year?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. We were happy with our free cash flow performance in Q1, as you alluded to. So nothing significant, I would call out as onetime. So you're right, those partner payments, we did call out for fiscal year '25 and those will continue to come in. They might be a little inconsistent in terms of quarter to quarter, but we're not breaking that out quarterly, Ruplu.\nThere wasn't any one thing I would call out. For example, in Q4, in our July quarter, we did call out there was one significant deal that we collected in that quarter. For example, there was nothing like that, that I would call out for Q1. And more generally, I think when you think about just, I think rest of the year, part of your question is $152 million was a strong Q1, and our full-year guide is $560 million to $610 million. And so I'll just remind you that, one, expenses are going up, expected to go up through the rest of the year.\nSo keep that in mind, right, those expenses will ramp over the course of the year, much like they did last fiscal year. So that in. And we do collect multiple years of cash from our customers typically upfront. And so that does mean that depending on duration or depending on some larger deals, there can be some variation quarter to quarter in that number, which is why we continue to guide for free cash flow really on an annual basis only.\nOperator\nMike Cikos, Needham.\nMichael Cikos\nI'm going to ask a boring one on guidance and build on some of the line of questioning that Mr. Rader was going after on the operating margin and the operating profit. But I just wanted to get a better understanding congratulations on the 20% operating margin we're seeing here in Q1.\nIs the view for full year in any way informed like are we potentially behind on hiring versus where we expected to be exiting Q1? Or are you potentially increasing your view of additional investments in sales and marketing and R&D? Because I know that's something that we had flagged on the previous quarter. Just wanted to wrestle those two items.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Mike. Always welcome the boring question on the guide. So thank you for that. Not at all boring, actually. It's very, very practical.\nSo when we think of spend and our planning cycles, Mike. So we're coming out of our planning cycle. And so as we deploy this, again, similar to last fiscal year, some of this will be ramping over the course of the year. So that is in the plan. And so you'll continue to see that this year relative to last year, right?\nSo there's nothing unusual or different necessarily that I would call out other than, of course, as we hire people in Q1 or Q2, they might be there for partially for that quarter. But then for the next quarter, they're there for the full quarter, right? So there is that almost normalization that happened over the course of the year. And so that's what's baked into the op margin guide for the full year relative to what you saw in Q1.\nMichael Cikos\nGot it. And then just one other, if I could. I know that we're -- and I appreciate the commentary here as well as far as the Q2 versus 3Q seasonality on revenue. I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about this properly, even if I go back beyond last year, two years ago, we tend to see coal at a 7% to 8%, 7% feels about right as far as a sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3. And I appreciate your qualitative comments, but if you could further elaborate on that.\nWhat is driving that seasonal component? Is it really tied to year-end in Q2 and then maybe the sales incentive comp for your sales force in Q4? Is that why we should be thinking about that Q2 to Q3 sequential movements that we're talking to?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nYou're exactly right, Mike. So historically, if you look at our performance, Q2 and Q4 tend to be seasonally stronger quarters from a top line perspective, exactly for the recency outline because Q2 has the December year-end. And Q4 had our end of fiscal year, and therefore, some sales incentives tied to a strong finish there. What has happened also is as we now have the renewal cohorts layering in, they tend to follow similarly the land expand performance in the past because they're just reflective of deals that were signed and when those renewals view.\nSo now we have the impact of historical land and expand, but the renewal cohorts are also following that pattern. So we just wanted to remind folks of that going into Q3 and give you a sense of qualitatively, what to expect relative to the Q2 guidance.\nOperator\nBen Bollin, Cleveland Research Company.\nBen Bollin\nRajiv, I wanted to get your perspective a bigger picture on enterprise refresh behavior, in particular, around how you see customers evolving around three-tier versus HCI? Any thoughts on the pace and rate of enterprise on-prem AI deployments?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I'll take those two questions separately. I don't think Ben that much has changed with respect to three-tier versus HCI. We still continue to validate the proposition of 40% -- 40% to 50% lower TCO if you replace your three-tier with SCI and it also provides you the platform to really expand into becoming a hybrid cloud, which is what companies want. And so over time, I do expect to continue to see HCI gain into the legacy three-tier offering. So that part hasn't really changed.\nThe dynamics really haven't changed. Of course, it's usually tied to a hardware refresh cycle because that's when you refresh your storage arrays. And instead of refreshing storage here is what we tell customers when they just buy simple servers and put HCI on it. So no change really on that front.\nOn enterprise AI, what we see again is that the bulk of the spend so far have been not really in the enterprise, but in these large hyperscalers as they build out these massive clusters to train these large language models with huge investments from a small handful of very large providers. So we see that for sure.\nNow within the enterprise, most enterprises are, I would say, in the early stages of deploying Generative AI, largely for RAG relative long into generation and fine-tuning and inferencing. They're not going to train these models. They're going to use models that are pre-existing and then use them to drive inferencing but more cost-effective, smaller clusters. We think that, that segment of the market is in early stages. We have seen the first set of applications come about.\nEven this quarter, as you know, we talked about this government customer in EMEA that's starting to use our GPT 2.0 offering. I would say most enterprises are in the early stages of adoption, including ourselves, where we're targeting to see things like a 25% productivity gain for our developers, our improvements in how we manage legal contracts. So companies looking at fraud detection. These are the kind of use cases that we're starting to see emerge. But I would say it's in the early days.\nMost enterprises are only now getting into the act of trying to build these applications. And I do think that this space is going to continue to grow over the next few years, but it's still largely incubation at this point in the enterprise.\nBen Bollin\nThat's great. And Rukmini, if I could. In the past, you had provided some perspective on the growth of $1 million-plus deals in your pipeline relative to the remainder of the business. Curious if you have any updates on that metric exiting the quarter?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ben. I will say we are continuing to see nice growth in our pipeline, including for the larger deals that we've talked about before, Ben, we're not updating those metrics specifically on a quarterly basis. But yes, we are seeing continued interest and engagement and growth in pipeline from those $1 million-plus sort of cohorts and more generally.\nOperator\nSimon Leopold, Raymond James.\nVictor Chiu\nThis is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to drill into your commentary around the increased customer engagement from VMware Basin. Maybe help us understand if this was an incremental acceleration relative to what you were previously observing? If so, maybe help us understand what's driving that and if you expect that to continue?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo, Victor, the market continues to be dynamic. But from our perspective, it's still largely unchanged in terms of our opportunity, a multiyear opportunity to gain share. So we haven't seen a significant change in that this quarter compared to the last several quarters really. And we haven't seen any real meaningful changes in our win-loss rate size around these opportunities. I'll say what we've already said before, right, a lot of these deals are tied to VMware customers, their ELA renewal cycles.\nThey try to when the installed base is coming up for a hardware refresh, although we are also expanding our ability to capture -- to have our solutions work on existing hardware like, for example, the three-tier work that we're doing with Dell or like continuing to be able to deploy our software on already existing BMS HCI customers. And of course, it's a dynamic market in the sense that sometimes we see aggressive behavior from Broadcom as well to keep those customers especially the very large ones. So really, I would say, net-net, nothing much has changed.\nVictor Chiu\nOkay. And if the organization decides that they wanted to move away from VMware kind of, on average, how long is that transition typically? And kind of what are the steps involved that required for a customer to do something like that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nCorrect. It depends on the scale and complexity of their deployment. So if they are -- for example, I'll give you the two bookends. So on the small -- on the easy side, if they are just largely the say, vSphere customer and they're willing to replace their hardware. It's a very easy migration.\nWe can migrate that within a month or two off a relatively small scale. A lot of that is automated as well. Same goes for public cloud to public cloud. And there was a question earlier about VMS Cloud on AWS. Those offerings are actually very easy to migrate.\nAgain, this in a month, we can have those customers off and on to a tan offer. But at the other end of the spectrum are these large customers that use multiple VMware products with massive estates. And there, it can be many years. It can be three years to do a migration. Just because they can't migrate all of it at once, there is a requirement for a professional services engagement to convert over some of their more complex custom scripts, they have return on customer investments they've made on top of the VMS portfolio.\nSo those migrations tend to be complex, require professional services and take a few years. So there's an entire spectrum across those.\nVictor Chiu\nDo you have maybe kind of a general ballpark kind of estimation of what percentage is the easy kind of low-hanging fruit? And what --?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I would say if you look at -- with the exception of, I think, if you go to a large Tier 1 big global accounts, those are the ones that are difficult, right? The vast majority of the smaller customers are going to be more on the easy side.\nOperator\nMatt Hedberg, RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg\nI just wanted to ask, obviously, it sounds like the federal business had some headwinds. Maybe just a simple question, but Rajiv, did the enterprise business, do you think it deteriorated from a demand perspective versus last quarter? Just because it seems like good revolve, but just trying to get a kind of finer point on sort of like your thought on enterprise spending today versus maybe many days ago?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. Matt, clearly, we saw the softness in Fed for sure. We saw it -- that was a very clear cut. The broader enterprise, I we've actually, again, been doing quite well at landing new logos and people migrating. But of course, some of that is perhaps due to just what's happening with the Broadcom situation.\nSo we haven't seen a decline in enterprise spend or less willingness to spend. What we have seen, and we've been talking about this in multiple quarters, Matt, is lot more inspection going on the Fed and a lot more approvals being required higher in the food chain, looking at TCO more carefully, which, of course, plays to our benefit in some articles what we talk about in this environment is how we can reduce TCO.\nSo that dynamic has been going on now for several quarters. We haven't seen much of a change. So net-net, I have to say it for the broader enterprise demand, we haven't seen a change this quarter compared to the prior quarters.\nMatthew Hedberg\nGot it. That's very clear. And then maybe another sort of, I guess, macro question for Rukmini. Obviously, it's not your year-end, but do you typically see a December budget flush from an enterprise percent? I can't imagine you're baking that into guidance.\nJust kind of curious on historically, do you see customers kind of spend it or lose it mentality when it comes to December, your calendar year end?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nI mean certainly, sometimes, right? I mean they may have a budget that's available for this year. We've seen that in the past. We probably will see some of that this year as well, right? I mean I think they do have -- I mean, if your company is on that calendar cycle, yes, you probably will have some budget to spend -- but again, I would not say we factor whatever we can see into our guide for Q2.\nSo nothing really different this year compared to prior years. And so typically, we see a seasonal increase in Q2 compared to Q1. And that's driven in part by the fact that what you alluded to, Matt, but people spending at the end of the year.\nOperator\nGeorge Wang, Barclays.\nI just had two quick ones. Firstly, can you kind of double-click in terms of the channel incentives in place kind of what has changed versus three months ago in terms of providing the promo and the incentives to the channel, especially at the backdrop of for maybe overlapping Nutanix or VMware contract?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean this is a few months ago that we made the change, no recent changes, by the way, on the channel side. We made that going a while ago. But what we did, we did a couple of things there, Joe. First thing we did was we took a subset of our customer base, our target prospects and handed them off entirely to the channel to go drive.\nAnd so we don't have our reps on those accounts. We leave it to the channel, and we provided more incentives to those channel partners to bring us business. So we have incentives in place for our channel partners to bring new logos to us in terms of rewards that they will get more rewards when they bring new logos to us. We are also committed to the channel in the sense that all our deals go through the channel partners. So we're not trying to work around them or shut them out of any of the deals.\nAnd so we've seen, certainly, as a result of all of that, a significant increase in channel partner engagement with us over the last year or two. Some of it is, of course, just what they're seeing with Broadcom, more child partners coming to us, some of it is our own incentives that we are offering for them.\nAnd we also have incentives for the end customer as well, right? So for example, to help them tide over migrations, we can offer them free licenses for a period of time to help them while they're still spending money on VMware to get going on our products until they're ready to go migrate fully over.\nOkay. Just a follow-up, if I can. Just in terms of repatriation, just as kind of a theme, which benefits on Nutanix. Just curious if anything has changed on the repenetration, any additional data points versus last quarter?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. In terms of cloud repatriation, I would say we haven't seen like a massive repatriation of workloads coming back from the public cloud. We see some of that here and there, right? That's where I would characterize it not has changed compared to past quarter. But I think what we see is, again, I can see there is people are much more careful about what they go put in the cloud.\nSo keep in mind that the vast majority of enterprise workloads are still on-prem, not in the public cloud. And now CIOs are being more circumspect about what to use the public cloud for. For example, there's a realization that if we have steady-state workloads, those workloads can be run more efficiently on-prem than in the public cloud. And so this CIO of therefore saying, well, I'm going to keep that workload on-prem. I'm not going to move that to the public cloud.\nSo that's what we are seeing.\nOperator\nNehal Chokshi, Northland Capital Markets.\nNehal Chokshi\nCongrats on the really strong new logo up to 2% year-over-year. That's really impressive. I'm trying to put though, why is ARR decelerating given the strong land that you're seeing? And then if I look at the incremental ARR, i.e., the change quarter-over-quarter or October quarter, relative to the year ago quarter, that was down a lot as well. So thoughts on why are there such a weak incremental ARR characteristics, especially given the backdrop that you're having such strong WAN metrics?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nNehal, thank you. So a few things to -- I'll start with on your point about net new ARR. So One of the biggest drivers of net new ARR, which is simply, as you pointed out, the difference between ARR in this quarter versus the prior quarter is land and expand ACV. And given that our GRR has not changed significantly relative to recent historical levels. And so when you think about land and expand, we did see some divergence, as you point out in the performance of the land versus the expand portion of our business.\nSo we saw strength in the new customers. And we've talked about why that is. And so really happy with that performance.\nExpansion with existing customers, which actually accounts for the majority of the land and expand was impacted largely by our US federal business, Nihal, and we've talked about why we believe that will be the case. And so -- and overall, by the way, right, we've talked about these larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline which are taking longer to close and have data variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. So all of those factors also do impact our ARR growth. So that's how to think about just ARR and net new ARR.\nOperator\nMichael, Wells Fargo.\nI'll ask one on behalf of Aaron. I just want to ask about GPT 2.0 or GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution. I'm just curious, as you think about, I guess, the positioning of that in the marketplace relative to kind of a full stack or a three-tier architecture with NVIDIA's AI enterprise software suite. How do these differ in terms of where they sit in the market that I guess do you see opportunity to maybe move up market as these solutions mature going forward?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean some of that is also a difference between training and inferencing. We are largely with GPT-in-a-Box focused on influencing, focusing on smaller clusters, not massive compute funds to our trade models. Smaller clusters that enterprises can use to deploy more cost-effective AI inferencing applications. I'll give you one example.\nWe, for example, one of our first use cases in Nutanix internally, was a customer service use case where incoming service request from a customer support ticket, the support engineer actually has a natural language into search interface through which they enter the query and then we look through all-on-one basis to try and accelerate our -- the ability to answer that issue. And that AI application is running on just a small cluster, okay, leaving an open source large language model.\nAnd that's the kind of upstarting on GPT-in-a-Box internally. And that's the kind of use case that we're enabling for the enterprise, where you have your secure data, you want to do your inferencing on it, using existing models that are already pretrained, but fine-tuned with your use cases. So that's a cost-optimized solution.\nAnd by the way, we are partnered with NVIDIA on that because we work with the immediate inferencing solution as well as, of course, using their GPUs to do all the hard work needed here. So again, I just think we want to distinguish between influencing on small clusters, which is mostly what we do versus training of very large clusters.\nThat's helpful. And if I can sneak one more in. Just as we think about an improving sort of traditional server end demand environment and as we think about refresh cycles. Obviously, that presents an insertion opportunity for you guys within three-tier architecture. So I'm curious with the new partnerships with Dell and Cisco.\nHave you seen your win rates at all changing? Or do you anticipate those improving given your kind of broader ability to enter those deals?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. First of all, I think I think Cisco and Dell selling our products is, of course, positive for us. And Cisco has been a good contributor to our new logos this quarter as well as last quarter. That is still, I think, very early days for us. And that's independent of the server refresh cycle or not, right?\nSecond, I would say, with respect to refresh cycles, yes, server refreshes will help, but also storage of freshers are important, right? Because that's when we get the opportunity to displace those three-tier architectures with HCI footprint. So both matter. I think having Dell and Cisco as friends in the market, of course, significantly helps. And at the same time, the refresh cycles -- more so, I would say storage or fresh and server refresh will help us insert HCI into existing deployments.\nOperator\nThank you, and thanks for participating. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on December 12, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.39, reflecting a 25.23% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $14.06 billion, indicating a 51.29% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Broadcom Inc. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Broadcom Inc. is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Broadcom Inc. is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.85. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 35.5.\nMeanwhile, AVGO's PEG ratio is currently 1.63. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Electronics - Semiconductors industry stood at 1.77 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 144, putting it in the bottom 43% of all 250+ industries.\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.\nOn November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nThe investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.\n8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nA close up of a circuit board, its microchips creating a powerful computing system.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024.

Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.42%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.83%.\nThe the stock of maker of software that automates companies' technology operations has risen by 11.62% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.44% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.11%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of ServiceNow in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $3.60, indicating a 15.76% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.96 billion, up 21.28% from the prior-year quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.87 per share and revenue of $10.97 billion. These totals would mark changes of +28.66% and +22.33%, respectively, from last year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for ServiceNow should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. At present, ServiceNow boasts a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nInvestors should also note ServiceNow's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 75.09. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 30.22 for its industry.\nWe can also see that NOW currently has a PEG ratio of 3.05. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Computers - IT Services industry stood at 2.82 at the close of the market yesterday.\nStory Continues\nThe Computers - IT Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 39, which puts it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NOW) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$4.16b\nUS$5.10b\nUS$5.77b\nUS$6.93b\nUS$7.78b\nUS$8.51b\nUS$9.14b\nUS$9.68b\nUS$10.2b\nUS$10.6b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x24\nAnalyst x16\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 12.25%\nEst @ 9.36%\nEst @ 7.34%\nEst @ 5.92%\nEst @ 4.93%\nEst @ 4.24%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%\nUS$3.9k\nUS$4.5k\nUS$4.7k\nUS$5.3k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\nStory Continues\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$11b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$253b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$253b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$130b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$182b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$1.0k, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNYSE:NOW Discounted Cash Flow November 29th 2024\nImportant Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ServiceNow as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.042. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for ServiceNow\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nMoving On:\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +9.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share, indicating a change of +15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)\nWhat a fantastic six months it\u2019s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is NOW a Good Business?\nFounded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.\n1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nServiceNow\u2019s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters,\u00a0its year-on-year growth averaged\u00a024.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nSell-side analysts expect ServiceNow\u2019s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nServiceNow\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate\nServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\nStory Continues\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on ServiceNow, and with the recent rally, the stock trades at 17.6x forward price-to-sales (or $1,055 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than ServiceNow\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we\u2019re here to help you pick them.\nGet started by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like United Rentals (+550% five-year return).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAs the \u201cAI arms race\u201d continues to evolve, countries are increasingly beginning to realize the efforts they need to expend to stay relevant. One such country in the picture that\u2019s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Updates You Can\u2019t Miss This Weekend and Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight\nThe remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do \"everything they can to lock their digital doors\" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\"While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it\".\nMcFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.\nIn other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.\nThe search, which started on November 1st\u00a0took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it \u201ccannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs\u2019 copied articles were used to build [OpenAI\u2019s] models\u201d.\nStory Continues\n\u201cNews plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week\u2019s worth of its experts\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today\u201d.\nOpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.\nOn November 25, Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and a $1,150.00 price target. Key factors noted during a recent investor meeting have led to this buy rating. A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities. Another factor adding to the positive outlook is the disciplined approach to Pro Plus (the company's new generative AI SKU) pricing. The pressure on the Subscription Gross Margin in the coming year has already been factored into the analysis.\nOverall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nWhat's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?\nServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nCan we expect growth from ServiceNow?\nNYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nIf you'd like to know more about ServiceNow as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company\u2019s future relations with the government.\nIn a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.\nThis also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn\u2019t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock\u2019s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow ranks 24th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 97 hedge fund portfolios held NOW at the end of the second quarter which was 90 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?
