          "whole_article": "The country\u2019s tech titans might need to start fortifying defenses against the agenda of incoming Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr.\nCarr made that clear in the hour after Trump announced his ascension to the FCC chairmanship seat last month.\n\"We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans,\" Carr said on X, the social media platform.\nJust days before he got that chairmanship appointment, Carr sent letters to Google (GOOG, GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple (APPL) CEO Tim Cook predicting \"broad ranging actions to restore Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights\" once Trump takes office.\nThat might include \"a review of your companies\u2019 activities as well as third-party organizations and groups that have acted to curtail those rights,\" according to a copy of the letter Carr posted to X.\nMany tech CEOs are trying to establish a good relationship with the incoming Trump administration, hoping to improve their standing in the nation's capital after years of aggressive oversight and antitrust lawsuits. Last week, for example, Zuckerberg met face-to-face with Trump at his Florida hotel and club Mar-a-Lago.\nCarr has long called for a focus on reining in Big Tech. He has accused Alphabet-owned Google of manipulating search results and demonizing YouTube users, Meta-owned Facebook of inconsistently tinkering with user content, and Chinese-owned TikTok of jeopardizing national security.\nCarr has also outlined his vision for a remake of the FCC in a right-of-center policy proposal known as Project 2025. Trump distanced himself from that document during the 2024 presidential campaign.\nOne specific focus for a new Republican-oriented FCC, Carr said in Project 2025, should be to do away with legal immunity known as Section 230 protection that insulates social media companies from liability when they police third party content.\nStory Continues\nCarr said dominant technology corporations abuse their dominant market position and Section 230\u2019s legal protection to \"drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.\"\n\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the chapter he authored on the FCC.\nFederal Communications Commission commissioner Brendan Carr while testifying in June 2020 before a Senate committee. Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\n\"They are not simply prevailing in the free market; they are taking advantage of a landscape that has been skewed\u2014in many cases by the government\u2014to favor their business models.\"\nAs a remedy, Carr said Congress should not only remove \"carte blanche\" Section 230 immunity but also impose transparency rules similar to those that imposed on broadband providers.\nThat would require social media platforms to publish more specific terms of service and operate an appeals process for content creators to challenge companies that take down their posts.\nFight for the Future, a nonprofit group that advocates for online privacy, expressed concerns in an email to Yahoo Finance that Carr would upend net neutrality rules, which require internet service providers (ISPs) to treat all data on the Internet equally.\nCarr voted to end net neutrality rules in 2017.\nCarr in Project 2025 also said the FCC should do more to protect Americans against already identified national and personal security threats posed by the social media app TikTok, and telecommunication equipment manufacturers, Huawei and ZTE.\nTikTok\u2019s platform, Carr said, provides Beijing \"with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign\" by curating news and information seen by millions of Americans.\nCongress and President Joe Biden agreed months ago to outlaw TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nCongress and President Joe Biden agreed months ago to outlaw TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail suggested he may at least try to lessen the impact of a law signed by Biden in April that makes Chinese ownership of the app illegal.\nCarr also has called for the FCC to do a better job at updating its \"covered list\" of telecommunications equipment manufactures that pose a risk to US national security, Carr said.\nHuawei and ZTE are included in that list. And a loophole, he said, should be closed so that companies like China Telecom, cannot operate unregulated data centers in the US.\nCarr has said Big Tech should pay its \"fair share\" into the FCC\u2019s $9 billion universal service fund that subsidizes affordable Internet and rural connectivity programs.\nInstead of relying on telecommunications consumers for the bulk of its funding, he said, Big Tech should pay because the federally supported networks are used to deliver the company products and services.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

Reinforcement learning models, commonly used for AI decision-making, often fail when facing minor changes in their training tasks. MBTL strategically selects the most impactful tasks to train on, improving overall performance while reducing training costs.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nFor example, controlling traffic in a city involves numerous intersections with varying conditions. Instead of training separate algorithms for each intersection or one generalized algorithm for all, MBTL identifies and trains on a subset of key intersections. It leverages zero-shot transfer learning, allowing trained models to perform well on untrained, similar tasks.

          "whole_article": "Stocks will enter the final month of 2024 near record highs as investors look to cap off what's been another stellar year for US stocks.\nDuring last week's holiday-shortened trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 2%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended November at all-time highs.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's November jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also scatter the schedule.\nInvestors will look to this week's economic data for clarity on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, which will be announced on Dec. 18.\nIn corporate news, earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Okta (OKTA), and Lululemon (LULU) will highlight the coming week's schedule.\n\u2022 USD\n(^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA labor look-in\nExpectations for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have shifted in recent months.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a 66% chance the Fed cuts rates at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But looking out further, markets are pricing in just two more rate cuts over the next year, with concerns growing about the Fed's progress on bringing down inflation.\nA labor market that continues to slow, but not dramatically, also likely keeps the Fed focused on inflation, which makes a less compelling case for aggressive rate cuts in 2025. An update on that narrative will come with the November jobs report, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nEconomists expect the report to show a reversal of the dismal October employment report that many believed was heavily impacted by hurricanes and worker strikes.\nThe November report is expected to show the US labor market added 200,000 jobs in the month, up from the 12,000 monthly job additions seen in October. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to have inched up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\"Through the monthly swings of nonfarm payrolls, we expect the November employment report to reiterate that while the labor market remains solid in an absolute sense, the softening trend in employment conditions has yet to cease,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients. \"That message is likely to come through more clearly from the unemployment rate, which we look to rise to 4.2%.\"\nStory Continues\n'Magnificent' earnings revisions\nWall Street strategists have been largely bullish when issuing 2025 forecasts, with strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance seeing the S&P 500 ending the year between 6,400 and 7,000. A frequent call in these outlooks has been for a continued broadening of the stock market rally away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 and toward the other 493 stocks in the index.\n\"We\u2019ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it\u2019s a close call,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote, emphasizing that another strong year of economic growth could help support the S&P 493.\nBut not everyone agrees. Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out that Big Tech continues to top earnings estimates each quarter. And as long as that streak continues, Krishna argued \"Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year.\"\nTo Krishna's point, while the broadening is expected to take place throughout next year, earnings revisions remain more positive for many Big Tech names than the rest of the S&P 500.\nIn a research note published on Nov. 27, DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe pointed out that six Big Tech companies have seen earnings revisions for the current quarter come in either flat or higher in the past 30 days. Only Microsoft and Apple have seen their earnings estimates cut more than the S&P 500's 1.2% estimate trim in that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500's 10 largest non-tech companies have seen earnings estimates slashed by an average of 2.7%.\n\"US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings,\" Rabe wrote. \"Fortunately, Big Tech makes up a third of the S&P, so their fundamentals have an outsized impact on the index.\"\nThe case for a strong December\nAnother popular call among strategists has been for the roaring bull market to continue through year-end, with more all-time highs in store before trading wraps up in 2024.\nAnd history supports that argument.\nCarson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that, in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 out of 10 times. Since 2000, the index has risen every December after a rally of this magnitude over the year's first 11 months.\n\"History says a chase into year-end is quite possible,\" Detrick wrote in a research note.\nWeekly Calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, November final (48.8 expected, 48.8 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, October (0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); ISM Manufacturing, November (47.6 expected, 46.5 previously); ISM prices paid, November (54.8 expected);\nEarnings: Zscaler (ZS)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: Job openings, October (7.51 million expected, 7.44 million previously);\nEarnings: Box (BOX), Marvell (MRVL), Okta (OKTA), Pure Storage (PSTG), Salesforce (CRM)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Nov. 29 (+6.3% previously); ADP Private Payrolls, November (+165,000 expected, +233,000 previously); S&P Global US Services PMI, November final (57 previously), S&P Global US Composite PMI, November final (55.3 previously); ISM Services index, November (55.5 expected, 56 previously); ISM Services prices paid, November (58.1 previously); Factory orders, October (0.3% expected, -0.5% previously); Durable goods orders, October final (+0.2% previously)\nEarnings: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Campbell's (CPB), ChargePoint (CHPT), Chewy (CHWY), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below (FIVE), Foot Locker (FL), Hormel Foods (HRL), RBC (RBC), Victoria's Secret (VSCO)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, November (+50.9% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Nov. 30 (213,000 previously)\nEarnings: BMO (BMO), Build-a-Bear Workshop (BBW), Dollar General (DG), DocuSign (DOCU), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Kroger (KR), Lululemon (LULU), Petco (WOOF), TD Bank (TD), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\nFriday\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, November (+200,000 expected, +12,000 previously); Unemployment rate, November (4.2% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+3.9% expected, +4% previously); Average weekly hours worked, November (34.3 expected, 34.3 previously); Labor force participation rate, November (62.6% previously)\nEarnings: BRP (DOOO)\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

While I remain bullish on both investments, my preference is heavily skewed toward buying Microsoft over Meta at this time.\nDon't Miss our Black Friday Offers:\nUnlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF!\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\nMeta Has Been Stealthily Winning the AI Arms Race\nI\u2019m bullish on Meta, which has been investing heavily in AI, committing a substantial $35 billion to the technology in 2024 alone. The company is leveraging its vast ecosystem of apps\u2014including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger\u2014to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities. For instance, the introduction of Meta AI, an assistant built on its Llama 3 language model, has reached 500 million users within just seven months.\nIn addition to its aggressive AI investments, Meta has differentiated itself by open-sourcing its AI models, such as Llama 3. While competitors like OpenAI and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) typically keep their models proprietary, Meta\u2019s open-source strategy fosters innovation and collaboration, enabling other technology companies and developers to test and improve its models.\nMoreover, Meta is a leader in AI model transparency. It has developed methodologies to make AI decision-making processes fully interpretable, addressing the \u201cblack box\u201d problem in AI. By pioneering transparency and accountability, Meta is positioning itself as a responsible leader in the AI industry\u2014a critical advantage as AI adoption expands into high-stakes fields such as healthcare and finance.\nMETA Stock\u2019s Valuation\nMeta\u2019s rise in AI, though initially unexpected, is now firmly on the radar of technology investors. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the company is trading near all-time highs. However, what should it be trading at? To value the firm, I first estimate Meta\u2019s full-year 2034 EBITDA at $278.65 billion. Assuming a conservative EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 12.3, reflecting slower growth expectations compared to recent years, Meta\u2019s December 2034 enterprise value would be $3.43 trillion.\nWith a median weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of approximately 8.5% over the past decade, I then discount this forecasted enterprise value back to December 2024, arriving at an intrinsic value of $1.52 trillion. As Meta\u2019s current enterprise value is $1.41 trillion, this implies a modest 7.6% margin of safety for investors.\nStory Continues\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About Meta?\nMeta currently holds a Strong Buy consensus rating on Wall Street, with an average META price target of $662.62, implying 15.4% upside potential. This is based on 40 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell, further supporting my view that Meta is a viable investment option.\nSee more META analyst ratings\nMicrosoft Is Dominating in AI and Is Undervalued\nI\u2019m also highly bullish on Microsoft, which has a commanding presence in cloud-based AI, particularly through its Azure platform. It leads in traditional AI and generative AI adoption, boasting the highest number of new AI customers and generative AI users compared to peers AWS (AMZN) and Google. Microsoft\u2019s leadership is reinforced by its partnership with OpenAI, which has enabled seamless integration of cutting-edge AI technologies into its cloud services.\nUnlike Meta, Microsoft has a clear and direct monetization pathway for its AI capabilities. The company has integrated AI across its product suite, enhancing user experiences with tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is now used by nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies.\nMicrosoft also prioritizes ethical and transparent AI, which is crucial for its focus on high-impact sectors such as healthcare. Its advancements in multimodal medical imaging and AI-driven nursing workflow solutions are significantly improving patient care. Furthermore, Microsoft\u2019s AI initiatives extend into finance, customer service, and defense, as seen through its collaboration with Palantir (PLTR) on AI solutions for Western defense.\nMSFT Stock\u2019s Valuation\nTo value Microsoft, I first estimate its December 2034 EBITDA at $616.8 billion. Applying a conservative EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 20.3\u2014aligned with the midpoint of its 10-year median and five-year average\u2014my forecast for Microsoft\u2019s enterprise value by December 2034 is $12.52 trillion.\nFurthermore, Microsoft\u2019s WACC stands at 9.81%, with equity making up 97.64% and debt accounting for 2.36%. After discounting my December 2034 forecast back to December 2024, I calculate an intrinsic enterprise value of $4.91 trillion. Given Microsoft\u2019s current enterprise value of $3.13 trillion, this represents a substantial 56.91% margin of safety for investors.\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About Microsoft?\nMicrosoft also has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Wall Street, with an average MSFT price target of $496.92, implying 17.35% upside potential. This rating is supported by 26 Buys, three Holds, and no Sells, reinforcing my thesis that Microsoft is an attractive investment opportunity.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nConclusion: Microsoft Is the Better Investment\nWhile both Meta and Microsoft are poised for substantial long-term growth driven by their strategic positions in AI, Microsoft offers the better investment opportunity today due to its superior valuation and monetization strategy. Even if Meta succeeds in developing the most advanced AI models, its ability to monetize these capabilities may be more challenging compared to Microsoft\u2019s established pathways. Given the security and stability that Microsoft provides, I favor buying its stock while holding off on Meta for now.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

The AI models behind the famous AI assistant have, however, started to attract unwanted attention in recent months. For example, news publication The Guardian has reported that a group of major news organizations in Canada have sued the AI firm for allegedly strip-mining journalism and unjustly enriching itself by using news articles to train the popular ChatGPT software.

The latest suit, per the report, includes news platforms like the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Press, the CBC, the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, and Postmedia. The companies want up to C$20,000 in damages for each article used by OpenAI, suggesting a victory in court could be worth billions.

Last week, for example, Zuckerberg met face-to-face with Trump at his Florida hotel and club Mar-a-Lago.\nCarr has long called for a focus on reining in Big Tech. He has accused Alphabet-owned Google of manipulating search results and demonizing YouTube users, Meta-owned Facebook of inconsistently tinkering with user content, and Chinese-owned TikTok of jeopardizing national security.\nCarr has also outlined his vision for a remake of the FCC in a right-of-center policy proposal known as Project 2025. Trump distanced himself from that document during the 2024 presidential campaign.\nOne specific focus for a new Republican-oriented FCC, Carr said in Project 2025, should be to do away with legal immunity known as Section 230 protection that insulates social media companies from liability when they police third party content.\nStory Continues\nCarr said dominant technology corporations abuse their dominant market position and Section 230\u2019s legal protection to \"drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.\"\n\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the chapter he authored on the FCC.\nFederal Communications Commission commissioner Brendan Carr while testifying in June 2020 before a Senate committee.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nCongress and President Joe Biden agreed months ago to outlaw TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail suggested he may at least try to lessen the impact of a law signed by Biden in April that makes Chinese ownership of the app illegal.\nCarr also has called for the FCC to do a better job at updating its \"covered list\" of telecommunications equipment manufactures that pose a risk to US national security, Carr said.\nHuawei and ZTE are included in that list. And a loophole, he said, should be closed so that companies like China Telecom, cannot operate unregulated data centers in the US.\nCarr has said Big Tech should pay its \"fair share\" into the FCC\u2019s $9 billion universal service fund that subsidizes affordable Internet and rural connectivity programs.\nInstead of relying on telecommunications consumers for the bulk of its funding, he said, Big Tech should pay because the federally supported networks are used to deliver the company products and services.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Stocks will enter the final month of 2024 near record highs as investors look to cap off what's been another stellar year for US stocks.\nDuring last week's holiday-shortened trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 2%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended November at all-time highs.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's November jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also scatter the schedule.\nInvestors will look to this week's economic data for clarity on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, which will be announced on Dec. 18.\nIn corporate news, earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Okta (OKTA), and Lululemon (LULU) will highlight the coming week's schedule.\n\u2022 USD\n(^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA labor look-in\nExpectations for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have shifted in recent months.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a 66% chance the Fed cuts rates at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But looking out further, markets are pricing in just two more rate cuts over the next year, with concerns growing about the Fed's progress on bringing down inflation.\nA labor market that continues to slow, but not dramatically, also likely keeps the Fed focused on inflation, which makes a less compelling case for aggressive rate cuts in 2025. An update on that narrative will come with the November jobs report, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nEconomists expect the report to show a reversal of the dismal October employment report that many believed was heavily impacted by hurricanes and worker strikes.\nThe November report is expected to show the US labor market added 200,000 jobs in the month, up from the 12,000 monthly job additions seen in October. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to have inched up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\"Through the monthly swings of nonfarm payrolls, we expect the November employment report to reiterate that while the labor market remains solid in an absolute sense, the softening trend in employment conditions has yet to cease,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients. \"That message is likely to come through more clearly from the unemployment rate, which we look to rise to 4.2%.\"\nStory Continues\n'Magnificent' earnings revisions\nWall Street strategists have been largely bullish when issuing 2025 forecasts, with strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance seeing the S&P 500 ending the year between 6,400 and 7,000. A frequent call in these outlooks has been for a continued broadening of the stock market rally away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 and toward the other 493 stocks in the index.\n\"We\u2019ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it\u2019s a close call,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote, emphasizing that another strong year of economic growth could help support the S&P 493.\nBut not everyone agrees. Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out that Big Tech continues to top earnings estimates each quarter. And as long as that streak continues, Krishna argued \"Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year.\"\nTo Krishna's point, while the broadening is expected to take place throughout next year, earnings revisions remain more positive for many Big Tech names than the rest of the S&P 500.\nIn a research note published on Nov. 27, DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe pointed out that six Big Tech companies have seen earnings revisions for the current quarter come in either flat or higher in the past 30 days. Only Microsoft and Apple have seen their earnings estimates cut more than the S&P 500's 1.2% estimate trim in that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500's 10 largest non-tech companies have seen earnings estimates slashed by an average of 2.7%.\n\"US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings,\" Rabe wrote. \"Fortunately, Big Tech makes up a third of the S&P, so their fundamentals have an outsized impact on the index.\"\nThe case for a strong December\nAnother popular call among strategists has been for the roaring bull market to continue through year-end, with more all-time highs in store before trading wraps up in 2024.\nAnd history supports that argument.\nCarson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that, in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 out of 10 times. Since 2000, the index has risen every December after a rally of this magnitude over the year's first 11 months.\n\"History says a chase into year-end is quite possible,\" Detrick wrote in a research note.\nWeekly Calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, November final (48.8 expected, 48.8 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, October (0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); ISM Manufacturing, November (47.6 expected, 46.5 previously); ISM prices paid, November (54.8 expected);\nEarnings: Zscaler (ZS)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: Job openings, October (7.51 million expected, 7.44 million previously);\nEarnings: Box (BOX), Marvell (MRVL), Okta (OKTA), Pure Storage (PSTG), Salesforce (CRM)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Nov. 29 (+6.3% previously); ADP Private Payrolls, November (+165,000 expected, +233,000 previously); S&P Global US Services PMI, November final (57 previously), S&P Global US Composite PMI, November final (55.3 previously); ISM Services index, November (55.5 expected, 56 previously); ISM Services prices paid, November (58.1 previously); Factory orders, October (0.3% expected, -0.5% previously); Durable goods orders, October final (+0.2% previously)\nEarnings: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Campbell's (CPB), ChargePoint (CHPT), Chewy (CHWY), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below (FIVE), Foot Locker (FL), Hormel Foods (HRL), RBC (RBC), Victoria's Secret (VSCO)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, November (+50.9% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Nov. 30 (213,000 previously)\nEarnings: BMO (BMO), Build-a-Bear Workshop (BBW), Dollar General (DG), DocuSign (DOCU), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Kroger (KR), Lululemon (LULU), Petco (WOOF), TD Bank (TD), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\nFriday\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, November (+200,000 expected, +12,000 previously); Unemployment rate, November (4.2% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+3.9% expected, +4% previously); Average weekly hours worked, November (34.3 expected, 34.3 previously); Labor force participation rate, November (62.6% previously)\nEarnings: BRP (DOOO)\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris\u2019s Fine Gael party is locked in a virtual dead heat with Sinn Fein in the general election, suggesting his decision to go to the country early didn\u2019t yield the advantage he predicted.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nRiyadh Metro Partially Opens in Bid to Ease City\u2019s Traffic Jams\nIn Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes\nFine Gael won 21% of first-preference votes in Friday\u2019s election, the official exit poll showed. Sinn Fein won 21.1%, while Fianna Fail, Fine Gael\u2019s coalition partner, was on 19.5.%. The poll had a margin of error of 1.4%.\nEven so, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail going back into government is still the most likely outcome \u2014 both have ruled out working with Sinn Fein. Almost half of respondents in the exit poll said they want the two centrist parties to lead another government. But a tight race is not ideal for Harris, especially if he emerges with less support than his rival.\nThe premier called the vote early \u2014 it wasn\u2019t due to be held until March \u2014 to try to capitalize on Fine Gael\u2019s surge in support since he became Taoiseach in April. It was dubbed the \u201cHarris hop\u201d in the media, and the 38-year-old made his campaign slogan \u201cnew energy,\u201d even though as a former health minister he was not new to government. A giveaway budget and what appeared to be a slide in support for Sinn Fein made it seem the optimal time to seek a new mandate.\nIt\u2019s a key moment. Whoever forms the next government will enjoy a budget surplus and soaring tax receipts from US firms including Apple Inc. operating there. What to do with Ireland\u2019s billions has been a key focus of the election, with parties competing on spending ideas \u2014 even as the re-election of Donald Trump in the US and his threat of trade tariffs injected a sense of caution.\nBut Harris\u2019s election campaign was beset with slip-ups, the worst a viral video of him walking away from a disability care worker and dismissing her view that the government wasn\u2019t doing enough. Harris later apologized.\nBased on the exit poll, Fine Gael\u2019s support has slumped significantly in recent weeks. An Irish Times survey in September \u2014 before the election announcement \u2014 showed Fine Gael at 27%, Sinn Fein at 20% and Fianna Fail at 19%.\nWorryingly for Harris, the exit poll also shows the premier trailing his two main rivals on the question of who should be next Taoiseach. Only 27% said they want the Fine Gael leader leading the country, while 35% said they would like Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin and 34% preferred Sinn Fein\u2019s Mary Lou McDonald.\nStory Continues\nMcDonald\u2019s strength comes from her support among young people, and that gels with the exit poll showing housing and homelessness were the biggest issues for voters, followed by the cost of living. Data published on election day showed homelessness in Ireland reached a record figure of almost 15,000.\nSinn Fein\u2019s rise under McDonald has shaken up Irish politics since she took over from Gerry Adams as president in 2018, its first leader unconnected to the era of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles. Its left-leaning economic agenda appealed to voters struggling with a housing shortage and rising inflation. At the start of the year, Sinn Fein was far ahead in the polls and appeared on course to form a government for the first time.\nBut it was also a roller-coaster year for Sinn Fein, which struggled to adapt its message to growing concerns in Ireland about rising immigration and the pressure it was putting on housing and public services. The party\u2019s lackluster performance in local and European votes in June played into Harris\u2019s thinking on the timing of the general election.\nThe exit poll suggests McDonald has stabilized Sinn Fein\u2019s support \u2014 with major implications for Irish politics. Fianna Fail and Fine Gael led every government since the state was formed 100 years ago, and while that looks set to continue, Sinn Fein\u2019s emergence as a third major party is changing the dynamic.\n\u201cThe wider picture here is that we\u2019re seeing further fragmentation within the Irish political system, across many smaller parties and indeed with many independents,\u201d Jack Chambers, finance minister and Fianna Fail\u2019s deputy leader, told RTE after the exit poll was released.\nFor now, a repeat of 2020 \u2014 when Sinn Fein narrowly won the popular vote but Fine Gael and Fianna Fail formed the government \u2014 still looks likely.\nYet the exit poll gives Harris plenty to worry about. Ireland\u2019s electoral system, a version of proportional representation with voters ranking preferred candidates, parties need to win 88 seats for a majority in the 174-seat Dail, or parliament. But no party fielded enough candidates to reach that threshold on its own, while the overall picture can change once second- and third-choice votes start to impact the makeup of parliament.\nThe risk for Harris is that Fianna Fail leapfrogs Fine Gael in seats. That, coupled with Harris polling lower than Martin personally, would likely affect who has the upper hand in coalition negotiations, which could take weeks.\nVote counting began at 9 a.m. on Saturday, with a clearer picture likely to emerge by the afternoon or later.\nIt\u2019s also not clear who Fine Gael and Fianna Fail would bring in to the coalition if, as expected, they fall short of a majority together. Their coalition partner last time, the Greens, are expected to have fewer seats this time.\nFor the two incumbent centrist parties, the support of a smaller center-left group would be ideal. According to the exit poll, the Social Democrats are on 5.8%, Labour at 5% and the Green Party at 4%.\nThe exit poll is based on over 5,000 interviews conducted immediately after people voted at polling stations across 43 constituencies across the country.\n(Updates with more details from exit poll from third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Billion-Dollar Railway Driving Biden\u2019s Africa Trip\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nWhat Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\nThe Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

But it\u2019s market cap sneaked above $1 trillion a few months ago without anyone noticing, and now it sits just beneath Tesla and above Taiwan Semiconductor.\nSo what gives? The deeper we delve into the bizarre Berkshire anomaly, the more remarkable it seems and the more valuable the explanations become. The company is literally in a class of its own. It isn\u2019t a tech company, but its market cap beats those of all other non-tech companies by such a vast margin that it doesn\u2019t seem to be one of them, either; its runner-up in that group, Walmart, would have to get 41% more valuable just to match Berkshire\u2019s market cap.\nAnother way to consider the magnitude of Berkshire\u2019s achievement: So far in this tech-infatuated year, Berkshire\u2019s stock has outperformed the shares of Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. It has beaten the tech-heavy Nasdaq as well as the S&P, the Dow, and the Russell 2000. It\u2019s hard to remember that CEO Warren Buffett told his shareholders last February, \u201cAll in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.\u201d\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nBut then performance can be measured in many ways, and market capitalization isn\u2019t Buffett\u2019s favorite way of evaluating a company. Market cap gauges the market\u2019s expectations, not measurable financial results, and as Buffett often notes, Mr. Market has mood swings. Buffett focuses instead on net worth as calculated by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The concept is simple: Add up a company\u2019s assets and then subtract its liabilities. What\u2019s left is net worth. Apple\u2019s net worth is $57 billion. Nvidia\u2019s is $66 billion. Berkshire\u2019s is $663 billion. Some of the other tech giants have a higher net worth than Apple and Nvidia have, but none reach even half of Berkshire\u2019s. As Buffett also told investors in February, \u201cBerkshire now has\u2014by far\u2014the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American business.\u201d\nStory Continues\nStudents of Berkshire might object that the company is more of a tech business than it appears to be, since it owns a lot of Apple stock. But the argument doesn\u2019t hold up. Berkshire owns several insurance companies (GEICO is best known) and invests customers\u2019 premiums in huge stock portfolios\u2014and Apple is its largest holding. But Berkshire has been offloading its Apple shares for almost a year, with about 70% of its holdings gone so far. That is, Berkshire stock has been rising as the company gets out of tech, dumping its Apple shares and collecting enormous gains.\nWhich brings us to the decades-old secret of Berkshire\u2019s breathtaking performance, highlighted by stock market events of the past year. It is, of course, no secret. It\u2019s Buffett, a fiercely independent, scorchingly intelligent CEO. He often seems serenely out of step with the world, as when he sells Apple stock into a rising market. Other business bromides he disdains:\n\u00b7 Everyone knows diversified conglomerates are a terrible idea. Decades of bountiful research have shown they underperform. But in 2015, Buffett told his shareholders, \u201cBerkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further\u2026. If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capital growth.\u201d The phrase \u201cused judiciously\u201d is his modest way of saying \u201cused as well as I use it.\u201d\n\u00b7 CEOs don\u2019t scorn their company\u2019s stock. But over the years Buffett has told shareholders when he thinks Berkshire shares are overpriced, and he warns them of potential trouble ahead, as he did again this year. Berkshire is always looking for companies to buy, but it has grown so big, he said, that \u201cthere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire,\u201d and for various reasons he isn\u2019t interested in buying them. Outside the U.S. \u201cthere are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options\u2026.\u201d That\u2019s why he said \u201ceye-popping performance\u201d won\u2019t be happening. Yet shareholders didn\u2019t run for the exits. Just the opposite. They trust him to find a way.\n\u00b7 Companies promote the products they sell by using them. Berkshire often does, but not always. It sells directors and officers insurance, which indemnifies board members against personal liability for their actions. But not at Berkshire. \u201cWe do not provide [board members] directors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company,\u201d Buffett said in his 2011 letter. \u201cIf they mess up with your money, they will lose their money as well.\u201d\nIt seems astounding that Buffett has somehow barged into the technology royals\u2019 jamboree, but it shouldn\u2019t be. He has been so fearlessly unconventional for so many years that very little should surprise us. If it were otherwise, Berkshire stock wouldn\u2019t have increased 4,384,748% under his 60 years of management.\nBuffett never ceases to amaze. This is just his latest mind-bender: A 94-year-old CEO joins the tech bros and in some ways outdoes them.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

Earlier this month, the DOJ asked the company to sell its Chrome browser and divest its Android mobile operating system.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) chair Lina Khan testifies before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on May 15, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) \u00b7 Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\nFollowing Trump's election win, investor optimism grew that these various antitrust threats would disappear under his administration. Some legal experts, however, are less confident, as Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reported.\nIves, for his part, sees the recent era in which regulators sought to limit Big Tech deals and scrutinize the world's largest companies as one that is coming to an end.\n\"We believe there will be major shifts in policy against Big Tech over the coming years with Trump in the White House and Khan out at the FTC ... we believe [it is] just a matter of time and will remove a huge thorn in the side of the tech world,\" Ives wrote.\nStory Continues\n\"As someone that has covered tech throughout the Microsoft vs. US Government trial/soap opera for many years in the 1990's into an ultimate win for Redmond, we believe negotiations and remedies will be much smaller than the fears for Google, Apple, MSFT, Meta and Big Tech.\"\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nLatest reports, published by MIT News, suggest that researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a more efficient algorithm, called Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), to improve AI decision-making in tasks like traffic control, which involves high variability. Reinforcement learning models, commonly used for AI decision-making, often fail when facing minor changes in their training tasks. MBTL strategically selects the most impactful tasks to train on, improving overall performance while reducing training costs.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nFor example, controlling traffic in a city involves numerous intersections with varying conditions. Instead of training separate algorithms for each intersection or one generalized algorithm for all, MBTL identifies and trains on a subset of key intersections. It leverages zero-shot transfer learning, allowing trained models to perform well on untrained, similar tasks. Per the report, this technique could revolutionize complex systems, reducing costs and improving AI reliability.

One of Fleet Street\u2019s longest-running share tip columns, it celebrates its 60th birthday on Dec 7.\nQuestor turns 60 this week, which makes us the same age as one of the most influential entrepreneurs of our time. Born to a teenage mum in New Mexico in 1964, Jeff Bezos came into this world the same year as scribes at The Telegraph first penned this column. The business he later founded, Amazon.com, much like this column, exists in a world awash with opportunity.\nSince Bezos established Amazon 30 years later in 1994, it has managed the incredible feat of positioning itself at the forefront of not one but two waves of profound technological change.\nThe US-listed company, whose shares can be bought through most British brokers, is best known for its dominance of e-commerce, especially in North America where it accounts for about two-fifths of online retail. Starting as an online book shop, Amazon has moved into ever more product areas, from electronics to fresh food, while opening its platform to third-party sellers, to which it offers a range of services.\nThere is still plenty of room for growth, with e-commerce currently representing just 16pc of retail in the US as it grows at a rate of nearly 9pc a year.\nThe very low profit margins associated with Amazon\u2019s retail operation \u2013 4.2pc in North America, while the smaller international division is loss-making \u2013 means the attractions are not immediately apparent. However, Bezos is well known for his laser focus on cash flows and a key allure is that Amazon receives payment from shoppers well before it pays suppliers. In 2023, across the entire group, money came in 29 days earlier than it went out.\nGiven Amazon\u2019s vast sales, it generates huge amounts of cash this way, which has helped finance prodigious growth. Group revenues have ballooned from $2.8bn in the first year of the millennium to a forecast $638bn for 2024. That\u2019s an increase of 20,481pc.\nAmazon has also been very successful finding extra income linked to core e-commerce activities, especially from advertising and subscriptions. These revenues have been growing faster than those of the main retail business and accounted for 15pc of the total in 2023. These not only represent higher-margin sales, but also boost loyalty of shoppers and third-party sellers.\nHowever, when it comes to high-margin earnings growth, it is the other industry Amazon dominates that offers the most exciting opportunities: cloud computing.\nStory continues\nThe company was early to embrace cloud computing with the launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, which, among other things, was done to free up its developers to focus on innovation. Today AWS is the leader in a rapidly growing market.\nThe business requires a lot of upfront investment to build data centres, but it is hugely profitable once these computing hubs are up and running. Last year AWS\u2019s operating margins came in at 27.1pc and it represented nearly two thirds of group profits despite accounting for only 15.8pc of sales.\nGrowth of AWS, along with that of higher-margin retail income streams, is forecast to lift overall group operating margins from 6.4pc last year to 12.6pc by 2026.\nAWS is forecast to grow at an annualised rate of 18.2pc for the next three years but rapid AI adoption could put extra wind in the sails. Amazon offers cloud customers a marketplace of AI models, designs its own AI chips, and this month announced a second $4bn investment in Anthropic, a key rival to the Microsoft-backed ChatGPT.\nRecent trading suggests AWS\u2019s biggest challenge is keeping up with demand. Meanwhile, the retail business is benefiting from more budget-conscious shopping. Brokers have upgraded 2025 earnings forecasts by 7pc in the last month alone and by 27pc over the last year.\nValued at 34 times forecast next-year earnings, the shares may be near their lowest rating of the decade, but on the surface still look pricey. However, growth and improving profitability means the valuation is expected to fall rapidly, to just over 20 times three years hence.\nIt is also incredibly popular with the world\u2019s best fund managers, 20 of which \u2013 all among the top 3pc of managers tracked by financial publisher Citywire \u2013 have above-benchmark positions in the shares. This means Amazon holds a top AAA Citywire Elite Companies rating based on the level of smart money backing.\nWhile emboldened regulators around the globe are a risk for Amazon \u2013 given the strong cashflows, growth prospects and rising margins \u2013 we can see why so many top managers want to back it at the price.\nQuestor says: Buy\nTicker: NYSE:AMZN\nShare price: $207.89\nRead the latest Questor column on telegraph.co.uk every weekday at 5am.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced new generative AI enhancements for Amazon Connect, AWS\u2019s cloud contact center solution. These new features will further improve customer experiences by enabling more personalized, efficient, and proactive customer service. As a result, organizations can help significantly improve customer satisfaction through faster issue resolution and continuous contact center optimization, while simultaneously reducing operational costs.\nAmazon Connect now offers automated segmentation for proactive outreach, delivering personalized and timely interactions across communication channels for a single person or groups with similar characteristics.\nAmazon Q in Connect, a generative AI-powered assistant for customer service, now enables organizations to create relevant, automated, and dynamic self-service experiences.\nAmazon Q in Connect features new customizable AI guardrails with robust controls over AI-generated content, enabling organizations to confidently deploy generative AI in contact centers while adhering to their specific policies and safeguarding customer interactions.\nNew AI-powered agent evaluations and intelligent contact categorization tools enable customer service managers to easily spot performance trends, enhance training, and help improve overall service quality.\nTens of thousands of AWS customers use Amazon Connect to support more than 10 million contact center interactions every day. Frontdoor, Fujitsu, GoStudent, Priceline, Pronetx, and University of Auckland are among customers and partners using the new generative AI enhancements for Amazon Connect to deliver superior customer service at a lower cost.\n\"With Amazon Connect, in addition to evolving customer service, we\u2019re also fundamentally reimagining how organizations build, nurture, and sustain customer relationships,\" said Pasquale DeMaio, vice president and general manager of Amazon Connect at AWS. \"By using generative AI to improve the customer experience, Amazon Connect is paving the way for a future where every customer interaction is an opportunity to delight and foster long-term loyalty. The continuous evolution of Amazon Q in Connect is giving organizations the power and flexibility needed to handle sophisticated customer service scenarios without requiring programming expertise.\"\nStory Continues\nStrengthen customer loyalty with more personalized experiences powered by generative AI\nOrganizations often struggle to deliver relevant customer experiences due to fragmented data across disparate systems, including separate databases for purchases, support tickets, and online interactions. This fragmentation prevents them from gaining a holistic view of their customers' journey, while also limiting their ability to launch specialized campaigns and initiate proactive outbound communications based on real-time customer events. As a result, organizations miss crucial opportunities to engage customers at just the right moments in their journey, whether through timely support, relevant offers, or proactive communication. This leads to diminished customer satisfaction and reduced loyalty, as organizations find themselves unable to meet the growing expectations of customers who anticipate seamless, relevant interactions.\nAmazon Connect helps solve these problems by bridging data silos, creating a unified view of each customer that organizations can use for proactively addressing needs before issues arise and conducting outbound campaigns. Now, Amazon Connect\u2019s generative AI-powered segmentation capabilities can analyze data to provide smart recommendations on engaging different groups of customers based on both real-time and historical interactions, offering a comprehensive view of customer interactions and preferences. For example, an airline might use Amazon Connect to identify frequent flyers experiencing a significant delay, then automatically offer them priority rebooking options, lounge access, or personalized compensation based on their loyalty status and past travel patterns. Amazon Connect simplifies the process of defining meaningful customer segments and delivering relevant outbound campaigns by consolidating customer journey insights from various touchpoints. Campaign managers can then use simple, conversational commands to define segments based on this rich data. This approach enables organizations to craft precisely timed incoming and outgoing communications that respond to real-time interests and events, resulting in more personalized experiences that improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nGoStudent, a leading tutorial and education technology provider, uses Amazon Connect to ensure customer call-backs are routed to the right sales representative based on previous contact history. By leveraging Amazon Connect's enhanced unified customer profiles and outbound campaign capabilities, GoStudent will expand its sales strategy to include proactive outreach alongside existing inbound operations. This combined approach is expected to increase sales representatives' daily contacts by 20% and accelerate lead-to-customer conversions.\nCreate generative AI-powered self-service experiences with Amazon Q in Connect\nConsumers expect increasingly personalized, faster, and capable self-service support. Generative AI offers a promising solution to meet these expectations; however, integrating it into a contact center environment requires significant investment in multiple third-party services, infrastructure, and specialized talent. During implementation, organizations must develop custom safeguards to regulate AI-generated responses. Without proper controls, generative AI may provide inappropriate information to customers, surface information that does not resolve customer issues, or frustrate customers by asking them for the same information multiple times. Consequently, many organizations hesitate to fully embrace generative AI, missing out on potential improvements in customer experience and contact center efficiency gains.\nAmazon Q in Connect now features generative AI-powered capabilities to enhance self-service customer service, offering customers the same personalized responses, proactive actions, and contextual understanding it provides to agents. Organizations can quickly create, test, and improve AI-powered self-service experiences across chat and voice channels that provide tailored responses and take proactive actions. For example, when a customer asks what rebooking options are available for their flight, Amazon Connect accesses and analyzes the customer's specific information before formulating a response. This includes checking the customer's airline status (e.g., frequent flyer level), reviewing the current ticket class, and examining eligibility based on the airline's policies. Amazon Connect then uses this data to provide a tailored response, offering rebooking options that align with the customer's status, preferences, and eligibility. If appropriate and within policy guidelines, it can proceed to book a new ticket. Amazon Connect also ensures smooth handoffs to a customer service agent, when needed, by automatically transferring the conversation, providing a comprehensive summary of the interaction, sharing all relevant customer data and context gathered, and enabling the agent to continue the conversation seamlessly without requiring the customer to repeat information.\nTo enhance the safety and reliability of generative AI deployments in contact centers, Amazon Q in Connect now includes customizable AI guardrails. These safeguards provide organizations with robust controls over AI-generated responses without the need for extensive prompt engineering. Organizations can block undesirable topics for self-service, filter harmful and inappropriate content based on their responsible AI policies, redact sensitive information to protect customer privacy, and verify model responses using contextual grounding checks. These safeguards can be selectively applied based on contact type, offering flexible control over AI interactions. By integrating these features into Amazon Q in Connect, Amazon reduces the complexity and cost associated with building custom generative AI virtual agents, while empowering organizations to confidently leverage AI in their contact centers in alignment with their unique requirements.\nFrontdoor, a leading provider of home warranties and digital on-demand services, is piloting Amazon Q in Connect with the intent of reducing agent training and on-boarding time. This pilot is already reducing an agent\u2019s path to proficiency by delivering agents\u2019 next best responses and actions, based on policy documents stored in Amazon S3 within the Amazon Connect agent workspace. As they learn from how agents use this technology, Frontdoor expects to expand this same support to consumer-facing, self-service interactions.\nPronetx, a professional services partner for customer experience transformation, is implementing Amazon Q in Connect for a number of public sector, federal, and financial technology organizations. With Amazon Q in Connect, they have the ability to use a single engine to drive both customer-facing conversational self-service experiences and context-aware suggestions and automations for representatives. Pronetx expects Amazon Q in Connect will allow the public sector, federal, and financial technology organizations they support to focus on creating the experiences that matter most to their customers while empowering their representatives with the best decision-making information and guidance at the right time in every customer touchpoint.\nEmpower contact center managers with generative AI-driven insights\nContact center managers face significant challenges in managing customer journeys and engagement across digital and agent interactions at scale. Traditional methods of evaluating agent performance are often time-consuming and limited in scope, typically allowing managers to assess only 1%-2% of all customer interactions. This limitation makes it difficult to provide timely and comprehensive feedback, potentially introducing bias and reducing visibility into overall performance. Managers also struggle to efficiently categorize and analyze customer contacts, hindering their ability to identify trends, spot areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experiences. Without effective tools to automatically flag critical issues such as customer discontent or requests for escalation, managers often miss opportunities to address emerging problems promptly. These limitations impede an organization's ability to be more agile and adaptive in getting ahead of external and business condition changes that impact the customer experience.\nTo address these challenges, Amazon Connect has new enhancements that help contact center managers quickly spot important trends in customer feedback and identify agent coaching insights. Managers now have tools to automatically complete 100% of agent performance evaluations against defined quality standards, aided by conversational analytics and screen recording capabilities. Managers can automatically perform and complete evaluations, access aggregated agent performance data, identify specific coaching opportunities, and help their teams develop and grow. These improvements collectively contribute to the continuous enhancement of the customer journey. For example, managers will automatically be able to identify behavioral coaching opportunities on all customer interactions, like \"interaction lacked empathy while delivering bad news to the customer.\" Amazon Connect also uses generative AI to enable managers to easily categorize contacts. Through natural language prompts, managers can automatically categorize contacts to understand call trends over time, flag calls indicating customer discontent, learn about communication breakdowns during calls, discover agent performance improvement opportunities, and more. As a result, organizations can train their staff more effectively, identify and address common customer issues faster, and improve overall customer experiences.\nFujitsu, a global digital transformation partner based in Japan, has collaborated with AWS to develop a generative AI-powered approach to quality assurance (QA). Traditionally, Fujitsu's QA process could only review 4% of voice interactions and 0.5% of chat interactions. However, with Amazon Connect, Fujitsu's service desks can now auto-score 100% of interactions across both voice and chat channels without increasing human effort. This advancement allows managers to focus on higher-level strategic initiatives and enhances QA efficiency by 60%, transforming Fujitsu's QA process into a real-time, high-sample, and unbiased approach without requiring additional QA resources.\nPriceline, an online travel agency offering a wide range of travel-related services, uses Amazon Connect to analyze customer interactions quickly, zeroing in on problems and areas to improve the customer experience. With Amazon Connect's generative AI-powered agent performance evaluations and call summary, Priceline expects to reduce the time managers spend evaluating customer interactions. Priceline's managers have expressed enthusiasm for the system's ability to provide rich context in review notes.\nUniversity of Auckland, a public research university in New Zealand, uses generative AI-powered automated evaluations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their quality assurance process. Since implementing this feature of Amazon Connect, the university's team of 50 staff were able to focus more on targeted feedback and coaching rather than manual reviews. This shift is significantly improving their student support services while reducing staff training time and enhancing overall service delivery. Importantly, the new system is saving the university up to 10 hours per week on the QA process, time which can now be redirected towards other pressing tasks, further boosting productivity and service quality.\nAll of these features are generally available today.

But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Amazon.com\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\nWhat Is Amazon.com Worth?\nGreat news for investors \u2013 Amazon.com is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $318.79, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Amazon.com\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nWhat kind of growth will Amazon.com generate?\nNasdaqGS:AMZN Earnings and Revenue Growth December 1st 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Amazon.com's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 87%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? Since AMZN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AMZN for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy AMZN.

          "whole_article": "Stocks will enter the final month of 2024 near record highs as investors look to cap off what's been another stellar year for US stocks.\nDuring last week's holiday-shortened trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 2%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended November at all-time highs.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's November jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also scatter the schedule.\nInvestors will look to this week's economic data for clarity on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, which will be announced on Dec. 18.\nIn corporate news, earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Okta (OKTA), and Lululemon (LULU) will highlight the coming week's schedule.\n\u2022 USD\n(^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA labor look-in\nExpectations for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have shifted in recent months.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a 66% chance the Fed cuts rates at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But looking out further, markets are pricing in just two more rate cuts over the next year, with concerns growing about the Fed's progress on bringing down inflation.\nA labor market that continues to slow, but not dramatically, also likely keeps the Fed focused on inflation, which makes a less compelling case for aggressive rate cuts in 2025. An update on that narrative will come with the November jobs report, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nEconomists expect the report to show a reversal of the dismal October employment report that many believed was heavily impacted by hurricanes and worker strikes.\nThe November report is expected to show the US labor market added 200,000 jobs in the month, up from the 12,000 monthly job additions seen in October. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to have inched up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\"Through the monthly swings of nonfarm payrolls, we expect the November employment report to reiterate that while the labor market remains solid in an absolute sense, the softening trend in employment conditions has yet to cease,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients. \"That message is likely to come through more clearly from the unemployment rate, which we look to rise to 4.2%.\"\nStory Continues\n'Magnificent' earnings revisions\nWall Street strategists have been largely bullish when issuing 2025 forecasts, with strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance seeing the S&P 500 ending the year between 6,400 and 7,000. A frequent call in these outlooks has been for a continued broadening of the stock market rally away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 and toward the other 493 stocks in the index.\n\"We\u2019ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it\u2019s a close call,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote, emphasizing that another strong year of economic growth could help support the S&P 493.\nBut not everyone agrees. Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out that Big Tech continues to top earnings estimates each quarter. And as long as that streak continues, Krishna argued \"Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year.\"\nTo Krishna's point, while the broadening is expected to take place throughout next year, earnings revisions remain more positive for many Big Tech names than the rest of the S&P 500.\nIn a research note published on Nov. 27, DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe pointed out that six Big Tech companies have seen earnings revisions for the current quarter come in either flat or higher in the past 30 days. Only Microsoft and Apple have seen their earnings estimates cut more than the S&P 500's 1.2% estimate trim in that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500's 10 largest non-tech companies have seen earnings estimates slashed by an average of 2.7%.\n\"US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings,\" Rabe wrote. \"Fortunately, Big Tech makes up a third of the S&P, so their fundamentals have an outsized impact on the index.\"\nThe case for a strong December\nAnother popular call among strategists has been for the roaring bull market to continue through year-end, with more all-time highs in store before trading wraps up in 2024.\nAnd history supports that argument.\nCarson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that, in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 out of 10 times. Since 2000, the index has risen every December after a rally of this magnitude over the year's first 11 months.\n\"History says a chase into year-end is quite possible,\" Detrick wrote in a research note.\nWeekly Calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, November final (48.8 expected, 48.8 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, October (0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); ISM Manufacturing, November (47.6 expected, 46.5 previously); ISM prices paid, November (54.8 expected);\nEarnings: Zscaler (ZS)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: Job openings, October (7.51 million expected, 7.44 million previously);\nEarnings: Box (BOX), Marvell (MRVL), Okta (OKTA), Pure Storage (PSTG), Salesforce (CRM)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Nov. 29 (+6.3% previously); ADP Private Payrolls, November (+165,000 expected, +233,000 previously); S&P Global US Services PMI, November final (57 previously), S&P Global US Composite PMI, November final (55.3 previously); ISM Services index, November (55.5 expected, 56 previously); ISM Services prices paid, November (58.1 previously); Factory orders, October (0.3% expected, -0.5% previously); Durable goods orders, October final (+0.2% previously)\nEarnings: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Campbell's (CPB), ChargePoint (CHPT), Chewy (CHWY), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below (FIVE), Foot Locker (FL), Hormel Foods (HRL), RBC (RBC), Victoria's Secret (VSCO)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, November (+50.9% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Nov. 30 (213,000 previously)\nEarnings: BMO (BMO), Build-a-Bear Workshop (BBW), Dollar General (DG), DocuSign (DOCU), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Kroger (KR), Lululemon (LULU), Petco (WOOF), TD Bank (TD), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\nFriday\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, November (+200,000 expected, +12,000 previously); Unemployment rate, November (4.2% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+3.9% expected, +4% previously); Average weekly hours worked, November (34.3 expected, 34.3 previously); Labor force participation rate, November (62.6% previously)\nEarnings: BRP (DOOO)\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Revenues reached $158.9 billion, marking an 11% growth compared to the previous year, while operating income reached a record $17.4 billion, surging 56% year over year.\nWhy Amazon (AMZN) Stock Jumped 10% in One Month\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\nMeanwhile, its profit jumped more than 50% to over $17 billion in the third quarter, and its 11% operating margin came in above Wall Street\u2019s expectations of just over 9%. CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s bullish comments about the company\u2019s AI business further fueled investor optimism. AWS reported a 19% increase in sales to $27.5 billion, the quickest pace of growth in seven quarters for the cloud business.\nMoreover, Amazon is fully reaping the benefits of the shopping season. Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster notes how Amazon\u2019s shift in focus from Cyber Monday to Black Friday has proven effective for the business. By making a move that aligns with Amazon\u2019s tradition of creating its own sales events, such as Prime Day, Munster estimates that it has improved retail operating margins from -3% two years ago to +5% this quarter. This profitability could grow to 7% in 2025, significantly boosting earnings per share.\nAccording to Adobe, consumers spent a record $6.1 billion online on Thanksgiving, up 8.8%. Moreover, Amazon started offering Black Friday discounts starting Nov. 21, eight days early. Wedbush Securities analysts stated that the short shopping window would give Amazon an advantage over other online retailers, given its speedy delivery times.\nAmazon has also invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic, underscoring its commitment to advancing generative AI technologies and solidifying its leadership in tech innovation. All in all, the holiday season has proved to be a game-changer for the stock, and analysts have also been raising price targets and predicting continued growth. A top analyst at JPMorgan Chase even highlighted that E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) is investors' best bet for the year-end holidays.\nStory Continues\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

While I remain bullish on both investments, my preference is heavily skewed toward buying Microsoft over Meta at this time.\nDon't Miss our Black Friday Offers:\nUnlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF!\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\nMeta Has Been Stealthily Winning the AI Arms Race\nI\u2019m bullish on Meta, which has been investing heavily in AI, committing a substantial $35 billion to the technology in 2024 alone. The company is leveraging its vast ecosystem of apps\u2014including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger\u2014to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities. For instance, the introduction of Meta AI, an assistant built on its Llama 3 language model, has reached 500 million users within just seven months.\nIn addition to its aggressive AI investments, Meta has differentiated itself by open-sourcing its AI models, such as Llama 3. While competitors like OpenAI and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) typically keep their models proprietary, Meta\u2019s open-source strategy fosters innovation and collaboration, enabling other technology companies and developers to test and improve its models.\nMoreover, Meta is a leader in AI model transparency. It has developed methodologies to make AI decision-making processes fully interpretable, addressing the \u201cblack box\u201d problem in AI. By pioneering transparency and accountability, Meta is positioning itself as a responsible leader in the AI industry\u2014a critical advantage as AI adoption expands into high-stakes fields such as healthcare and finance.\nMETA Stock\u2019s Valuation\nMeta\u2019s rise in AI, though initially unexpected, is now firmly on the radar of technology investors. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the company is trading near all-time highs. However, what should it be trading at? To value the firm, I first estimate Meta\u2019s full-year 2034 EBITDA at $278.65 billion. Assuming a conservative EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 12.3, reflecting slower growth expectations compared to recent years, Meta\u2019s December 2034 enterprise value would be $3.43 trillion.\nWith a median weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of approximately 8.5% over the past decade, I then discount this forecasted enterprise value back to December 2024, arriving at an intrinsic value of $1.52 trillion. As Meta\u2019s current enterprise value is $1.41 trillion, this implies a modest 7.6% margin of safety for investors.\nStory Continues\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About Meta?\nMeta currently holds a Strong Buy consensus rating on Wall Street, with an average META price target of $662.62, implying 15.4% upside potential. This is based on 40 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell, further supporting my view that Meta is a viable investment option.\nSee more META analyst ratings\nMicrosoft Is Dominating in AI and Is Undervalued\nI\u2019m also highly bullish on Microsoft, which has a commanding presence in cloud-based AI, particularly through its Azure platform. It leads in traditional AI and generative AI adoption, boasting the highest number of new AI customers and generative AI users compared to peers AWS (AMZN) and Google. Microsoft\u2019s leadership is reinforced by its partnership with OpenAI, which has enabled seamless integration of cutting-edge AI technologies into its cloud services.\nUnlike Meta, Microsoft has a clear and direct monetization pathway for its AI capabilities. The company has integrated AI across its product suite, enhancing user experiences with tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is now used by nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies.\nMicrosoft also prioritizes ethical and transparent AI, which is crucial for its focus on high-impact sectors such as healthcare. Its advancements in multimodal medical imaging and AI-driven nursing workflow solutions are significantly improving patient care. Furthermore, Microsoft\u2019s AI initiatives extend into finance, customer service, and defense, as seen through its collaboration with Palantir (PLTR) on AI solutions for Western defense.\nMSFT Stock\u2019s Valuation\nTo value Microsoft, I first estimate its December 2034 EBITDA at $616.8 billion. Applying a conservative EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 20.3\u2014aligned with the midpoint of its 10-year median and five-year average\u2014my forecast for Microsoft\u2019s enterprise value by December 2034 is $12.52 trillion.\nFurthermore, Microsoft\u2019s WACC stands at 9.81%, with equity making up 97.64% and debt accounting for 2.36%. After discounting my December 2034 forecast back to December 2024, I calculate an intrinsic enterprise value of $4.91 trillion. Given Microsoft\u2019s current enterprise value of $3.13 trillion, this represents a substantial 56.91% margin of safety for investors.\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About Microsoft?\nMicrosoft also has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Wall Street, with an average MSFT price target of $496.92, implying 17.35% upside potential. This rating is supported by 26 Buys, three Holds, and no Sells, reinforcing my thesis that Microsoft is an attractive investment opportunity.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nConclusion: Microsoft Is the Better Investment\nWhile both Meta and Microsoft are poised for substantial long-term growth driven by their strategic positions in AI, Microsoft offers the better investment opportunity today due to its superior valuation and monetization strategy. Even if Meta succeeds in developing the most advanced AI models, its ability to monetize these capabilities may be more challenging compared to Microsoft\u2019s established pathways. Given the security and stability that Microsoft provides, I favor buying its stock while holding off on Meta for now.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks analysts are monitoring.\nOpenAI of ChatGPT fame has emerged as the poster child of the AI revolution. The AI models behind the famous AI assistant have, however, started to attract unwanted attention in recent months. For example, news publication The Guardian has reported that a group of major news organizations in Canada have sued the AI firm for allegedly strip-mining journalism and unjustly enriching itself by using news articles to train the popular ChatGPT software. Per the report, the suit was filed in the superior court of justice in Ontario and calls for punitive damages, a share of profits made by OpenAI from using the articles, and an injunction barring the San Francisco-based company from using any of the news articles in the future.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOpenAI has faced similar suits in recent months but has managed to fight back without incurring financial harm. The latest suit, per the report, includes news platforms like the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Press, the CBC, the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, and Postmedia. The companies want up to C$20,000 in damages for each article used by OpenAI, suggesting a victory in court could be worth billions. As it battles these claims, OpenAI has already signed licensing agreements with a handful of media organizations, including the Associated Press wire service, NewsCorp and Cond\u00e9 Nast.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:MGNI) stands against the other best Adtech stocks to buy.\nAs per Dimension Market Research, the Global\u00a0AdTech market\u00a0size touched\u00a0US$1,066.8 billion in 2023\u00a0and should reach US$3,528.4 billion by 2032. The market is expected to compound at ~14.2% from 2024 to 2032.\u00a0Some of the critical trends include a strong emphasis on privacy-centric advertising, growth fueled by AI-driven personalization, and dominance of video and mobile advertising.\nKey Trends Defining the AdTech Market\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning continue to drive sophisticated audience segmentation and personalized ad experiences. As per Geomotiv, a software development company, these technologies can quickly analyze vast amounts of data, predict user behavior, and tailor ads in real time. Collectively, these features help to improve engagement and conversion rates. The benefits of personalization and the opportunities provided should drive the demand for these solutions and the growth of AI-oriented AdTech companies.\nMarket experts believe that advertisers continue to target Programmatic advertising. This space continues to expand beyond traditional digital channels. Adnimation, a software company, highlighted that CTV ad spending is expected to grow to\u00a0$42.4 billion by 2027\u00a0in the US. Publishers that have video content should prioritize CTV and\u00a0find for best supply-side platform (SSP)\u00a0to tap into a rapidly growing market.\nAdvertisers have been leveraging programmatic to reach the audiences with targeted ads. Furthermore, programmatic continues to make inroads into the audio format, such as podcasts and music streaming services. Next, AdTech SaaS companies have been providing customizable solutions, which enable advertisers to tailor the tools and features as per the specific needs. The popularity of these products continues to grow among advertisers and publishers.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\nBlockchain and\u00a0Influencer Marketing Should Drive Growth\nAs per Adnimation, data-driven influencer marketing is expected to dominate the broader AdTech market. Furthermore, the publishers and their AdTech counterparts continue collaborating with micro-influencers to fuel engagement and conversions. \u00a0Blockchain technology should also be key in ensuring transparency in digital ad transactions. By decentralizing ad transactions, blockchain can help reduce ad fraud, improve trust between publishers and advertisers, and enable accurate tracking of ad performance. This will result in more reliable revenue streams. Adnimation also believes that, by 2025, video is expected to dominate digital ad formats, making up\u00a082% of all internet traffic.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo list the 11 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we scanned through online rankings and AdTech-focused ETFs.

Wall Street believes that Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s expertise lies in connected TV (CTV), which remains the fastest-growing segment of digital advertising. The optimism around the company further strengthened when it got selected as the partner to power the Netflix ad-supported tier sale. The collaboration is expected to have a substantial impact on Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s future revenues.\nBofA Securities\u00a0analyst Omar Dessouky\u00a0believes that the Netflix partnership should result in a $30-million revenue run rate by 2025 end.\u00a0 Furthermore, the analyst believes that the Netflix partnership should be able to contribute $44 million/$69 million/$199 million\u00a0to Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s revenue in 2026, 2027, and 2028. Industry experts believe that Netflix should become the company\u2019s largest CTV customer, which should help it offset any weakness from other partnerships.\nAs Netflix's ad-supported tier grows, Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) is expected to see improved revenue without proportional increases in costs.

          "whole_article": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Roku (ROKU). Shares have added about 5.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Roku due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nROKU Q3 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Revenues Increase Y/Y\nRoku reported third-quarter 2024 loss of 6 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents. The company had incurred a loss of $2.33 per share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues increased 16.47% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to $1.062 billion and beat the consensus mark by 4.37%. Growth of The Roku Channel\u2019s streaming households and streaming hours drove third-quarter performance. Roku\u2019s streaming households and streaming hours grew 13% and 20%, respectively, year over year.\n\nStreaming Households were 85.5 million, representing a net increase of 2 million from the second quarter of 2024. The Roku Home Screen, which is the beginning of viewers\u2019 streaming experience, reaches U.S. households with more than 120 million people every day, reflecting greater engagement and more monetization opportunities.\n\nThe Roku operating system (OS) was again the #1 selling TV OS in the United States, with TV unit sales greater than the next two TV operating systems combined. The Roku OS was also the #1 selling TV OS in Mexico and Canada.\n\nGlobally, users streamed a record 32 billion hours in the third quarter, up 20% hours from the prior quarter.\n\nThe average revenue per user remained flat year over year at $41.1 (on a trailing 12-month basis).\n\nThe Roku Channel remained the #3 app on Roku\u2019s platform in the third quarter by both reach and engagement, with Streaming Hours up nearly 80% year over year. This ongoing growth is largely due to the company\u2019s position as the lead-in to TV and Home Screen\u2019s power to drive viewership. The Roku Channel\u2019s Nielsens\u2019 The Gauge hit an all-time high ranking for August 2024, representing 4.1% of total TV streaming time in the United States. Roku launched Roku Sports Channel in August providing viewers with free sports content. Good Morning Football: Overtime, a new extension series of NFL Network\u2019s long-running Good Morning Football was also added to the Roku Channel.\nQuarter Details\nPlatform revenues (85.5% of revenues) increased 15.43% year over year to $908.2 million, driven by contributions from streaming services distribution and advertising activities, despite continued softness within the media and entertainment vertical.\n\nDevices revenues (14.5% of revenues) rose 23% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to $154 million.\nStory Continues\nOperating Details\nGross margin, as a percentage of total revenues, expanded 476 basis points from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to 45.2%.\n\nOperating expenses decreased 28.22% year over year to $515.83 million. As a percentage of total revenues, the metric contracted to 48.56% from 78.79% reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nResearch & development and sales & marketing expenses decreased 36.64% and 22.96% on a year-over-year basis to $178.79 million and $237.04 million, respectively. General & administrative expenses increased 22.3% to $99.9 million.\n\nIn the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $98.2 million against adjusted EBITDA of $43.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Roku reported the fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and trailing 12-month free cash flow.\n\nOperating loss was $35.8 million in the reported quarter compared with an operating loss of $349.8 million in the year-ago quarter.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $2.12 billion compared with $2.05 billion as of June 30, 2024. As of Sept 30, 2024, Roku had no long-term debt.\nGuidance\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, ROKU expects total net revenues of $1.14 billion, total gross profit of roughly $465 million and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.\nVGM Scores\nCurrently, Roku has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nRoku has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\nPerformance of an Industry Player\nRoku is part of the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry. Over the past month, Netflix (NFLX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 16.1%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2024 more than a month ago.\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of B.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Find out when Sabrina Carpenter hosts a holiday variety music special that streams on Netflix starting Friday, Dec. 6. \u201cIt\u2019s an hour of literal nonsense,\u201d Sabrina told Time magazine about the special. \u201cIf people are expecting boring, me singing by a tree, it\u2019s not that.

Knightley joked to The Associated Press that the show falls in the \u201cDie Hard\u201d category of holiday entertainment. \u201cIt\u2019s like, I\u2019ve spent too much time with my family. I hate them all. I need to watch something blow up!\u201d \u201cBlack Doves\u201d debuts Thursday on the streamer.\n\u2014 Margo Martindale stars in the new Prime Video series \u201cThe Sticky,\u201d as a down-on-her-luck woman on the brink of financial ruin who finds herself in a crime ring stealing, of all things, millions of dollars\u2019 worth of maple syrup.

It premieres Friday, Dec. 6.\n\u2014 Alicia Rancilio\nNEW VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY\n\u2014 Multiplayer free-for-alls like Overwatch and Apex Legends remain popular online, but it\u2019s been years since a new release has made an impact. Chinese-owned NetEase Games is hoping to shake up the genre by adding superheroes and villains to the formula with Marvel Rivals. The core competition is a battle between two teams of six heroes each. The initial lineup includes marquee names like Spider-Man, Black Panther and Captain America as well as a few cult favorites like Luna Snow and Jeff the Land Shark. Some characters \u2014 say Thor, Loki and Hela \u2014 can join forces to unleash all sorts of havoc. It\u2019s all free-to-play, and the mayhem begins Friday, Dec. 6, on PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.\n\u2014 Lou Kesten\nView Comments"

By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nOver half a decade, Netflix managed to grow its earnings per share at 41% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 23% over the same period.

          "whole_article": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - Netflix won the dismissal on Tuesday of a shareholder lawsuit accusing the streaming company of downplaying the impact on subscriber growth of account sharing, where paying members share user names and passwords with nonpaying members in other households.\nThe proposed class action led by a Texas-based trustee began after Netflix revealed in April 2022 it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the prior quarter, the first decline in a decade, and might lose 2 million more in the next three months.\nNetflix blamed the decline on several factors, including account sharing, rising competition and a shutdown of service in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Its shares fell 35% the next day, wiping out more than $54 billion of market value.\nU.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in Oakland, California, however, said Netflix's earlier claims to be \"roughly 60% penetrated\" in the United States and Canada with \"a lot of headroom\" to grow were not false or misleading, because they referred to paid subscribers and did not imply that growth was certain.\nHe also found no proof Netflix concealed any determination that account sharing would severely hinder growth.\n\"At most,\" he said, the plaintiff's allegations suggest that the Los Gatos, California-based company investigated account sharing and found it to be \"one potential threat to growth among many.\"\nLawyers for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Netflix and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.\nTigar had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit in January. Tuesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, the trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, cannot amend his complaint again.\nThe case is Pirani v Netflix Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-02672. (This story has been refiled to change the location of the judge to Oakland, California, from San Francisco, in paragraph 4)\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in December.\nJared Cohen, Goldman Sachs president of global affairs, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that amid rising data center-driven energy demand because of AI, the US would need to collaborate with other countries via \u201cdiplomacy.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at data centers for cloud workloads versus data centers for AI workloads, data centers for AI workloads require ultra-high density. They need a concentrated power source, and so intermittent power like wind and solar doesn\u2019t fit the bill. You need base load power, so I think nuclear, coal, and natural gas are necessary, and we have plenty of that in the US. The problem is we can\u2019t transport it from where it is through multiple jurisdictions because of the \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 issue. So, the US is going to need some kind of overflow option if it wants to continue leading in this space. There\u2019s not a single geography that I would say represents a panacea to this problem.\u201d\nAnswering a question about whether the return to relatively cheaper and reliable energy sources like coal could satisfy the AI-driven energy demand, the analyst said the US would still need to look beyond just relying on its own sources because the need for power is huge.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to probably bring another 35-plus gigawatts of power online relative to the 17 gigawatts of power that are already online feeding these data centers in just the next couple of years. That\u2019s not enough, that\u2019s not enough time. So, you know, the US is going to continue to lead in the space, but it\u2019s not going to be able to lead on its own.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are getting investors\u2019 attention on the back of latest news. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nDean of Valuation Aswath Damodaran on Nvidia (NVDA): \u2018It\u2019s Going to be Painful\u2019\nPixabay/Public Domain\nStory Continues\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 193\nAswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance, recently talked about Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in a program on CNBC and said:\n\u201cInvestors are also increasingly focused on the guidance that Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is offering, and the negative reaction, I think, is coming from the sobering of that guidance. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), I believe, is trying to bring investors down for a soft landing, lowering expectations. However, it\u2019s going to be painful. Every earnings report, you\u2019re likely to see more of this phenomenon play out\u2014where they beat the numbers but the stock price still goes down.\u201d\nDamodaran explained exactly why he believes Nvidia\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is overvalued.\n\u201cI think at this price, if you\u2019re buying, you\u2019re expecting the product and service market to be much bigger than people anticipate. You need to be clear that this is what you\u2019re basing your purchase on. Even if you assume Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI chip market\u2014which I believe they currently have\u2014and their ability to maintain these sky-high margins, you still can\u2019t justify a $144 valuation without something additional happening. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re betting on Nvidia finding and dominating another market, and that\u2019s a tough call.\u201d\nSimply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia\u2019s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers \u2014 which account for 50% of its revenue \u2014 are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn a reversal from the past two quarters,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in December. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Louis Navellier's Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Louis Navellier's other stock picks.\nLouis Navellier, Chairman and Founder of Navellier & Associates, is a renowned American investor who is celebrated for his skill in navigating the stock market and delivering impressive profits. Leading a firm dedicated to growth investments, Navellier\u2019s strategy is reflected in his high-performing portfolio. His journey began in a college mainframe computer lab in the 1970s. While studying at the now Cal State East Bay, Navellier set out to validate the prevailing belief that beating the market was impossible. His original aim was to create an index product before index investing became mainstream, attempting to replicate the S&P 500. Ironically, his project failed by succeeding. Rather than simply matching the market, his model consistently outperformed it, uncovering inefficiencies that became the cornerstone of his investment philosophy. In 1987, Navellier would go on to establish Navellier & Associates, a fund dedicated to providing customized portfolio strategies aimed at maximizing returns while effectively managing risk for individual investors.\nWith decades of expertise in translating academic theories into real-world market strategies, Louis Navellier champions a disciplined approach to quantitative analysis for identifying market-beating stocks. His methodology follows a meticulous three-step process: quantitative analysis to pinpoint high-potential opportunities, fundamental analysis to evaluate each candidate's financial health and growth prospects, and portfolio optimization to fine-tune the selection for maximum performance. Throughout his career, Navellier has identified numerous \u201cthousand-percent winners,\u201d from Conair\u2019s dominance in the hair dryer market during the 1980s to NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in AI chips today. His methodology emphasizes discovering well-managed companies that lead their industries, particularly those with expanding operating margins and steady earnings growth.\nNavellier's U.S. Outlook\nIn a Market 360 article, Louis Navellier offered insights into the recent presidential election and its potential market implications under a Trump 2.0 administration. He highlighted the critical role manufacturing played in the 2024 election outcome by pointing to the Institute of Supply Management's (ISM) report, which revealed a decline in the manufacturing index to 46.5 in October from 47.2 in September, signaling contraction (any reading below 50). The details paint an even grimmer picture: The Bureau of Labor Statistics' payroll report has revised August and September job figures downward by a combined 112,000. As such, manufacturing took a significant hit, with 46,000 jobs lost, partly due to Boeing's ongoing challenges. Here's what Navellier had to say about the report:\nStory Continues\n\"All in all, this payroll report was a statistical mess and will likely need to be revised when we have more information. But it also drove Treasury yields lower and increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut key interest rates, since the Fed is now more worried about the job market than inflation.\"\nAccording to Navellier, the new administration is expected to drive growth in the manufacturing sector through a combination of measures: implementing tariffs to counter unfair overseas competition, encouraging the Federal Reserve to maintain lower interest rates, and leveraging cheaper energy prices that position the U.S. favorably compared to Europe and Japan. He noted that if these strategies succeed, the U.S. could see a manufacturing boom.\nOn the other hand, Navellier has been one of the biggest heralds of AI and its implications. Currently, many investors remain heavily focused on the \"first generation\" of AI stocks and while Wall Street's AI darling is likely to continue generating returns, Navellier states that it has become yesterday's story. According to the investor, the real opportunity lies in the \"second generation\" of AI stocks; companies poised to harness generative AI to build profitable enterprises and revolutionize existing industries. This next wave will usher in transformational change of a kind that happens only once every 25 years. The companies that adapt to this second wave of AI will soar, delivering years of outperformance. Those that fail to embrace this shift risk falling behind\u2014or even disappearing altogether. Conversely, Navellier believes that AI will also dismantle outdated industries and businesses. The \"Real AI Boom\", as he calls it, will mint new millionaires\u2014and even billionaires\u2014while driving hundreds, if not thousands, of stocks worldwide to collapse.\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Navellier & Associates\u2019 stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNavellier & Associates\u2019 Stake Value: $67.32 million\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holders: 193\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a global leader in graphics computing and networking, leverages its GPUs to dominate the gaming and AI markets, contributing to its trillion-dollar valuation.\nOn November 22, Jefferies reaffirmed its Buy rating for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a price target of $185. The firm projects sustained demand for NVIDIA's Hopper products through mid-2025, with Blackwell products expected to face supply constraints well into late 2025 and potentially 2026. Insights from the SC24 industry conference further highlighted robust demand for NVIDIA's offerings, consistent with the strong levels observed in 2023.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported a record $35.1 billion in total revenue, exceeding expectations, and forecasts $37.5 billion for the next quarter. The upcoming Blackwell chips are also anticipated to significantly drive revenues. Although initial ramp-up costs for Blackwell may temporarily pressure gross margins, the company expects them to stabilize at mid-70% levels in the latter half of the year.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Louis Navellier's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

A $10,000 Nvidia investment would be worth $9.44 million today, and $100,000 would be $94.4 million, according to Bespoke.\nOf course, that would've required a significant level of faith to hold onto Nvidia through some white-knuckle market downturns like the Great Financial Crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Federal Reserve's most aggressive rate-hiking campaign in over 40 years.\nBespoke also pointed out that Nvidia is the best performer on a total-return basis over the last two decades among all stocks on the S&P 1500, which includes the large-cap S&P 500, the S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600.\nYou can thank the AI boom, which propelled Nvidia from a chip company best known for graphics processors used in video games to the indispensable supplier of technology that powers generative AI. In a sign of the times, the stock replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average last month.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang has done well for himself too. He's number 11 on the Bloomberg Billionaire Index with a net worth of $118 billion.\nAnother company that also experienced a transformation and has delivered massive gains is Netflix, which went from renting out DVDs by mail to becoming a streaming and original content powerhouse that has upended Hollywood.\nBespoke calculated that a $1,000 investment in Netflix stock 20 year ago would be worth more than $550,000 today.\nNvidia and Netflix are among eight stocks that have turned $1,000 into more than $100,000 over the last 20 years. Others include Texas Pacific Land, Apple, Booking Holdings, Monster Beverage, Intuitive Surgical, and Amazon, Bespoke said.\nNFL legend Rob Gronkowski also showed us the power of picking the right stock at the right time. He told Fortune that he bought $69,000 worth of Apple stock on advice from his contractor 10 years ago, and that investment is now worth $600,000.\n\"Let me tell you, he built my house, and he gave all the money back to me by telling me to invest in Apple,\" he said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nLook, I am momentarily tired of talking about Trump tariffs.\nThis past month, I've used this lovely newsletter to slice and dice the risk to investors from potential tariffs on everything from sneakers to computer chips to cars. I am not saying whatever President-elect Donald Trump is about to do on tariffs isn't important \u2014 it most certainly is, a point reinforced to me when I chatted with Gap CEO Richard Dickson, Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Fran Horowitz, and HP Inc. CEO Enrique Lores.\nBut the reality is we have no clue what Trump will ultimately decide and how it will impact the economy and the world order of business. Hence, I think we've truly entered the speculative zone on tariffs until Jan. 20, aka Trump's second inauguration.\nSo I encourage you \u2014 the interested investor \u2014 to spend the next few weeks searching for investment themes that can win whether or not tariffs get enacted. Dare I say this would be akin to creating the Trump-resistant investor guide?\nI have one chapter for you in that guide after a week of research: humanoid robots.\n\"This has gone from sci-fi to development and is about to kind of launch into something very big,\" Citi Global Insights head of innovation technology and future of work Rob Garlick said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below).\nI invited Rob and his teammate, analyst Wenyan Fei, onto the pod after receiving their new, in-depth work on the future of humanoid robots.\nI was blown away by the pace of development, possible use cases, and growth potential. Best believe there's more going on in the sector than Tesla's (TSLA) Optimus being able to catch a ball.\nHere are the numbers and finer points Garlick and Fei put behind humanoids:\nThere could be 648 million humanoids moving around us by 2050, from about zero today.\nThe total addressable market (TAM) for humanoids may reach $209 billion by 2035 and $7 trillion by 2050.\nThe top four use cases in terms of growth potential are parcel delivery, construction, food delivery, and home services.\nThere are more than 50 companies that have developed working humanoid robots. Some noteworthy players include Alfie, a robot butler from Prosper Robotics that apparently can make your bed, and Kime, the humanoid from Macco Robotics that is a bartender. A few others can be seen in the graphic below.\nAssuming a $30,000 cost for humanoids versus the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for humans, the average payback period for a humanoid for a business is around 43 weeks. This assumes the humanoid works 96 hours a week. It may not be a bad thing for businesses if they don't have to pay humans \u2014 no time off, no lagging employees, no overtime pay, no PIPs, no hassle!\nChina is moving very fast in the space, Garlick said.\nStory Continues\nUnsurprisingly, as humanoids penetrate our lives and do things like help take care of aging parents (which I mentioned as personally appealing in the pod), it will have profound changes on the concept of work.\n\"It could have a significant impact,\" Garlick said, pointing to humanoids not needing days off or any other human worker perks. What holds them back are only two factors: They need to be charged (aka a version of human rest) and their parts need to be replaced after excessive wear.\nRead more: What you missed at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference\nAs of right now, if you are a true believer in humanoids, one of the simplest ways to play it is through Tesla. But then again, that's a highly politicized electric car company masquerading as a future leader in robotics, not a pure play. So buyer beware.\nThe other name to watch is artificial intelligence darling Nvidia, which is penetrating the humanoid domain with its various computing offerings (and doing so, I think, before its rivals in the chip sector).\nListen to more episodes of Opening Bid\nBlack Friday? Try Black November, says retail veteran Mickey Drexler\nProperty Brothers: Millions of boomers will need to retrofit their homes\nCraigslist founder is giving away $200 million to prevent cybercrimes against the US\nMost of the players racing to advance the technology are private, likely with an eye toward going public in the future or selling out to someone in Big Tech.\nWho knows, maybe two years from now it will be Soz writing this newsletter \u2014 the humanoid journalist able to work 336 hours straight instead of just 100.\nThree times each week, I drive insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

          "whole_article": "Stocks will enter the final month of 2024 near record highs as investors look to cap off what's been another stellar year for US stocks.\nDuring last week's holiday-shortened trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 2%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended November at all-time highs.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's November jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also scatter the schedule.\nInvestors will look to this week's economic data for clarity on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, which will be announced on Dec. 18.\nIn corporate news, earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Okta (OKTA), and Lululemon (LULU) will highlight the coming week's schedule.\n\u2022 USD\n(^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA labor look-in\nExpectations for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have shifted in recent months.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a 66% chance the Fed cuts rates at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But looking out further, markets are pricing in just two more rate cuts over the next year, with concerns growing about the Fed's progress on bringing down inflation.\nA labor market that continues to slow, but not dramatically, also likely keeps the Fed focused on inflation, which makes a less compelling case for aggressive rate cuts in 2025. An update on that narrative will come with the November jobs report, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nEconomists expect the report to show a reversal of the dismal October employment report that many believed was heavily impacted by hurricanes and worker strikes.\nThe November report is expected to show the US labor market added 200,000 jobs in the month, up from the 12,000 monthly job additions seen in October. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to have inched up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\"Through the monthly swings of nonfarm payrolls, we expect the November employment report to reiterate that while the labor market remains solid in an absolute sense, the softening trend in employment conditions has yet to cease,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients. \"That message is likely to come through more clearly from the unemployment rate, which we look to rise to 4.2%.\"\nStory Continues\n'Magnificent' earnings revisions\nWall Street strategists have been largely bullish when issuing 2025 forecasts, with strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance seeing the S&P 500 ending the year between 6,400 and 7,000. A frequent call in these outlooks has been for a continued broadening of the stock market rally away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 and toward the other 493 stocks in the index.\n\"We\u2019ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it\u2019s a close call,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote, emphasizing that another strong year of economic growth could help support the S&P 493.\nBut not everyone agrees. Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out that Big Tech continues to top earnings estimates each quarter. And as long as that streak continues, Krishna argued \"Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year.\"\nTo Krishna's point, while the broadening is expected to take place throughout next year, earnings revisions remain more positive for many Big Tech names than the rest of the S&P 500.\nIn a research note published on Nov. 27, DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe pointed out that six Big Tech companies have seen earnings revisions for the current quarter come in either flat or higher in the past 30 days. Only Microsoft and Apple have seen their earnings estimates cut more than the S&P 500's 1.2% estimate trim in that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500's 10 largest non-tech companies have seen earnings estimates slashed by an average of 2.7%.\n\"US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings,\" Rabe wrote. \"Fortunately, Big Tech makes up a third of the S&P, so their fundamentals have an outsized impact on the index.\"\nThe case for a strong December\nAnother popular call among strategists has been for the roaring bull market to continue through year-end, with more all-time highs in store before trading wraps up in 2024.\nAnd history supports that argument.\nCarson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that, in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 out of 10 times. Since 2000, the index has risen every December after a rally of this magnitude over the year's first 11 months.\n\"History says a chase into year-end is quite possible,\" Detrick wrote in a research note.\nWeekly Calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, November final (48.8 expected, 48.8 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, October (0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); ISM Manufacturing, November (47.6 expected, 46.5 previously); ISM prices paid, November (54.8 expected);\nEarnings: Zscaler (ZS)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: Job openings, October (7.51 million expected, 7.44 million previously);\nEarnings: Box (BOX), Marvell (MRVL), Okta (OKTA), Pure Storage (PSTG), Salesforce (CRM)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Nov. 29 (+6.3% previously); ADP Private Payrolls, November (+165,000 expected, +233,000 previously); S&P Global US Services PMI, November final (57 previously), S&P Global US Composite PMI, November final (55.3 previously); ISM Services index, November (55.5 expected, 56 previously); ISM Services prices paid, November (58.1 previously); Factory orders, October (0.3% expected, -0.5% previously); Durable goods orders, October final (+0.2% previously)\nEarnings: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Campbell's (CPB), ChargePoint (CHPT), Chewy (CHWY), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below (FIVE), Foot Locker (FL), Hormel Foods (HRL), RBC (RBC), Victoria's Secret (VSCO)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, November (+50.9% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Nov. 30 (213,000 previously)\nEarnings: BMO (BMO), Build-a-Bear Workshop (BBW), Dollar General (DG), DocuSign (DOCU), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Kroger (KR), Lululemon (LULU), Petco (WOOF), TD Bank (TD), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\nFriday\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, November (+200,000 expected, +12,000 previously); Unemployment rate, November (4.2% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+3.9% expected, +4% previously); Average weekly hours worked, November (34.3 expected, 34.3 previously); Labor force participation rate, November (62.6% previously)\nEarnings: BRP (DOOO)\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Last week, for example, Zuckerberg met face-to-face with Trump at his Florida hotel and club Mar-a-Lago.\nCarr has long called for a focus on reining in Big Tech. He has accused Alphabet-owned Google of manipulating search results and demonizing YouTube users, Meta-owned Facebook of inconsistently tinkering with user content, and Chinese-owned TikTok of jeopardizing national security.\nCarr has also outlined his vision for a remake of the FCC in a right-of-center policy proposal known as Project 2025. Trump distanced himself from that document during the 2024 presidential campaign.\nOne specific focus for a new Republican-oriented FCC, Carr said in Project 2025, should be to do away with legal immunity known as Section 230 protection that insulates social media companies from liability when they police third party content.\nStory Continues\nCarr said dominant technology corporations abuse their dominant market position and Section 230\u2019s legal protection to \"drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.\"\n\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the chapter he authored on the FCC.\nFederal Communications Commission commissioner Brendan Carr while testifying in June 2020 before a Senate committee. Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\n\"They are not simply prevailing in the free market; they are taking advantage of a landscape that has been skewed\u2014in many cases by the government\u2014to favor their business models.\"\nAs a remedy, Carr said Congress should not only remove \"carte blanche\" Section 230 immunity but also impose transparency rules similar to those that imposed on broadband providers.\nThat would require social media platforms to publish more specific terms of service and operate an appeals process for content creators to challenge companies that take down their posts.\nFight for the Future, a nonprofit group that advocates for online privacy, expressed concerns in an email to Yahoo Finance that Carr would upend net neutrality rules, which require internet service providers (ISPs) to treat all data on the Internet equally.\nCarr voted to end net neutrality rules in 2017.\nCarr in Project 2025 also said the FCC should do more to protect Americans against already identified national and personal security threats posed by the social media app TikTok, and telecommunication equipment manufacturers, Huawei and ZTE.\nTikTok\u2019s platform, Carr said, provides Beijing \"with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign\" by curating news and information seen by millions of Americans.\nCongress and President Joe Biden agreed months ago to outlaw TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nCongress and President Joe Biden agreed months ago to outlaw TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail suggested he may at least try to lessen the impact of a law signed by Biden in April that makes Chinese ownership of the app illegal.\nCarr also has called for the FCC to do a better job at updating its \"covered list\" of telecommunications equipment manufactures that pose a risk to US national security, Carr said.\nHuawei and ZTE are included in that list. And a loophole, he said, should be closed so that companies like China Telecom, cannot operate unregulated data centers in the US.\nCarr has said Big Tech should pay its \"fair share\" into the FCC\u2019s $9 billion universal service fund that subsidizes affordable Internet and rural connectivity programs.\nInstead of relying on telecommunications consumers for the bulk of its funding, he said, Big Tech should pay because the federally supported networks are used to deliver the company products and services.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in December.\nJared Cohen, Goldman Sachs president of global affairs, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that amid rising data center-driven energy demand because of AI, the US would need to collaborate with other countries via \u201cdiplomacy.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at data centers for cloud workloads versus data centers for AI workloads, data centers for AI workloads require ultra-high density. They need a concentrated power source, and so intermittent power like wind and solar doesn\u2019t fit the bill. You need base load power, so I think nuclear, coal, and natural gas are necessary, and we have plenty of that in the US. The problem is we can\u2019t transport it from where it is through multiple jurisdictions because of the \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 issue. So, the US is going to need some kind of overflow option if it wants to continue leading in this space. There\u2019s not a single geography that I would say represents a panacea to this problem.\u201d\nAnswering a question about whether the return to relatively cheaper and reliable energy sources like coal could satisfy the AI-driven energy demand, the analyst said the US would still need to look beyond just relying on its own sources because the need for power is huge.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to probably bring another 35-plus gigawatts of power online relative to the 17 gigawatts of power that are already online feeding these data centers in just the next couple of years. That\u2019s not enough, that\u2019s not enough time. So, you know, the US is going to continue to lead in the space, but it\u2019s not going to be able to lead on its own.\u201d\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are getting investors\u2019 attention on the back of latest news. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAnalyst: Alphabet (GOOG) AI Overviews Impact Positive But Search Busines \u2018Not Out of The Woods Yet\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\nStory Continues\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 160\nGene Munster from Deepwater Asset Management said while talking to CNBC that the latest quarterly report from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of the most important in years because investors were looking for the impact of generative AI on the company\u2019s search business and the performance of AI Overviews.\n\u201cI think this is probably the most important Google report in maybe 7 to 10 years, something around there. The reason is that 7 to 10 years ago, there was a lot of debate about how mobile was going to impact the business. Of course, that\u2019s been the narrative around Google for the last year\u2014how AI is going to impact the business. What we saw in their U.S. business, where the AI overviews saw their first full quarter, was that expectations were it would grow at 12%, but it grew at 19%. I think this is the first evidence, and the call has just been a chorus of commentary about how AI overviews are having a positive impact on the business. Now, we\u2019re not out of the woods yet for Google investors, but I think this is the most encouraging data point after a lot of hand-wringing over the last several quarters.\u201d\nThe market has been ignoring Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught.\nWith the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google\u2019s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader.\nWhat are the key drivers for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)?\nAlphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August.\nThis growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day\u2014substantially higher than Uber\u2019s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber\u2019s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo\u2019s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing.\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s Search & Other segment saw a 12.2% year-over-year revenue increase, rising from $44.03 billion to $49.39 billion. YouTube advertising also performed well, with revenue up 12.2% to $8.92 billion from $7.95 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue grew even more sharply, surging 27.8% from $8.34 billion to $10.66 billion.\nGoogle Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit\u2014a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment\u2019s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the parent company of Google and a global leader in digital services and technology. Its main operating segments include Google Services (Search, YouTube, Google Play, Maps, etc.), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Other Bets (innovative ventures such as Waymo and Verily). Google Services generate most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, primarily from advertising. Their GCP provides infrastructure and tools for businesses, including AI and machine learning services. Alphabet extensively integrated AI across its products, enhancing search algorithms, personalizing content on YouTube, improving ad targeting, and driving innovations such as Waymo, their autonomous driving segment. While the company reported better-than-expected fiscal second quarter revenues and earnings, driven by strength in Search and GCP, advertising revenues from YouTube came in lower than expected. Separately, investor skepticism around the return on investment from Alphabet\u2019s significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure also weighed on the company\u2019s share price. Despite reporting overall positive operating results, shares detracted from performance.\u201d\nOverall, GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in December. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Recent comments from the eccentric billionaire suggest that he is planning to launch an AI-powered gaming studio through xAI that will rival the game studios that are owned by massive corporations. He made the remarks in a post on social networking platform X. The startup has ballooned in valuation over the past few years.

For example, tech news platform TechCrunch reports that Pathway, an AI startup, just raised a $10 million Seed round to build live AI systems that, the company claims, think and learn in real-time as humans do. Per the report, the Pathway offering includes what it calls infrastructure components that power live AI systems, feeding on structured and unstructured data, meaning that enterprise AI platforms can make decisions on up-to-date knowledge.

          "whole_article": "Stocks will enter the final month of 2024 near record highs as investors look to cap off what's been another stellar year for US stocks.\nDuring last week's holiday-shortened trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 2%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended November at all-time highs.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's November jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also scatter the schedule.\nInvestors will look to this week's economic data for clarity on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, which will be announced on Dec. 18.\nIn corporate news, earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Okta (OKTA), and Lululemon (LULU) will highlight the coming week's schedule.\n\u2022 USD\n(^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA labor look-in\nExpectations for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have shifted in recent months.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a 66% chance the Fed cuts rates at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But looking out further, markets are pricing in just two more rate cuts over the next year, with concerns growing about the Fed's progress on bringing down inflation.\nA labor market that continues to slow, but not dramatically, also likely keeps the Fed focused on inflation, which makes a less compelling case for aggressive rate cuts in 2025. An update on that narrative will come with the November jobs report, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nEconomists expect the report to show a reversal of the dismal October employment report that many believed was heavily impacted by hurricanes and worker strikes.\nThe November report is expected to show the US labor market added 200,000 jobs in the month, up from the 12,000 monthly job additions seen in October. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to have inched up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\"Through the monthly swings of nonfarm payrolls, we expect the November employment report to reiterate that while the labor market remains solid in an absolute sense, the softening trend in employment conditions has yet to cease,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients. \"That message is likely to come through more clearly from the unemployment rate, which we look to rise to 4.2%.\"\nStory Continues\n'Magnificent' earnings revisions\nWall Street strategists have been largely bullish when issuing 2025 forecasts, with strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance seeing the S&P 500 ending the year between 6,400 and 7,000. A frequent call in these outlooks has been for a continued broadening of the stock market rally away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 and toward the other 493 stocks in the index.\n\"We\u2019ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it\u2019s a close call,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote, emphasizing that another strong year of economic growth could help support the S&P 493.\nBut not everyone agrees. Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out that Big Tech continues to top earnings estimates each quarter. And as long as that streak continues, Krishna argued \"Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year.\"\nTo Krishna's point, while the broadening is expected to take place throughout next year, earnings revisions remain more positive for many Big Tech names than the rest of the S&P 500.\nIn a research note published on Nov. 27, DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe pointed out that six Big Tech companies have seen earnings revisions for the current quarter come in either flat or higher in the past 30 days. Only Microsoft and Apple have seen their earnings estimates cut more than the S&P 500's 1.2% estimate trim in that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500's 10 largest non-tech companies have seen earnings estimates slashed by an average of 2.7%.\n\"US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings,\" Rabe wrote. \"Fortunately, Big Tech makes up a third of the S&P, so their fundamentals have an outsized impact on the index.\"\nThe case for a strong December\nAnother popular call among strategists has been for the roaring bull market to continue through year-end, with more all-time highs in store before trading wraps up in 2024.\nAnd history supports that argument.\nCarson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that, in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 out of 10 times. Since 2000, the index has risen every December after a rally of this magnitude over the year's first 11 months.\n\"History says a chase into year-end is quite possible,\" Detrick wrote in a research note.\nWeekly Calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, November final (48.8 expected, 48.8 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, October (0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); ISM Manufacturing, November (47.6 expected, 46.5 previously); ISM prices paid, November (54.8 expected);\nEarnings: Zscaler (ZS)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: Job openings, October (7.51 million expected, 7.44 million previously);\nEarnings: Box (BOX), Marvell (MRVL), Okta (OKTA), Pure Storage (PSTG), Salesforce (CRM)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Nov. 29 (+6.3% previously); ADP Private Payrolls, November (+165,000 expected, +233,000 previously); S&P Global US Services PMI, November final (57 previously), S&P Global US Composite PMI, November final (55.3 previously); ISM Services index, November (55.5 expected, 56 previously); ISM Services prices paid, November (58.1 previously); Factory orders, October (0.3% expected, -0.5% previously); Durable goods orders, October final (+0.2% previously)\nEarnings: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Campbell's (CPB), ChargePoint (CHPT), Chewy (CHWY), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below (FIVE), Foot Locker (FL), Hormel Foods (HRL), RBC (RBC), Victoria's Secret (VSCO)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, November (+50.9% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Nov. 30 (213,000 previously)\nEarnings: BMO (BMO), Build-a-Bear Workshop (BBW), Dollar General (DG), DocuSign (DOCU), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Kroger (KR), Lululemon (LULU), Petco (WOOF), TD Bank (TD), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\nFriday\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, November (+200,000 expected, +12,000 previously); Unemployment rate, November (4.2% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+3.9% expected, +4% previously); Average weekly hours worked, November (34.3 expected, 34.3 previously); Labor force participation rate, November (62.6% previously)\nEarnings: BRP (DOOO)\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The company is leveraging its vast ecosystem of apps\u2014including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger\u2014to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities. For instance, the introduction of Meta AI, an assistant built on its Llama 3 language model, has reached 500 million users within just seven months.\nIn addition to its aggressive AI investments, Meta has differentiated itself by open-sourcing its AI models, such as Llama 3. While competitors like OpenAI and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) typically keep their models proprietary, Meta\u2019s open-source strategy fosters innovation and collaboration, enabling other technology companies and developers to test and improve its models.\nMoreover, Meta is a leader in AI model transparency. It has developed methodologies to make AI decision-making processes fully interpretable, addressing the \u201cblack box\u201d problem in AI. By pioneering transparency and accountability, Meta is positioning itself as a responsible leader in the AI industry\u2014a critical advantage as AI adoption expands into high-stakes fields such as healthcare and finance.\nMETA Stock\u2019s Valuation\nMeta\u2019s rise in AI, though initially unexpected, is now firmly on the radar of technology investors. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the company is trading near all-time highs. However, what should it be trading at? To value the firm, I first estimate Meta\u2019s full-year 2034 EBITDA at $278.65 billion. Assuming a conservative EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 12.3, reflecting slower growth expectations compared to recent years, Meta\u2019s December 2034 enterprise value would be $3.43 trillion.\nWith a median weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of approximately 8.5% over the past decade, I then discount this forecasted enterprise value back to December 2024, arriving at an intrinsic value of $1.52 trillion. As Meta\u2019s current enterprise value is $1.41 trillion, this implies a modest 7.6% margin of safety for investors.\nStory Continues\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About Meta?\nMeta currently holds a Strong Buy consensus rating on Wall Street, with an average META price target of $662.62, implying 15.4% upside potential. This is based on 40 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell, further supporting my view that Meta is a viable investment option.\nSee more META analyst ratings\nMicrosoft Is Dominating in AI and Is Undervalued\nI\u2019m also highly bullish on Microsoft, which has a commanding presence in cloud-based AI, particularly through its Azure platform. It leads in traditional AI and generative AI adoption, boasting the highest number of new AI customers and generative AI users compared to peers AWS (AMZN) and Google. Microsoft\u2019s leadership is reinforced by its partnership with OpenAI, which has enabled seamless integration of cutting-edge AI technologies into its cloud services.\nUnlike Meta, Microsoft has a clear and direct monetization pathway for its AI capabilities. The company has integrated AI across its product suite, enhancing user experiences with tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is now used by nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies.\nMicrosoft also prioritizes ethical and transparent AI, which is crucial for its focus on high-impact sectors such as healthcare. Its advancements in multimodal medical imaging and AI-driven nursing workflow solutions are significantly improving patient care. Furthermore, Microsoft\u2019s AI initiatives extend into finance, customer service, and defense, as seen through its collaboration with Palantir (PLTR) on AI solutions for Western defense.\nMSFT Stock\u2019s Valuation\nTo value Microsoft, I first estimate its December 2034 EBITDA at $616.8 billion. Applying a conservative EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 20.3\u2014aligned with the midpoint of its 10-year median and five-year average\u2014my forecast for Microsoft\u2019s enterprise value by December 2034 is $12.52 trillion.\nFurthermore, Microsoft\u2019s WACC stands at 9.81%, with equity making up 97.64% and debt accounting for 2.36%. After discounting my December 2034 forecast back to December 2024, I calculate an intrinsic enterprise value of $4.91 trillion. Given Microsoft\u2019s current enterprise value of $3.13 trillion, this represents a substantial 56.91% margin of safety for investors.\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About Microsoft?\nMicrosoft also has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Wall Street, with an average MSFT price target of $496.92, implying 17.35% upside potential. This rating is supported by 26 Buys, three Holds, and no Sells, reinforcing my thesis that Microsoft is an attractive investment opportunity.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nConclusion: Microsoft Is the Better Investment\nWhile both Meta and Microsoft are poised for substantial long-term growth driven by their strategic positions in AI, Microsoft offers the better investment opportunity today due to its superior valuation and monetization strategy. Even if Meta succeeds in developing the most advanced AI models, its ability to monetize these capabilities may be more challenging compared to Microsoft\u2019s established pathways. Given the security and stability that Microsoft provides, I favor buying its stock while holding off on Meta for now.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

The AI models behind the famous AI assistant have, however, started to attract unwanted attention in recent months. For example, news publication The Guardian has reported that a group of major news organizations in Canada have sued the AI firm for allegedly strip-mining journalism and unjustly enriching itself by using news articles to train the popular ChatGPT software. Per the report, the suit was filed in the superior court of justice in Ontario and calls for punitive damages, a share of profits made by OpenAI from using the articles, and an injunction barring the San Francisco-based company from using any of the news articles in the future.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOpenAI has faced similar suits in recent months but has managed to fight back without incurring financial harm. The latest suit, per the report, includes news platforms like the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Press, the CBC, the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, and Postmedia. The companies want up to C$20,000 in damages for each article used by OpenAI, suggesting a victory in court could be worth billions.

Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) we really liked what we saw.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Alphabet:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.31 = US$109b \u00f7 (US$430b - US$81b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nThus, Alphabet has an ROCE of 31%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 6.7%.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\nNasdaqGS:GOOGL Return on Capital Employed November 30th 2024\nIn the above chart we have measured Alphabet's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Alphabet .\nThe Trend Of ROCE\nWe like the trends that we're seeing from Alphabet. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 31%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 56%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Alphabet thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\nIn Conclusion...\nIn summary, it's great to see that Alphabet can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Since the stock has returned a staggering 153% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\nOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation.

Following a thorough investigation, the Bureau has filed an application with the Competition Tribunal that seeks to remedy the conduct for the benefit of Canadians. This case is about online web advertising, which consists of ads shown to users when they visit websites. Many publishers count on digital ad revenue to support their activities and reach. Digital ad inventory is often purchased and sold through automated auctions using sophisticated platforms. These individual platforms are known as ad tech tools while the entire suite of tools used throughout the buy and sell process are collectively known as the ad tech stack. The Bureau\u2019s investigation found that, in Canada, Google is the largest provider across the ad tech stack for web advertising and has abused its dominant position through conduct intended to ensure that it would maintain and entrench its market power. Google\u2019s conduct locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, prevents rivals from being able to compete on the merits of their offering, and otherwise distorts the competitive process. In particular, the Bureau found that Google has: unlawfully tied its various ad tech tools together to maintain its market dominance; and leveraged its position across these ad tech tools to distort auction dynamics by: giving its own tools preferential access to ad inventory, taking negative margins in certain circumstances to disadvantage rivals, and dictating the terms on which its own publisher customers could transact with rival ad tech tools. The Bureau\u2019s position is that by implementing this anticompetitive conduct, Google has been able to entrench its dominance, prevent rivals from competing, inhibit innovation, inflate advertising costs and reduce publishers\u2019 revenues.

The decision mandates Google to let competing app shops on its Play platform and to make its app library available to rivals. Set to be binding for three years, these amendments are on hold awaiting the scrutiny of the appeal court.\nGoogle said in its complaint that the jury should not have heard the case Epic Games, the creator of the video game \"Fortnite,\" file. Google said that the lawsuit aimed to limit Google's activities rather than seek damages. Google also objected to the court allowing Epic to claim that Apple (AAPL, Financials) and Google are not rivals in app distribution or in-app payment systems.\nThe legal conflict arises from a 2020 lawsuit in which Epic Games claimed Google was monopolizing Android device and payment system access. Last year, a San Francisco jury decided in favor of Epic, ruling Google had suppressed competition. Judge Donato ordered Google to carry out various changes based on the outcome, including allowing competing app shops.\nEpic, with its headquarters in Cary, North Carolina, deemed Google's plea to be unworthy. This meritless appeal is Google's desperate attempt to avoid complying with the unanimous jury decision, the company said.\nGoogle has not responded outside of its legal documentation. Enforcing the verdict, according to the business, would hurt customers and app developers and call for a \"dramatic redesign\" of its Android, mobile operating system, and Google Play marketplace.\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Feb. 3, with a decision expected later in the year.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

Here is all the scoop on the tech stock:\nThings started to look bleak for Google\u2019s parent company after a judge said that Google had used exclusive deals to monopolize the search market illegally. In 2023, a top company executive testified during the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust trial that Google paid $26.3 billion to other companies to ensure its search engine was the default on web browsers and mobile phones.\nOn these grounds, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a document that suggested a breakup of the technology giant\u2019s Google search business, including selling its Chrome browser. It prohibits the ownership and control of anything that creates a preference for Google. The proposals, even though not a definitive plan, aim to reduce Google's dominance in the search market, leading to investor concerns about potential operational disruptions and future profitability.

Trump hasn\u2019t been a fan of Google, having recently said search results were biased against him. However, his current stance on Google is unclear. Meanwhile, the news about the search monopoly came in when investors were already worried about the rise of generative artificial intelligence.\nThese genAI technologies have created an opening for competitors like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft, making it easy to imagine a future where traditional search has faded and consumers are communicating with their devices via an AI-generated custom interface.

          "whole_article": "The country\u2019s tech titans might need to start fortifying defenses against the agenda of incoming Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr.\nCarr made that clear in the hour after Trump announced his ascension to the FCC chairmanship seat last month.\n\"We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans,\" Carr said on X, the social media platform.\nJust days before he got that chairmanship appointment, Carr sent letters to Google (GOOG, GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple (APPL) CEO Tim Cook predicting \"broad ranging actions to restore Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights\" once Trump takes office.\nThat might include \"a review of your companies\u2019 activities as well as third-party organizations and groups that have acted to curtail those rights,\" according to a copy of the letter Carr posted to X.\nMany tech CEOs are trying to establish a good relationship with the incoming Trump administration, hoping to improve their standing in the nation's capital after years of aggressive oversight and antitrust lawsuits. Last week, for example, Zuckerberg met face-to-face with Trump at his Florida hotel and club Mar-a-Lago.\nCarr has long called for a focus on reining in Big Tech. He has accused Alphabet-owned Google of manipulating search results and demonizing YouTube users, Meta-owned Facebook of inconsistently tinkering with user content, and Chinese-owned TikTok of jeopardizing national security.\nCarr has also outlined his vision for a remake of the FCC in a right-of-center policy proposal known as Project 2025. Trump distanced himself from that document during the 2024 presidential campaign.\nOne specific focus for a new Republican-oriented FCC, Carr said in Project 2025, should be to do away with legal immunity known as Section 230 protection that insulates social media companies from liability when they police third party content.\nStory Continues\nCarr said dominant technology corporations abuse their dominant market position and Section 230\u2019s legal protection to \"drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.\"\n\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the chapter he authored on the FCC.\nFederal Communications Commission commissioner Brendan Carr while testifying in June 2020 before a Senate committee. Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\n\"They are not simply prevailing in the free market; they are taking advantage of a landscape that has been skewed\u2014in many cases by the government\u2014to favor their business models.\"\nAs a remedy, Carr said Congress should not only remove \"carte blanche\" Section 230 immunity but also impose transparency rules similar to those that imposed on broadband providers.\nThat would require social media platforms to publish more specific terms of service and operate an appeals process for content creators to challenge companies that take down their posts.\nFight for the Future, a nonprofit group that advocates for online privacy, expressed concerns in an email to Yahoo Finance that Carr would upend net neutrality rules, which require internet service providers (ISPs) to treat all data on the Internet equally.\nCarr voted to end net neutrality rules in 2017.\nCarr in Project 2025 also said the FCC should do more to protect Americans against already identified national and personal security threats posed by the social media app TikTok, and telecommunication equipment manufacturers, Huawei and ZTE.\nTikTok\u2019s platform, Carr said, provides Beijing \"with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign\" by curating news and information seen by millions of Americans.\nCongress and President Joe Biden agreed months ago to outlaw TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nCongress and President Joe Biden agreed months ago to outlaw TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail suggested he may at least try to lessen the impact of a law signed by Biden in April that makes Chinese ownership of the app illegal.\nCarr also has called for the FCC to do a better job at updating its \"covered list\" of telecommunications equipment manufactures that pose a risk to US national security, Carr said.\nHuawei and ZTE are included in that list. And a loophole, he said, should be closed so that companies like China Telecom, cannot operate unregulated data centers in the US.\nCarr has said Big Tech should pay its \"fair share\" into the FCC\u2019s $9 billion universal service fund that subsidizes affordable Internet and rural connectivity programs.\nInstead of relying on telecommunications consumers for the bulk of its funding, he said, Big Tech should pay because the federally supported networks are used to deliver the company products and services.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Louis Navellier's Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against Louis Navellier's other stock picks.\nLouis Navellier, Chairman and Founder of Navellier & Associates, is a renowned American investor who is celebrated for his skill in navigating the stock market and delivering impressive profits. Leading a firm dedicated to growth investments, Navellier\u2019s strategy is reflected in his high-performing portfolio. His journey began in a college mainframe computer lab in the 1970s. While studying at the now Cal State East Bay, Navellier set out to validate the prevailing belief that beating the market was impossible. His original aim was to create an index product before index investing became mainstream, attempting to replicate the S&P 500. Ironically, his project failed by succeeding. Rather than simply matching the market, his model consistently outperformed it, uncovering inefficiencies that became the cornerstone of his investment philosophy. In 1987, Navellier would go on to establish Navellier & Associates, a fund dedicated to providing customized portfolio strategies aimed at maximizing returns while effectively managing risk for individual investors.\nWith decades of expertise in translating academic theories into real-world market strategies, Louis Navellier champions a disciplined approach to quantitative analysis for identifying market-beating stocks. His methodology follows a meticulous three-step process: quantitative analysis to pinpoint high-potential opportunities, fundamental analysis to evaluate each candidate's financial health and growth prospects, and portfolio optimization to fine-tune the selection for maximum performance. Throughout his career, Navellier has identified numerous \u201cthousand-percent winners,\u201d from Conair\u2019s dominance in the hair dryer market during the 1980s to NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in AI chips today. His methodology emphasizes discovering well-managed companies that lead their industries, particularly those with expanding operating margins and steady earnings growth.\nNavellier's U.S. Outlook\nIn a Market 360 article, Louis Navellier offered insights into the recent presidential election and its potential market implications under a Trump 2.0 administration. He highlighted the critical role manufacturing played in the 2024 election outcome by pointing to the Institute of Supply Management's (ISM) report, which revealed a decline in the manufacturing index to 46.5 in October from 47.2 in September, signaling contraction (any reading below 50). The details paint an even grimmer picture: The Bureau of Labor Statistics' payroll report has revised August and September job figures downward by a combined 112,000. As such, manufacturing took a significant hit, with 46,000 jobs lost, partly due to Boeing's ongoing challenges. Here's what Navellier had to say about the report:\nStory Continues\n\"All in all, this payroll report was a statistical mess and will likely need to be revised when we have more information. But it also drove Treasury yields lower and increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut key interest rates, since the Fed is now more worried about the job market than inflation.\"\nAccording to Navellier, the new administration is expected to drive growth in the manufacturing sector through a combination of measures: implementing tariffs to counter unfair overseas competition, encouraging the Federal Reserve to maintain lower interest rates, and leveraging cheaper energy prices that position the U.S. favorably compared to Europe and Japan. He noted that if these strategies succeed, the U.S. could see a manufacturing boom.\nOn the other hand, Navellier has been one of the biggest heralds of AI and its implications. Currently, many investors remain heavily focused on the \"first generation\" of AI stocks and while Wall Street's AI darling is likely to continue generating returns, Navellier states that it has become yesterday's story. According to the investor, the real opportunity lies in the \"second generation\" of AI stocks; companies poised to harness generative AI to build profitable enterprises and revolutionize existing industries. This next wave will usher in transformational change of a kind that happens only once every 25 years. The companies that adapt to this second wave of AI will soar, delivering years of outperformance. Those that fail to embrace this shift risk falling behind\u2014or even disappearing altogether. Conversely, Navellier believes that AI will also dismantle outdated industries and businesses. The \"Real AI Boom\", as he calls it, will mint new millionaires\u2014and even billionaires\u2014while driving hundreds, if not thousands, of stocks worldwide to collapse.\nOur Methodology\nFor this analysis, we examined Navellier & Associates\u2019 stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNavellier & Associates\u2019 Stake Value: $13.8 million\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a global leader in technology, focuses on productivity software, cloud services, and personal computing solutions.\nOn November 22, Citi reiterated its Buy rating for MSFT shares, setting a price target of $497. Following Microsoft's Ignite conference, Citi highlighted the company's strong position in AI innovation. The event unveiled over 80 new products and features, with a focus on customizable AI 'agents' designed for various business units rather than specific use cases. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also announced significant updates to its Fabric platform, including future support for SQL Database, and introduced enhanced capabilities for AI Foundry, further strengthening its platform's appeal.\nMoreover, the tech giant reported robust Q1 FY2025 earnings, with revenue rising 16% year-over-year to $65.6 billion. Microsoft Cloud continued its impressive performance, generating over $38.9 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from the prior year. Additionally, the company's AI segment is on track to surpass a $10 billion annual run rate in the upcoming quarter, underscoring its growing influence in the AI space.\nOverall MSFT ranks 8th on our list of Louis Navellier's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Recent comments from the eccentric billionaire suggest that he is planning to launch an AI-powered gaming studio through xAI that will rival the game studios that are owned by massive corporations. He made the remarks in a post on social networking platform X. The startup has ballooned in valuation over the past few years. The Grok developer recently raised $5 billion in new funding, bringing the valuation of the startup to $50 billion, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nJust like xAI, other AI startups are also turning heads in the venture capital world. For example, tech news platform TechCrunch reports that Pathway, an AI startup, just raised a $10 million Seed round to build live AI systems that, the company claims, think and learn in real-time as humans do. Per the report, the Pathway offering includes what it calls infrastructure components that power live AI systems, feeding on structured and unstructured data, meaning that enterprise AI platforms can make decisions on up-to-date knowledge. Customers so far include NATO and the French post office, the report adds.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. The tech giant recently partnered with professional services firm PwC for a research paper that explores how businesses can more successfully implement AI solutions. Per the recommendations from the study, companies should assess cloud infrastructures and consider how current cloud architecture meets future organizational needs. This is important because according to PwC, only a small number of businesses have so far benefited from integrating AI and cloud technology, allowing them to more readily unlock new value from data as they build new AI capabilities.\nStory Continues\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Stocks will enter the final month of 2024 near record highs as investors look to cap off what's been another stellar year for US stocks.\nDuring last week's holiday-shortened trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 2%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended November at all-time highs.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's November jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also scatter the schedule.\nInvestors will look to this week's economic data for clarity on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, which will be announced on Dec. 18.\nIn corporate news, earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Okta (OKTA), and Lululemon (LULU) will highlight the coming week's schedule.\n\u2022 USD\n(^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA labor look-in\nExpectations for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have shifted in recent months.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a 66% chance the Fed cuts rates at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But looking out further, markets are pricing in just two more rate cuts over the next year, with concerns growing about the Fed's progress on bringing down inflation.\nA labor market that continues to slow, but not dramatically, also likely keeps the Fed focused on inflation, which makes a less compelling case for aggressive rate cuts in 2025. An update on that narrative will come with the November jobs report, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nEconomists expect the report to show a reversal of the dismal October employment report that many believed was heavily impacted by hurricanes and worker strikes.\nThe November report is expected to show the US labor market added 200,000 jobs in the month, up from the 12,000 monthly job additions seen in October. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to have inched up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\"Through the monthly swings of nonfarm payrolls, we expect the November employment report to reiterate that while the labor market remains solid in an absolute sense, the softening trend in employment conditions has yet to cease,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients. \"That message is likely to come through more clearly from the unemployment rate, which we look to rise to 4.2%.\"\nStory Continues\n'Magnificent' earnings revisions\nWall Street strategists have been largely bullish when issuing 2025 forecasts, with strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance seeing the S&P 500 ending the year between 6,400 and 7,000. A frequent call in these outlooks has been for a continued broadening of the stock market rally away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 and toward the other 493 stocks in the index.\n\"We\u2019ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it\u2019s a close call,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote, emphasizing that another strong year of economic growth could help support the S&P 493.\nBut not everyone agrees. Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out that Big Tech continues to top earnings estimates each quarter. And as long as that streak continues, Krishna argued \"Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year.\"\nTo Krishna's point, while the broadening is expected to take place throughout next year, earnings revisions remain more positive for many Big Tech names than the rest of the S&P 500.\nIn a research note published on Nov. 27, DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe pointed out that six Big Tech companies have seen earnings revisions for the current quarter come in either flat or higher in the past 30 days. Only Microsoft and Apple have seen their earnings estimates cut more than the S&P 500's 1.2% estimate trim in that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500's 10 largest non-tech companies have seen earnings estimates slashed by an average of 2.7%.\n\"US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings,\" Rabe wrote. \"Fortunately, Big Tech makes up a third of the S&P, so their fundamentals have an outsized impact on the index.\"\nThe case for a strong December\nAnother popular call among strategists has been for the roaring bull market to continue through year-end, with more all-time highs in store before trading wraps up in 2024.\nAnd history supports that argument.\nCarson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that, in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 out of 10 times. Since 2000, the index has risen every December after a rally of this magnitude over the year's first 11 months.\n\"History says a chase into year-end is quite possible,\" Detrick wrote in a research note.\nWeekly Calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, November final (48.8 expected, 48.8 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, October (0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); ISM Manufacturing, November (47.6 expected, 46.5 previously); ISM prices paid, November (54.8 expected);\nEarnings: Zscaler (ZS)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: Job openings, October (7.51 million expected, 7.44 million previously);\nEarnings: Box (BOX), Marvell (MRVL), Okta (OKTA), Pure Storage (PSTG), Salesforce (CRM)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Nov. 29 (+6.3% previously); ADP Private Payrolls, November (+165,000 expected, +233,000 previously); S&P Global US Services PMI, November final (57 previously), S&P Global US Composite PMI, November final (55.3 previously); ISM Services index, November (55.5 expected, 56 previously); ISM Services prices paid, November (58.1 previously); Factory orders, October (0.3% expected, -0.5% previously); Durable goods orders, October final (+0.2% previously)\nEarnings: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Campbell's (CPB), ChargePoint (CHPT), Chewy (CHWY), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below (FIVE), Foot Locker (FL), Hormel Foods (HRL), RBC (RBC), Victoria's Secret (VSCO)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, November (+50.9% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Nov. 30 (213,000 previously)\nEarnings: BMO (BMO), Build-a-Bear Workshop (BBW), Dollar General (DG), DocuSign (DOCU), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Kroger (KR), Lululemon (LULU), Petco (WOOF), TD Bank (TD), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\nFriday\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, November (+200,000 expected, +12,000 previously); Unemployment rate, November (4.2% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+3.9% expected, +4% previously); Average weekly hours worked, November (34.3 expected, 34.3 previously); Labor force participation rate, November (62.6% previously)\nEarnings: BRP (DOOO)\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Let\u2019s take a look at Microsoft\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\nSee our latest analysis for Microsoft\nWhat Is Microsoft Worth?\nAccording to our valuation model, Microsoft seems to be fairly priced at around 17% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $510.15, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, Microsoft has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.\nWhat does the future of Microsoft look like?\nNasdaqGS:MSFT Earnings and Revenue Growth December 1st 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Microsoft's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 50%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? MSFT\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on MSFT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Per the report, the vast majority of the revenue comes from other companies that Musk chairs, as Grok is only available to users of the X social network, and it has been used as a customer service feature for the Starlink internet service.

For instance, the introduction of Meta AI, an assistant built on its Llama 3 language model, has reached 500 million users within just seven months.\nIn addition to its aggressive AI investments, Meta has differentiated itself by open-sourcing its AI models, such as Llama 3. While competitors like OpenAI and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) typically keep their models proprietary, Meta\u2019s open-source strategy fosters innovation and collaboration, enabling other technology companies and developers to test and improve its models.\nMoreover, Meta is a leader in AI model transparency. It has developed methodologies to make AI decision-making processes fully interpretable, addressing the \u201cblack box\u201d problem in AI. By pioneering transparency and accountability, Meta is positioning itself as a responsible leader in the AI industry\u2014a critical advantage as AI adoption expands into high-stakes fields such as healthcare and finance.\nMETA Stock\u2019s Valuation\nMeta\u2019s rise in AI, though initially unexpected, is now firmly on the radar of technology investors. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the company is trading near all-time highs. However, what should it be trading at? To value the firm, I first estimate Meta\u2019s full-year 2034 EBITDA at $278.65 billion. Assuming a conservative EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 12.3, reflecting slower growth expectations compared to recent years, Meta\u2019s December 2034 enterprise value would be $3.43 trillion.\nWith a median weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of approximately 8.5% over the past decade, I then discount this forecasted enterprise value back to December 2024, arriving at an intrinsic value of $1.52 trillion. As Meta\u2019s current enterprise value is $1.41 trillion, this implies a modest 7.6% margin of safety for investors.\nStory Continues\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About Meta?\nMeta currently holds a Strong Buy consensus rating on Wall Street, with an average META price target of $662.62, implying 15.4% upside potential. This is based on 40 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell, further supporting my view that Meta is a viable investment option.\nSee more META analyst ratings\nMicrosoft Is Dominating in AI and Is Undervalued\nI\u2019m also highly bullish on Microsoft, which has a commanding presence in cloud-based AI, particularly through its Azure platform. It leads in traditional AI and generative AI adoption, boasting the highest number of new AI customers and generative AI users compared to peers AWS (AMZN) and Google. Microsoft\u2019s leadership is reinforced by its partnership with OpenAI, which has enabled seamless integration of cutting-edge AI technologies into its cloud services.\nUnlike Meta, Microsoft has a clear and direct monetization pathway for its AI capabilities. The company has integrated AI across its product suite, enhancing user experiences with tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is now used by nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies.\nMicrosoft also prioritizes ethical and transparent AI, which is crucial for its focus on high-impact sectors such as healthcare. Its advancements in multimodal medical imaging and AI-driven nursing workflow solutions are significantly improving patient care. Furthermore, Microsoft\u2019s AI initiatives extend into finance, customer service, and defense, as seen through its collaboration with Palantir (PLTR) on AI solutions for Western defense.\nMSFT Stock\u2019s Valuation\nTo value Microsoft, I first estimate its December 2034 EBITDA at $616.8 billion. Applying a conservative EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 20.3\u2014aligned with the midpoint of its 10-year median and five-year average\u2014my forecast for Microsoft\u2019s enterprise value by December 2034 is $12.52 trillion.\nFurthermore, Microsoft\u2019s WACC stands at 9.81%, with equity making up 97.64% and debt accounting for 2.36%. After discounting my December 2034 forecast back to December 2024, I calculate an intrinsic enterprise value of $4.91 trillion. Given Microsoft\u2019s current enterprise value of $3.13 trillion, this represents a substantial 56.91% margin of safety for investors.\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About Microsoft?\nMicrosoft also has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Wall Street, with an average MSFT price target of $496.92, implying 17.35% upside potential. This rating is supported by 26 Buys, three Holds, and no Sells, reinforcing my thesis that Microsoft is an attractive investment opportunity.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nConclusion: Microsoft Is the Better Investment\nWhile both Meta and Microsoft are poised for substantial long-term growth driven by their strategic positions in AI, Microsoft offers the better investment opportunity today due to its superior valuation and monetization strategy. Even if Meta succeeds in developing the most advanced AI models, its ability to monetize these capabilities may be more challenging compared to Microsoft\u2019s established pathways. Given the security and stability that Microsoft provides, I favor buying its stock while holding off on Meta for now.\nDisclosure\nView Comments"

The AI models behind the famous AI assistant have, however, started to attract unwanted attention in recent months. For example, news publication The Guardian has reported that a group of major news organizations in Canada have sued the AI firm for allegedly strip-mining journalism and unjustly enriching itself by using news articles to train the popular ChatGPT software. Per the report, the suit was filed in the superior court of justice in Ontario and calls for punitive damages, a share of profits made by OpenAI from using the articles, and an injunction barring the San Francisco-based company from using any of the news articles in the future.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOpenAI has faced similar suits in recent months but has managed to fight back without incurring financial harm. The latest suit, per the report, includes news platforms like the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Press, the CBC, the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, and Postmedia. The companies want up to C$20,000 in damages for each article used by OpenAI, suggesting a victory in court could be worth billions. As it battles these claims, OpenAI has already signed licensing agreements with a handful of media organizations, including the Associated Press wire service, NewsCorp and Cond\u00e9 Nast.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive \u201ccritical shock\u201d for the country\u2019s fiscal health.\nREAD NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings\nThe Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years.\n\u201cThe use of AI presents the rare \u2014 possibly unique \u2014 opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system\u201d.\nWhile adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists\u2019 outlook on AI and healthcare is \u201ca mix of enthusiasm and despair\u201d.\n\u201cEnthusiasm because there\u2019s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. \u2026 But there\u2019s friction due to regulation, due to incentives \u2014 because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things \u2014 and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities\u201d.\nIn other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in cloud-delivered endpoint and cloud workload protection. On November 27, Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari raised the firm\u2019s price target on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD to $390 from $375 and kept an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on the shares. According to Baird, Crowdstrike has delivered a strong Q3 powered by its growth of Falcon Flex, the company\u2019s definitive AI-native cybersecurity platform. However, some challenges were also highlighted such as extended sales cycles and temporary volatility in ARR/FCF momentum.\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, CrowdStrike Holdings fair value estimate is US$335\nCrowdStrike Holdings' US$348 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\nAnalyst price target for CRWD is US$370, which is 10% above our fair value estimate\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nThe Model\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$1.06b\nUS$1.38b\nUS$1.78b\nUS$2.05b\nUS$2.99b\nUS$3.54b\nUS$4.02b\nUS$4.43b\nUS$4.78b\nUS$5.09b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x28\nAnalyst x30\nAnalyst x21\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 18.26%\nEst @ 13.56%\nEst @ 10.28%\nEst @ 7.98%\nEst @ 6.37%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%\nUS$989\nUS$1.2k\nUS$1.5k\nUS$1.6k\nUS$2.1k\nUS$2.4k\nUS$2.5k\nUS$2.6k\nUS$2.6k\nUS$2.6k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20b\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$5.1b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$122b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$122b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$62b\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$82b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$348, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Discounted Cash Flow November 29th 2024\nThe Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CrowdStrike Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.041. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nExpensive based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nLooking Ahead:\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks.\nUber, the ride-hailing company that has yet to catch onto the AI boom, is reportedly expanding its fleet of gig workers for a new project aimed at AI annotation and data labeling. According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. The report adds that these workers complete projects for internal business units at the ride hailing company but are also serving outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic. The company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the US, Canada, and India, among others.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOver the past few years, even though the firm is yet to launch an eye-catching AI product, it has incorporated AI internally to streamline operations. For example, the AI algorithms of the firm efficiently match riders with drivers to minimize waiting times and maximize driver utilization. These algorithms predict demand, analyze traffic patterns, and estimate trip durations to offer real-time ride assignments. Similarly, the company heavily invests in AI for self-driving car technology.

Analysts were expecting 87 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates.\nShares of CrowdStrike had fallen 5.9% at 1:33 p.m. in New York on Wednesday.\nThe report is the company\u2019s second since a flawed CrowdStrike update crashed millions of devices operating on Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Windows systems. The outage, which unfolded on July 19, disrupted a wide range of industries, including air travel, banks and health care. The company posted sales three months ago that beat expectations, a sign that investors took to mean the global IT outage wouldn\u2019t significantly affect its finances.\nThird-quarter revenue represented a bright spot in Tuesday\u2019s report. Sales for the period came to $1.01 billion, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Profit, excluding some items, was 93 cents a share, compared with the average estimate of 81 cents.\nCrowdStrike also raised its guidance for revenue for the full fiscal year, to $3.92 billion to $3.93 billion. Analysts were expecting $3.9 billion.\nThe company surpassed $4 billion in annual recurring revenue as of Oct. 31, making CrowdStrike \u201cthe fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone,\u201d Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said in the statement.\nThe company excluded roughly $26 million from its annual recurring revenue in the quarter, CrowdStrike Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere said during the earnings call. That came after a distributor in the federal space provided notice of its intention \u201cto exercise transferability rights with respect to a transaction,\u201d and CrowdStrike concluded the transaction wouldn\u2019t recur. That transaction remains in revenue in compliance with US revenue recognition rules, Podbere said.\nCrowdStrike previously agreed to a $32 million deal with Carahsoft Technology Corp., a distributor which serves as a middleman between technology companies and government agencies, for identity protection software intended for the US Internal Revenue Service. But the IRS never purchased the software, Bloomberg reported in October.\nStory Continues\nThe deal caused concern within CrowdStrike and, according to some legal and accounting experts, raised red flags.\nJeremy Fielding, a spokesperson for CrowdStrike, declined to say whether the company\u2019s comments were related to the Carahsoft deal involving the IRS. \u201cOur comments during the Q3 FY 25 earnings call speak for themselves,\u201d he said in an email. Carahsoft didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nDelta Airlines\u2019 operations were stunted for days as a result of the outage, costing the airline at least $500 million in out-of-pocket losses, according to a lawsuit it filed against CrowdStrike in October. CrowdStrike said Delta was shifting blame \u201cfrom its failure to update its antiquated IT infrastructure,\u201d in a statement at the time.\n\u201cFollowing this summer\u2019s incident as a company we were tested,\u201d Kurtz said, in a call with investors on Tuesday. \u201cWe responded with speed, care and resolve and we focused on becoming even better.\u201d\n(Updates shares in third paragraph and with additional information in 10th and 11th paragraph.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stock picks in Brad Gerstner's portfolio.\nGerstner Expects More M&As in New Term\nStrategists and investors are confident that the new administration will fuel the state of mergers and acquisitions in the United States. It is no surprise that renowned investor Brad Gerstner, founder and CEO of\u00a0Altimeter Capital,\u00a0believes the same. On November 6, Gerstner\u00a0appeared in an interview on\u00a0CNBC Television\u00a0where he shared his expectations of the stock market.\nGerstner shares that the Republicans have been particularly critical of big tech companies and their \u201cbundling powers\u201d that happen to \u201ccrowd out startups\u201d and \u201cstifle innovation and startups.\u201d He expects the new administration to scrutinize this trend heavily. He also adds that the true beauty of Silicon Valley lies in the innovation and technology bolstered by small tech and mergers and acquisitions.\nSpeaking of big tech, he suggests that these names have been cutting down on M&A deals and have instead directed their resources to stock repurchases, dividends, and onboarding new GPUs. He expects the new administration to alter the trend and loosen up the ability to do mergers and acquisitions.\nGertsner also suggests that the US market will be better off with a functioning mergers and acquisitions flow in Silicon Valley, which he refers to as the \u201cheartbeat\u201d of the place. He also shared his thoughts on the program, Invest America, which is expected to provide kids with $1,000 in seed money into investment accounts as soon as they are born. He has been working with leading lawmakers in the country to promote the program and is highly optimistic about its outcomes.\nGerstner is bullish on the program and highlighted that the move will bring a new era of enterprise, innovation, and capital management to the US economy. He added that this program will bolster the private market and likely create 3.7 million new stock market investors yearly. In addition to investors like Brad Gerstner, many large tech companies are on board with the program.\nBrad Gerstner is one of the top technology investors and has had many notable transactions over the past few years through his firm. He is bullish on tech and innovation, particularly artificial intelligence. In Q3 2024, he initiated 8 new positions and also raised his stakes in 7 stocks, ending the quarter with a portfolio of $6.75 billion in 13F securities. With that, let\u2019s discuss his top new picks as of Q3 2024.\nStory Continues\nBrad Gerstner Altimeter Capital\nBrad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital\nOur Methodology\nWe scanned Altimeter Capital\u2019s Q3 2024 portfolio and picked new additions from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we\u2019ve also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nAltimeter Capital\u2019s Stake Value: $68,464,388\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks third on our list of the 7 new stock picks by Brad Gerstner. He trimmed his position in NVIDIA slightly and added AVGO to his portfolio. It designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\nThroughout the year, the company has launched crucial breakthrough technology for AI tasks and AI systems. On November 5, the company announced the launch of VeloRain, an AI and ML platform that enhances AI security workloads. On the same day, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) unveiled a private cloud platform, part of its VMware Cloud Foundation, improving AI autonomy and security for its customers.\nAttributable to its growing stakes in AI, the company expects revenue from AI to increase 10% from the previous quarter to reach $3.5 billion. This will bring the full-year total to $12 billion. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) saw a 47% increase in consolidated revenue and a 44% increase in net income.\nAVGO\u2019s performance and growing importance in the AI sector explain why hedge funds are bullish on the stock. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, 128 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of new stock picks in Brad Gerstner's portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "Stocks will enter the final month of 2024 near record highs as investors look to cap off what's been another stellar year for US stocks.\nDuring last week's holiday-shortened trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 2%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended November at all-time highs.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's November jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also scatter the schedule.\nInvestors will look to this week's economic data for clarity on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, which will be announced on Dec. 18.\nIn corporate news, earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Okta (OKTA), and Lululemon (LULU) will highlight the coming week's schedule.\n\u2022 USD\n(^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA labor look-in\nExpectations for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have shifted in recent months.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a 66% chance the Fed cuts rates at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But looking out further, markets are pricing in just two more rate cuts over the next year, with concerns growing about the Fed's progress on bringing down inflation.\nA labor market that continues to slow, but not dramatically, also likely keeps the Fed focused on inflation, which makes a less compelling case for aggressive rate cuts in 2025. An update on that narrative will come with the November jobs report, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nEconomists expect the report to show a reversal of the dismal October employment report that many believed was heavily impacted by hurricanes and worker strikes.\nThe November report is expected to show the US labor market added 200,000 jobs in the month, up from the 12,000 monthly job additions seen in October. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to have inched up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\"Through the monthly swings of nonfarm payrolls, we expect the November employment report to reiterate that while the labor market remains solid in an absolute sense, the softening trend in employment conditions has yet to cease,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients. \"That message is likely to come through more clearly from the unemployment rate, which we look to rise to 4.2%.\"\nStory Continues\n'Magnificent' earnings revisions\nWall Street strategists have been largely bullish when issuing 2025 forecasts, with strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance seeing the S&P 500 ending the year between 6,400 and 7,000. A frequent call in these outlooks has been for a continued broadening of the stock market rally away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 and toward the other 493 stocks in the index.\n\"We\u2019ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it\u2019s a close call,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote, emphasizing that another strong year of economic growth could help support the S&P 493.\nBut not everyone agrees. Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out that Big Tech continues to top earnings estimates each quarter. And as long as that streak continues, Krishna argued \"Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year.\"\nTo Krishna's point, while the broadening is expected to take place throughout next year, earnings revisions remain more positive for many Big Tech names than the rest of the S&P 500.\nIn a research note published on Nov. 27, DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe pointed out that six Big Tech companies have seen earnings revisions for the current quarter come in either flat or higher in the past 30 days. Only Microsoft and Apple have seen their earnings estimates cut more than the S&P 500's 1.2% estimate trim in that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500's 10 largest non-tech companies have seen earnings estimates slashed by an average of 2.7%.\n\"US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings,\" Rabe wrote. \"Fortunately, Big Tech makes up a third of the S&P, so their fundamentals have an outsized impact on the index.\"\nThe case for a strong December\nAnother popular call among strategists has been for the roaring bull market to continue through year-end, with more all-time highs in store before trading wraps up in 2024.\nAnd history supports that argument.\nCarson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that, in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 out of 10 times.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive \u201ccritical shock\u201d for the country\u2019s fiscal health.\nREAD NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings\nThe Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years.\n\u201cThe use of AI presents the rare \u2014 possibly unique \u2014 opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system\u201d.\nWhile adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists\u2019 outlook on AI and healthcare is \u201ca mix of enthusiasm and despair\u201d.\n\u201cEnthusiasm because there\u2019s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. \u2026 But there\u2019s friction due to regulation, due to incentives \u2014 because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things \u2014 and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities\u201d.\nIn other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Broadcom Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $14.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +51.3%. The $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +44% and +16.7%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Rich Valera.\nRichard Valera\nGood afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call to discuss first quarter fiscal year 2025 financial results. Joining me today are Rajiv Ramaswami, Nutanix's President and CEO; and Rukmini Sivaraman, Nutanix's CFO. After the market closed today, Nutanix issued a press release announcing first quarter fiscal year 2025 results. If you'd like to read the release, please visit the press releases section of our IR website.\nDuring today's call, management will make forward-looking statements, including financial guidance. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated by these statements. For a more detailed description of these and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K as well as our earnings press release issued today.\nThese forward-looking statements apply as of today, and we undertake no obligation to revise these statements after this call. As a result, you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Please note, unless otherwise specifically referenced, all financial measures we use on today's call, except for revenue, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided, to the extent available, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures on our IR website and in our earnings press release.\nNutanix is participating in the Raymond James TMT and Consumer Conference in New York on December 10 and the Barclays Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on December 12. We hope to see some of you at these events. Finally, our second quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period will begin on January 18.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nStory Continues\nRajiv Ramaswami\nThank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We are happy to report first-quarter results that came in ahead of our guidance. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership, our TCO.\nTaking a closer look at the first quarter, we exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $591 million. We grew our ARR 18% year over year to $1.966 billion. We also saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in new logos and solid free cash flow generation.\nOur largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to organizations that are looking to modernize their IT footprint, including adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models and modern applications while also managing through disruption from industry M&A.\nOne of our largest wins of the quarter was a full stack expansion with a global provider of IT consulting services based in the APAC region. This existing Nutanix customer expanded with us by shifting more workloads to our cloud platform, and adding additional components of our portfolio, enabling them to increase their automation and self-service capabilities while also reducing their exposure to their other incumbent infrastructure provider. This expansion was also aimed at strengthening their go-to-market practice with Nutanix in the areas of generating AI, modern applications, and competitive migrations.\nAnother notable win in Q1 was a significant expansion with a North American-based Fortune 100 provider of food services and products. This customer was looking to implement a hybrid multi-cloud environment with the intent of running more of their workloads in the public cloud and lowering their total cost of ownership while also reducing their exposure to our largest competitor. They chose the Nutanix Cloud platform, including our Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2, running on AWS, along with Nutanix Cloud Management. This enables them to reduce their projected TCO by nearly 50%, while also consolidating their existing data center footprint.\nOn the product front, we recently announced the general availability of GPT-in-a-Box 2.0, our solution for simplifying the deployment of generative AI applications. A key component of this offering is Nutanix Enterprise AI, or NAI, which helps streamline deployment scaling and running of influencing end points for large language models. NAI can be deployed within GPT-in-a-Box on-prem or at the edge or independently, on native public cloud services, such as AWS, EKS, and Azure AKF. These new capabilities help further our vision of becoming the leading platform for running all apps and managing data anywhere.\nA first-quarter new logo with the government ministry in the EMEA region demonstrated early progress with the new generative AI and modern application capabilities of our platform. This customer was looking to modernize their infrastructure and chose a full stack Nutanix solution to support development and deployment of their cloud-native and generative AI applications. They chose our GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution including our Nutanix Kubernetes Platform and Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure, as well as our Nutanix Unified storage and Nutanix Database Service offerings.\nMoving on, we also continue to make progress on the partnership front, signing an expanded strategic partnership with AWS that will simplify cloud migrations and offer access to AWS services for customers looking to migrate to NC2 on AWS. As part of this collaboration, customers will gain access to promotional credits from AWS to support customer migrations and proof-of-concept trials as well as Nutanix licensing promotions. Customers can also gain access to promotional credits for migrating VMware cloud and AWS workloads to NC2 on AWS through the AWS VMware migration accelerator program.\nFinally, we continue to receive industry recognition in Q1, being named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for distributed hybrid infrastructure, alongside some of the leading public cloud providers, improving from our challenged position in the 2023 Magic Quadrant.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our solid first-quarter results. Our ongoing innovation on our cloud platform, particularly with respect to its support for generative AI and modern applications and on the progress we continue to make on partnerships. We remain focused while driving sustainable, profitable growth.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Rajiv, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will first discuss our Q1 fiscal '25 results, followed by our guidance for Q2 fiscal '25 and an updated outlook for the full fiscal year 2025.\nResults in Q1 '25 came in above the high end of our range across our guided metrics. Revenue in Q1 was $591 million, higher than the guided range of $565 million to $575 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 16%. The outperformance in revenue was driven by good renewals execution. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.966 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%.\nWe saw strength in landing new customers onto our platform, helped by more leverage from our OEM and channel partners from the various programs we have put in place to incentivize new logos and from a general increase in engagement from customers looking at us as an alternative in the wake of industry M&A.\nNRR, or net dollar-based retention rate at the end of Q1 was 110%. Expansion with existing customers was impacted largely by our US federal business for which Q1 is a seasonally strong quarter given their September 30 fiscal year-end. Our US Fed business performance was lower year over year relative to the strong comparison from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to impacts from the elongated continuing resolution resulting in lighter spending from our Fed customers.\nBased on our current view, we expect our US federal business performance to return to more normal levels in the second quarter. In Q1, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels, which we believe is influenced by the macroeconomic environment and continued increased scrutiny on spend. In addition, as discussed during prior earnings calls, we believe the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure.\nThese factors also impact our ARR growth. Average contract duration in Q1 was to 3.1 years flat sequentially quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 87.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 20%, higher than our guided range of 14.5% to 15.5%, largely due to higher revenue and to a smaller extent, due to lower expenses including as a result of certain nonrecurring payments and credits.\nNon-GAAP net income in Q1 was $122 million, of fully diluted EPS of $0.42 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares. GAAP net income and fully diluted GAAP EPS in Q1 were $30 million and $0.10 per share, respectively. Free cash flow in Q1 was $152 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 26%.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalence and short-term investments of $1.075 billion up from $994 million at the end of Q4.\nMoving to capital allocation. We repurchased about $20 million worth of shares in Q1 and used about $79 million of cash in Q1 to retire shares related to our employees' STAC liability for their quarterly RSU vesting.\nMoving to Q2 '25. Our guidance for Q2 is as follows: revenue of $635 million to $645 million; non-GAAP operating margin of 20% to 21%; fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares.\nMoving to the full year. The updated guidance for fiscal year '25 is as follows: revenue of $2.435 billion to $2.465 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 14% at third point and no change from our initial guidance. The non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 16% to 17%, an increase from our previous guidance. Free cash flow of $560 million to $610 million, representing a free cash flow margin of approximately 24% at the midpoint and an increase of $15 million relative to our prior initial guidance at the midpoint.\nI will now provide some commentary and assumptions regarding our updated fiscal year '25 guidance. First, we are seeing continued land-and-expand opportunities and a growing pipeline for our solutions. However, as we have discussed previously, we expect continued uncertainty in the timing, outcome and deal structure from the growing mix of larger deals in the pipeline. And as I mentioned earlier, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels, which we believe is related to the uncertain spending environment and which we expect to continue.\nSecond, the guidance assumes that renewals will continue to perform well in fiscal year '25. Third, the full-year guidance assumes that average contract duration will be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '24 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings.\nFourth, the non-GAAP operating margin guidance assumes incremental prudent investments in sales and marketing and research and development, targeted towards addressing our large market opportunity. Those investments are expected to continue to ramp through the course of the fiscal year.\nFinally, a note on seasonality. Based on our current view of renewal's cohorts and visibility into land and expand, we expect revenue seasonality in fiscal Q3 relative to Q2 to be similar to what we saw in fiscal year '23.\nIn closing, we are pleased that our Q1 performance exceeded the high end of our guidance and would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, investors and stakeholders for their continued trust in us. We remain committed to continued progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth, both through durable top line growth and expanding margins.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Pinjalim Bora, JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora\nRajiv, one for you. Maybe can you talk about what are you hearing from customers around the VMS offering? Trying to understand if this new partnership with AWS. It might act as a catalyst to kind of convince people to move to NC2 or are you seeing any signs of that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nOkay. Pinjalim, Rajiv here. I think you meant VMC on AWS, correct? You said VMS --\nPinjalim Bora\nCorrect. VMC, correct.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nVMC on AWS, correct. Okay. All right. So clearly, I think that seems to be an offering that Broadcom is not focused on as much. And it's created an opportunity for us, for sure, and customers are concerned as to what might happen with their offering.\nFor example, the go cloud version of their offering, garment cloud version was apparently deprecated by Broadcom. So this is one of the impetus for the expanded partnership that we have with AWS, where we are working together with them to provide EVM migration for customers from BMC onto NC2 on AWS. We talked about one of the wins last quarter actually, leading universities that actually went and did exactly that. And anyway. So this is really one of the impetus why AWS is partnering with us.\nThey're offering immigration credit. The migration accelerator program, and we are working together to help customers who might be interested in migrating off that offering on to something else in the public\nPinjalim Bora\nYes. Understood. One for Rukmini. Rukmini, I'm trying to understand the guidance. It seems like a very solid Q1 beat.\nYou took the Q2 numbers up, but the second half seems like it's an implied guide down because you didn't take the full year number up. So I'm trying to understand, is that just prudent caution around what you're seeing on the sales cycles, Were there any deals that mkind of moved from the second half into the first half that changed the seasonality a bit? And lastly, do you think we're close to a trough on NRR?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Pinjalim. Both good questions. I'll start with your revenue guidance first. So yes, we were happy with our Q1 revenue performance, but we are only one quarter into fiscal year. And given the uncertain environment, including that related to a new administration in the US, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year top-line guide until we have a better view of how the rest of the year is going to play out.\nAnd as I noted in my prepared remarks, we continue to see these modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. And we believe that the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions, more approvals and causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in deal structure outcome and timing.\nAnd finally, from a seasonality perspective, we've historically seen a fairly even split in revenue between the first half and second half of the fiscal year. So our current expectations aren't that different from what we've seen historically.\nSo that's on the revenue top-line guidance question, Pinjalim. I think your second part of the question was around NRR. So a few things on NRR. First, I will say that given that our GRR, while we don't disclose it, we've said in the past that it has not changed significantly relative to recent levels. So given that, the largest driver of net new ARR is land and expand ACV, right?\nAnd your question specifically is on which does not, for example, benefit from the strength that we saw in our land. So I want to first start by clarifying that. And we did see some divergence there between sort of the strength in our land performance.\nNow with respect to expand, with existing customers, expand accounts for the majority of our land and expand, which was impacted largely by our US Fed business, which was lower year over year relative to the strong compare we had from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to the CR and the continuing resolutions in the US. And so all the dynamics you talked about in large sales cycle, larger deal sizes, various sales cycles or that does impact expand as well, Pinjalim. So that all did go into the NRR number.\nNow I think your question was around, is this the -- is this -- have we hit sort of the low point for NRR. We don't guide to NRR, as you know. But we do expect that and will be impacted by some of these factors that we've talked about like the sales cycles and the mix of large deals when we expect some of that to continue.\nSo that, we believe is the case, but we don't explicitly guide to NRR.\nOperator\nMeta Marshall, Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall\nGreat. Maybe following up on the federal piece. You noted in the script that you expected kind of fiscal Q2 to be better. I would expect you would need the administration change, so maybe you wouldn't expect kind of federal to improve until fiscal Q3, but just wanted to kind of listen about what went into that commentary or you could explain that more. And then maybe just a second question.\nJust any update on timing of Dell PowerFlex kind of integration? Just anything there would be helpful.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo Meta, on the federal question, I mean, we don't have visibility in terms of what the new administration is going to do or not do. So we can't really talk about what's going to happen after the new agitation comes in. So we have a near-term view on Q2, of course, which we factored in. And that's why we feel comfortable about our federal business coming back to more normal levels in Q2 based on what we know today. And of course, we'll have to see what the new administration does after they come on board.\nNow on the Dell question, specifically. So as you know, Meta, there's two parts to the Dell relationship. One is the existing hyper-converged solution that we have, which will be an appliance sale by combining our software on their service. That's been in the market now this quarter, and it's still early days for that.\nYour question on PowerFlex. We expect to have that in the market in the first half of calendar '25, and we expect to see some revenue contribution from it in FY26.\nOperator\nJim Fish, Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish\nI did want to build off of Meta's question and Pinjalim there a little bit. Can you just remind us how big this federal vertical can be for you guys here in fiscal Q1 versus kind of what you saw here? And what the actual impact net retention rate was? Like are we talking about a point or two difference that we would have seen versus the 110% or how to kind of quantify that?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nI'll take that, Jim. So First, on quantification of Fed, we don't disclose that, Jim. But as you can imagine and we've said this before, that for our Q1 is typically the seasonally strongest quarter given it's also the federal year-end, which covers September 30. So we don't disclose that number, Jim, but that is Q1 is our strongest Fed quarter. And similarly, right, we're not going to break out NRR impact by Fed or by any other sort of segmentation at this point.\nBut we did see the fact that overall Fed and expand specifically was lower than last year. It was a challenge for us in Q1 relative to what we saw last Q1, which was a strong one to compare.\nJames Fish\nGot it. And Rajiv, maybe for you. I think we're all kind of anxious to hear about when we could see more stand-alone into other storage arrays. Obviously, you just talked about the calendar first half of '25 seeing Dell PowerFlex. But how should we start thinking about Nutanix's relationships of getting stand-alone AHV integration into some of the other providers out there?\nAnd why we wouldn't start to see that AHV attach go from 7% today to faster to 100?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I think those are two different questions there, Jim. I think on the first question, clearly, the only one that we've announced so far has been Dell PowerFlex relationship. As you can imagine, we do have plans to expand that selectively to other storage arrays over time. I'm not going to preannounce anything right now, but you can assume that we are working on that in a very careful way. At the same time, we also want to make sure that whatever we do is actually focusing on expanding the market opportunity for us and doesn't cannibalize the existing HCI opportunity.\nSo we are focused specifically on working with storage array vendors that are workloads that would not necessarily be easier to capture with HCI because the workload we can capture with our own HCI platform, we would like to do that at the full stack.\nAnd over time, even for those that we do go in our goal is to sell the full stack over time. So stay tuned. I mean, we, of course, will continue to explore other options in the market when it comes to other storage arrays. And you can -- we don't have any more to say at this point. But the idea is to start with Dell and then over time expand to others.\nWith respect to your question on AHV penetration. Again, I think our philosophy has always been we support multiple hypervisors. And there's been a natural cadence to buy which the AHV adoption has continued to grow, and we are still at where it is. I don't necessarily need it to be 100%, frankly, but our goal is to increase the AHV footprint because we also want to be able to insert into VMware accounts, where our platform is running on top of ESX, the VMware hypervisor, and we'll continue to support that going forward as well.\nBut we would, of course, like to see more and more customers start to migrate over to our ASV footprint. And having, of course, this third-party storage support will only help amplify that.\nOperator\nJason Ader, William Blair.\nJason Ader\nSo when I look at the second half and you gave basically guidance revenue per quarter for the second half. But then looking at the operating margin for the year, you raised that only slightly after having pretty significant outperformance in Q1 and also guiding to a pretty robust operating margin in Q2. So that implies the second half is going to be kind of weigh down on the operating margin.\nAnd I know you said you're going to be ramping expenses, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing kind of idiosyncratic to the second half that we're not thinking about. And then can you talk about where that ramp up in spending is going to come. You said sales and marketing and R&D, but could you be more specific within those buckets.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nJason, first, on operating margin. So you're correct. So first, I'll start with revenue. What we said was -- I think in response to an earlier question, that our implied revenue split, first half to second half is roughly even based on the -- and that's similar to our historical patterns. While we expect operating expenses on the other hand, to grow over the course of the year, much like it did last fiscal year.\nSo to your point, you're correct that we will expect to see lower operating margins in the second half of the year and fiscal year '25. However, overall, we still expect to see year-over-year improvement in operating margin for the full fiscal year relative to fiscal year '24. And then to the second part of your question on where are we spending those dollars.\nSo first, in R&D, we have talked about investing, for example, in these AHV standalone to support the stand-alone storage arrays. So that's one area of R&D investment. Some other examples include we have ramped up our offerings around cloud native or containerized applications. That's another area generative AI plus our core enterprise platform, right, to the platform and making sure that it continues to evolve. So even within our core platforms, there are innovations that we continue to drive.\nSo that's on the R&D side, some examples of where we're investing.\nOn the sales and marketing side, we have talked about some investments we've made -- some we made last year and some will continue into this year, for example, around product specialist sellers, folks who are focused on selling our entire portfolio and helping our main field sellers go do that. We have increased some investments around the channel as another example, some inside sales folks who can be focused on driving both expansion and land around the more mid-market tiers. So those are some examples of areas that we're investing in both sales and marketing and in R&D.\nOperator\nWamsi Mohan, Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nIt's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Rukmini, the renewals business has been strong. How should we think about the growth in available to renew pool in fiscal '25 versus fiscal '24? And is there any danger that renewals kind of fall off a cliff in fiscal '26? Or is there a large enough cohort of customers who are going to renew in fiscal '26 that strong growth in renewals continues and it grows as a mix of the business.\nSo just your thoughts on available to renew pool and how you see that business continuing to grow?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. So you're correct that we did talk about renewals doing well for Q1. In terms of ATR for full year fiscal year '25, I think we referred to this in our last earnings call when we gave you all the initial guide for fiscal year '25. Available to the new pool or ATR is expected to grow nicely in '25 year over year versus '24, and we'll continue to grow quite nicely over the next few years, Ruplu. So I'm not going to give you a quantification for fiscal year '26 at this point.\nWe're still only one quarter into '25. But yes, we expect that growth in available to renew for our renewal cohorts to continue for the next couple of years.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nOkay. And maybe for my follow-up, I'll ask you another question. Free cash flow in fiscal 1Q was very strong. It was $152 million, which I don't think, over the last three, four years, you've had such a strong 1Q. Were there any one-time items?\nI know last quarter, you had said that you might get from a partner, I think you had said $30 million benefit for the full year in terms of free cash flow. So any guidance on how we should think about the progression of free cash flow first half versus second half in this year?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. We were happy with our free cash flow performance in Q1, as you alluded to. So nothing significant, I would call out as onetime. So you're right, those partner payments, we did call out for fiscal year '25 and those will continue to come in. They might be a little inconsistent in terms of quarter to quarter, but we're not breaking that out quarterly, Ruplu.\nThere wasn't any one thing I would call out. For example, in Q4, in our July quarter, we did call out there was one significant deal that we collected in that quarter. For example, there was nothing like that, that I would call out for Q1. And more generally, I think when you think about just, I think rest of the year, part of your question is $152 million was a strong Q1, and our full-year guide is $560 million to $610 million. And so I'll just remind you that, one, expenses are going up, expected to go up through the rest of the year.\nSo keep that in mind, right, those expenses will ramp over the course of the year, much like they did last fiscal year. So that in. And we do collect multiple years of cash from our customers typically upfront. And so that does mean that depending on duration or depending on some larger deals, there can be some variation quarter to quarter in that number, which is why we continue to guide for free cash flow really on an annual basis only.\nOperator\nMike Cikos, Needham.\nMichael Cikos\nI'm going to ask a boring one on guidance and build on some of the line of questioning that Mr. Rader was going after on the operating margin and the operating profit. But I just wanted to get a better understanding congratulations on the 20% operating margin we're seeing here in Q1.\nIs the view for full year in any way informed like are we potentially behind on hiring versus where we expected to be exiting Q1? Or are you potentially increasing your view of additional investments in sales and marketing and R&D? Because I know that's something that we had flagged on the previous quarter. Just wanted to wrestle those two items.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Mike. Always welcome the boring question on the guide. So thank you for that. Not at all boring, actually. It's very, very practical.\nSo when we think of spend and our planning cycles, Mike. So we're coming out of our planning cycle. And so as we deploy this, again, similar to last fiscal year, some of this will be ramping over the course of the year. So that is in the plan. And so you'll continue to see that this year relative to last year, right?\nSo there's nothing unusual or different necessarily that I would call out other than, of course, as we hire people in Q1 or Q2, they might be there for partially for that quarter. But then for the next quarter, they're there for the full quarter, right? So there is that almost normalization that happened over the course of the year. And so that's what's baked into the op margin guide for the full year relative to what you saw in Q1.\nMichael Cikos\nGot it. And then just one other, if I could. I know that we're -- and I appreciate the commentary here as well as far as the Q2 versus 3Q seasonality on revenue. I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about this properly, even if I go back beyond last year, two years ago, we tend to see coal at a 7% to 8%, 7% feels about right as far as a sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3. And I appreciate your qualitative comments, but if you could further elaborate on that.\nWhat is driving that seasonal component? Is it really tied to year-end in Q2 and then maybe the sales incentive comp for your sales force in Q4? Is that why we should be thinking about that Q2 to Q3 sequential movements that we're talking to?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nYou're exactly right, Mike. So historically, if you look at our performance, Q2 and Q4 tend to be seasonally stronger quarters from a top line perspective, exactly for the recency outline because Q2 has the December year-end. And Q4 had our end of fiscal year, and therefore, some sales incentives tied to a strong finish there. What has happened also is as we now have the renewal cohorts layering in, they tend to follow similarly the land expand performance in the past because they're just reflective of deals that were signed and when those renewals view.\nSo now we have the impact of historical land and expand, but the renewal cohorts are also following that pattern. So we just wanted to remind folks of that going into Q3 and give you a sense of qualitatively, what to expect relative to the Q2 guidance.\nOperator\nBen Bollin, Cleveland Research Company.\nBen Bollin\nRajiv, I wanted to get your perspective a bigger picture on enterprise refresh behavior, in particular, around how you see customers evolving around three-tier versus HCI? Any thoughts on the pace and rate of enterprise on-prem AI deployments?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I'll take those two questions separately. I don't think Ben that much has changed with respect to three-tier versus HCI. We still continue to validate the proposition of 40% -- 40% to 50% lower TCO if you replace your three-tier with SCI and it also provides you the platform to really expand into becoming a hybrid cloud, which is what companies want. And so over time, I do expect to continue to see HCI gain into the legacy three-tier offering. So that part hasn't really changed.\nThe dynamics really haven't changed. Of course, it's usually tied to a hardware refresh cycle because that's when you refresh your storage arrays. And instead of refreshing storage here is what we tell customers when they just buy simple servers and put HCI on it. So no change really on that front.\nOn enterprise AI, what we see again is that the bulk of the spend so far have been not really in the enterprise, but in these large hyperscalers as they build out these massive clusters to train these large language models with huge investments from a small handful of very large providers. So we see that for sure.\nNow within the enterprise, most enterprises are, I would say, in the early stages of deploying Generative AI, largely for RAG relative long into generation and fine-tuning and inferencing. They're not going to train these models. They're going to use models that are pre-existing and then use them to drive inferencing but more cost-effective, smaller clusters. We think that, that segment of the market is in early stages. We have seen the first set of applications come about.\nEven this quarter, as you know, we talked about this government customer in EMEA that's starting to use our GPT 2.0 offering. I would say most enterprises are in the early stages of adoption, including ourselves, where we're targeting to see things like a 25% productivity gain for our developers, our improvements in how we manage legal contracts. So companies looking at fraud detection. These are the kind of use cases that we're starting to see emerge. But I would say it's in the early days.\nMost enterprises are only now getting into the act of trying to build these applications. And I do think that this space is going to continue to grow over the next few years, but it's still largely incubation at this point in the enterprise.\nBen Bollin\nThat's great. And Rukmini, if I could. In the past, you had provided some perspective on the growth of $1 million-plus deals in your pipeline relative to the remainder of the business. Curious if you have any updates on that metric exiting the quarter?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ben. I will say we are continuing to see nice growth in our pipeline, including for the larger deals that we've talked about before, Ben, we're not updating those metrics specifically on a quarterly basis. But yes, we are seeing continued interest and engagement and growth in pipeline from those $1 million-plus sort of cohorts and more generally.\nOperator\nSimon Leopold, Raymond James.\nVictor Chiu\nThis is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to drill into your commentary around the increased customer engagement from VMware Basin. Maybe help us understand if this was an incremental acceleration relative to what you were previously observing? If so, maybe help us understand what's driving that and if you expect that to continue?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo, Victor, the market continues to be dynamic. But from our perspective, it's still largely unchanged in terms of our opportunity, a multiyear opportunity to gain share. So we haven't seen a significant change in that this quarter compared to the last several quarters really. And we haven't seen any real meaningful changes in our win-loss rate size around these opportunities. I'll say what we've already said before, right, a lot of these deals are tied to VMware customers, their ELA renewal cycles.\nThey try to when the installed base is coming up for a hardware refresh, although we are also expanding our ability to capture -- to have our solutions work on existing hardware like, for example, the three-tier work that we're doing with Dell or like continuing to be able to deploy our software on already existing BMS HCI customers. And of course, it's a dynamic market in the sense that sometimes we see aggressive behavior from Broadcom as well to keep those customers especially the very large ones. So really, I would say, net-net, nothing much has changed.\nVictor Chiu\nOkay. And if the organization decides that they wanted to move away from VMware kind of, on average, how long is that transition typically? And kind of what are the steps involved that required for a customer to do something like that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nCorrect. It depends on the scale and complexity of their deployment. So if they are -- for example, I'll give you the two bookends. So on the small -- on the easy side, if they are just largely the say, vSphere customer and they're willing to replace their hardware. It's a very easy migration.\nWe can migrate that within a month or two off a relatively small scale. A lot of that is automated as well. Same goes for public cloud to public cloud. And there was a question earlier about VMS Cloud on AWS. Those offerings are actually very easy to migrate.\nAgain, this in a month, we can have those customers off and on to a tan offer. But at the other end of the spectrum are these large customers that use multiple VMware products with massive estates. And there, it can be many years. It can be three years to do a migration. Just because they can't migrate all of it at once, there is a requirement for a professional services engagement to convert over some of their more complex custom scripts, they have return on customer investments they've made on top of the VMS portfolio.\nSo those migrations tend to be complex, require professional services and take a few years. So there's an entire spectrum across those.\nVictor Chiu\nDo you have maybe kind of a general ballpark kind of estimation of what percentage is the easy kind of low-hanging fruit? And what --?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I would say if you look at -- with the exception of, I think, if you go to a large Tier 1 big global accounts, those are the ones that are difficult, right? The vast majority of the smaller customers are going to be more on the easy side.\nOperator\nMatt Hedberg, RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg\nI just wanted to ask, obviously, it sounds like the federal business had some headwinds. Maybe just a simple question, but Rajiv, did the enterprise business, do you think it deteriorated from a demand perspective versus last quarter? Just because it seems like good revolve, but just trying to get a kind of finer point on sort of like your thought on enterprise spending today versus maybe many days ago?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. Matt, clearly, we saw the softness in Fed for sure. We saw it -- that was a very clear cut. The broader enterprise, I we've actually, again, been doing quite well at landing new logos and people migrating. But of course, some of that is perhaps due to just what's happening with the Broadcom situation.\nSo we haven't seen a decline in enterprise spend or less willingness to spend. What we have seen, and we've been talking about this in multiple quarters, Matt, is lot more inspection going on the Fed and a lot more approvals being required higher in the food chain, looking at TCO more carefully, which, of course, plays to our benefit in some articles what we talk about in this environment is how we can reduce TCO.\nSo that dynamic has been going on now for several quarters. We haven't seen much of a change. So net-net, I have to say it for the broader enterprise demand, we haven't seen a change this quarter compared to the prior quarters.\nMatthew Hedberg\nGot it. That's very clear. And then maybe another sort of, I guess, macro question for Rukmini. Obviously, it's not your year-end, but do you typically see a December budget flush from an enterprise percent? I can't imagine you're baking that into guidance.\nJust kind of curious on historically, do you see customers kind of spend it or lose it mentality when it comes to December, your calendar year end?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nI mean certainly, sometimes, right? I mean they may have a budget that's available for this year. We've seen that in the past. We probably will see some of that this year as well, right? I mean I think they do have -- I mean, if your company is on that calendar cycle, yes, you probably will have some budget to spend -- but again, I would not say we factor whatever we can see into our guide for Q2.\nSo nothing really different this year compared to prior years. And so typically, we see a seasonal increase in Q2 compared to Q1. And that's driven in part by the fact that what you alluded to, Matt, but people spending at the end of the year.\nOperator\nGeorge Wang, Barclays.\nI just had two quick ones. Firstly, can you kind of double-click in terms of the channel incentives in place kind of what has changed versus three months ago in terms of providing the promo and the incentives to the channel, especially at the backdrop of for maybe overlapping Nutanix or VMware contract?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean this is a few months ago that we made the change, no recent changes, by the way, on the channel side. We made that going a while ago. But what we did, we did a couple of things there, Joe. First thing we did was we took a subset of our customer base, our target prospects and handed them off entirely to the channel to go drive.\nAnd so we don't have our reps on those accounts. We leave it to the channel, and we provided more incentives to those channel partners to bring us business. So we have incentives in place for our channel partners to bring new logos to us in terms of rewards that they will get more rewards when they bring new logos to us. We are also committed to the channel in the sense that all our deals go through the channel partners. So we're not trying to work around them or shut them out of any of the deals.\nAnd so we've seen, certainly, as a result of all of that, a significant increase in channel partner engagement with us over the last year or two. Some of it is, of course, just what they're seeing with Broadcom, more child partners coming to us, some of it is our own incentives that we are offering for them.\nAnd we also have incentives for the end customer as well, right? So for example, to help them tide over migrations, we can offer them free licenses for a period of time to help them while they're still spending money on VMware to get going on our products until they're ready to go migrate fully over.\nOkay. Just a follow-up, if I can. Just in terms of repatriation, just as kind of a theme, which benefits on Nutanix. Just curious if anything has changed on the repenetration, any additional data points versus last quarter?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. In terms of cloud repatriation, I would say we haven't seen like a massive repatriation of workloads coming back from the public cloud. We see some of that here and there, right? That's where I would characterize it not has changed compared to past quarter. But I think what we see is, again, I can see there is people are much more careful about what they go put in the cloud.\nSo keep in mind that the vast majority of enterprise workloads are still on-prem, not in the public cloud. And now CIOs are being more circumspect about what to use the public cloud for. For example, there's a realization that if we have steady-state workloads, those workloads can be run more efficiently on-prem than in the public cloud. And so this CIO of therefore saying, well, I'm going to keep that workload on-prem. I'm not going to move that to the public cloud.\nSo that's what we are seeing.\nOperator\nNehal Chokshi, Northland Capital Markets.\nNehal Chokshi\nCongrats on the really strong new logo up to 2% year-over-year. That's really impressive. I'm trying to put though, why is ARR decelerating given the strong land that you're seeing? And then if I look at the incremental ARR, i.e., the change quarter-over-quarter or October quarter, relative to the year ago quarter, that was down a lot as well. So thoughts on why are there such a weak incremental ARR characteristics, especially given the backdrop that you're having such strong WAN metrics?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nNehal, thank you. So a few things to -- I'll start with on your point about net new ARR. So One of the biggest drivers of net new ARR, which is simply, as you pointed out, the difference between ARR in this quarter versus the prior quarter is land and expand ACV. And given that our GRR has not changed significantly relative to recent historical levels. And so when you think about land and expand, we did see some divergence, as you point out in the performance of the land versus the expand portion of our business.\nSo we saw strength in the new customers. And we've talked about why that is. And so really happy with that performance.\nExpansion with existing customers, which actually accounts for the majority of the land and expand was impacted largely by our US federal business, Nihal, and we've talked about why we believe that will be the case. And so -- and overall, by the way, right, we've talked about these larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline which are taking longer to close and have data variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. So all of those factors also do impact our ARR growth. So that's how to think about just ARR and net new ARR.\nOperator\nMichael, Wells Fargo.\nI'll ask one on behalf of Aaron. I just want to ask about GPT 2.0 or GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution. I'm just curious, as you think about, I guess, the positioning of that in the marketplace relative to kind of a full stack or a three-tier architecture with NVIDIA's AI enterprise software suite. How do these differ in terms of where they sit in the market that I guess do you see opportunity to maybe move up market as these solutions mature going forward?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean some of that is also a difference between training and inferencing. We are largely with GPT-in-a-Box focused on influencing, focusing on smaller clusters, not massive compute funds to our trade models. Smaller clusters that enterprises can use to deploy more cost-effective AI inferencing applications. I'll give you one example.\nWe, for example, one of our first use cases in Nutanix internally, was a customer service use case where incoming service request from a customer support ticket, the support engineer actually has a natural language into search interface through which they enter the query and then we look through all-on-one basis to try and accelerate our -- the ability to answer that issue. And that AI application is running on just a small cluster, okay, leaving an open source large language model.\nAnd that's the kind of upstarting on GPT-in-a-Box internally. And that's the kind of use case that we're enabling for the enterprise, where you have your secure data, you want to do your inferencing on it, using existing models that are already pretrained, but fine-tuned with your use cases. So that's a cost-optimized solution.\nAnd by the way, we are partnered with NVIDIA on that because we work with the immediate inferencing solution as well as, of course, using their GPUs to do all the hard work needed here. So again, I just think we want to distinguish between influencing on small clusters, which is mostly what we do versus training of very large clusters.\nThat's helpful. And if I can sneak one more in. Just as we think about an improving sort of traditional server end demand environment and as we think about refresh cycles. Obviously, that presents an insertion opportunity for you guys within three-tier architecture. So I'm curious with the new partnerships with Dell and Cisco.\nHave you seen your win rates at all changing? Or do you anticipate those improving given your kind of broader ability to enter those deals?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. First of all, I think I think Cisco and Dell selling our products is, of course, positive for us. And Cisco has been a good contributor to our new logos this quarter as well as last quarter. That is still, I think, very early days for us. And that's independent of the server refresh cycle or not, right?\nSecond, I would say, with respect to refresh cycles, yes, server refreshes will help, but also storage of freshers are important, right? Because that's when we get the opportunity to displace those three-tier architectures with HCI footprint. So both matter. I think having Dell and Cisco as friends in the market, of course, significantly helps. And at the same time, the refresh cycles -- more so, I would say storage or fresh and server refresh will help us insert HCI into existing deployments.\nOperator\nThank you, and thanks for participating. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on December 12, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.39, reflecting a 25.23% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $14.06 billion, indicating a 51.29% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Broadcom Inc. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Broadcom Inc. is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Broadcom Inc. is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.85. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 35.5.\nMeanwhile, AVGO's PEG ratio is currently 1.63. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Electronics - Semiconductors industry stood at 1.77 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 144, putting it in the bottom 43% of all 250+ industries.\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.\nDespite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.\nFirst, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.\nSecond, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.\nFinally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.\nGiven these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks Now.\nOaktree Capital\u2019s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of\u00a0Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.\nMarks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.\nMarks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.\nOn geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.\nThe financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.\n8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nA close up of a circuit board, its microchips creating a powerful computing system.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024.

Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.42%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.83%.\nThe the stock of maker of software that automates companies' technology operations has risen by 11.62% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.44% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.11%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of ServiceNow in its upcoming earnings disclosure.

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.96 billion, up 21.28% from the prior-year quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.87 per share and revenue of $10.97 billion. These totals would mark changes of +28.66% and +22.33%, respectively, from last year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for ServiceNow should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 30.22 for its industry.\nWe can also see that NOW currently has a PEG ratio of 3.05. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Computers - IT Services industry stood at 2.82 at the close of the market yesterday.\nStory Continues\nThe Computers - IT Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 39, which puts it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

(NYSE:NOW) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$4.16b\nUS$5.10b\nUS$5.77b\nUS$6.93b\nUS$7.78b\nUS$8.51b\nUS$9.14b\nUS$9.68b\nUS$10.2b\nUS$10.6b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x24\nAnalyst x16\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 12.25%\nEst @ 9.36%\nEst @ 7.34%\nEst @ 5.92%\nEst @ 4.93%\nEst @ 4.24%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%\nUS$3.9k\nUS$4.5k\nUS$4.7k\nUS$5.3k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\nStory Continues\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$11b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$253b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$253b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$130b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$182b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$1.0k, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNYSE:NOW Discounted Cash Flow November 29th 2024\nImportant Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ServiceNow as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.042. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for ServiceNow\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nMoving On:\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +9.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share, indicating a change of +15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)\nWhat a fantastic six months it\u2019s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is NOW a Good Business?\nFounded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.\n1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nServiceNow\u2019s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters,\u00a0its year-on-year growth averaged\u00a024.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nSell-side analysts expect ServiceNow\u2019s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nServiceNow\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate\nServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\nStory Continues\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on ServiceNow, and with the recent rally, the stock trades at 17.6x forward price-to-sales (or $1,055 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than ServiceNow\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we\u2019re here to help you pick them.\nGet started by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like United Rentals (+550% five-year return).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

These platforms are expanding the company\u2019s abilities in the IT market.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) bulls believe the company\u2019s organic revenue growth after fiscal 2025 could clock in between 20% to 22%.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAs the \u201cAI arms race\u201d continues to evolve, countries are increasingly beginning to realize the efforts they need to expend to stay relevant. One such country in the picture that\u2019s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Updates You Can\u2019t Miss This Weekend and Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight\nThe remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do \"everything they can to lock their digital doors\" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\"While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it\".\nMcFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.\nIn other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.\nThe search, which started on November 1st\u00a0took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it \u201ccannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs\u2019 copied articles were used to build [OpenAI\u2019s] models\u201d.\nStory Continues\n\u201cNews plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week\u2019s worth of its experts\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today\u201d.\nOpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.\nOn November 25, Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and a $1,150.00 price target. Key factors noted during a recent investor meeting have led to this buy rating. A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities. Another factor adding to the positive outlook is the disciplined approach to Pro Plus (the company's new generative AI SKU) pricing. The pressure on the Subscription Gross Margin in the coming year has already been factored into the analysis.\nOverall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nWhat's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?\nServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nCan we expect growth from ServiceNow?\nNYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nIf you'd like to know more about ServiceNow as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.\nThe company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.\nHard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage\nThe rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.\nApproximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.\nSome of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.\nOur bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft\u2019s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.\nCarahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn\u2019t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company\u2019s future relations with the government.\nIn a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.\nThis also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn\u2019t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock\u2019s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow ranks 24th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 97 hedge fund portfolios held NOW at the end of the second quarter which was 90 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.\nOn November 18, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) announced that it has expanded its strategic alliance with Microsoft. Building on their existing partnership, Service Now\u2019s Now Assist and Microsoft 365 Copilot integration will now enable streamlined workflows and enable self-service capabilities within Microsoft applications. In essence, the strategic alliance will help modernize front-office business processes. Copilot will simplify tasks through intelligent automation, while ServiceNow AI agents will manage workflows and offer solutions to complex problems.\n\u201cA strong partnership between ServiceNow and Microsoft means customers gain the best of both worlds: seamless, secure, and smart workflows. By combining our strengths, we're enabling organizations to harness AI and automation in ways that fundamentally change how they work\u2014reducing complexity, driving productivity, and helping teams move faster.
