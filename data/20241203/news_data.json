          "whole_article": "Anti-immigrant rioting broke out across the UK after three girls were killed at a dance class in Southport this summer - Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\nFacebook posts calling immigrants \u201cscum\u201d will be investigated by the tech giant\u2019s oversight board in the wake of the Southport riots.\nThe board, which monitors Facebook\u2019s moderation decisions, said it would examine three posts that attacked immigrants and Muslims after its safety checks initially failed to remove them.\nOne post called for mosques to be smashed and buildings torched where \u201cscum are living\u201d and justified the riots as the only way to stop \u201call the scum coming into Britian [sic]\u201d.\nThe second post included an image, generated by artificial intelligence (AI), of a giant man with a Union Jack T-shirt chasing several Muslim men with the phrase \u201cEnough is enough\u201d.\nA third included an AI image of four Muslim men in front of Parliament chasing a crying toddler in a Union Jack T-shirt. Behind them, a plane flies towards Big Ben.\n\u2018Maximum protection\u2019 to free expression\nAll three images were reported to Facebook but initially left online by its automated software. The tech giant has since removed the first post, but argued the second and third images did not violate its hate speech rules.\nThe oversight board, whose members include Alan Rusbridger, former Guardian editor, said Meta had argued it had erred in favour of offering \u201cmaximum protection\u201d to free expression.\nThe watchdog, which was set up by Mark Zuckerberg in 2020, is able to offer policy recommendations to Meta, although these are not binding.\nThe board said it planned to investigate the \u201cpreparedness and crisis response to violent riots targeting migrant and Muslim communities\u201d. It would also examine the \u201crole social media played in the 2024 UK riots, including the spread of misinformation, in organising riots and informing the public of relevant developments\u201d.\nAnti-immigrant rioting broke out across the UK after three girls were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport this summer.\nRioters attacked Muslim businesses and hotels holding asylum seekers.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has charged 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time of the incident, with the killings as well as a terror charge for alleged possession of a military study of an Al-Qaeda training manual and a charge under the Biological Weapons Act. He is due to go on trial next year and has not entered a plea.\nThe knife attack itself has not been judged a terrorist incident by police.\nDozens of arrests for racists posts\nIn the wake of the knife attack, far-Right groups used social media to organise violent protests.\nThere have since been dozens of arrests of people who shared racist posts or called for violence against Muslims. In August, a woman was jailed for 15 months for writing a post urging people to \u201cblow up the mosques\u201d.\nStory continues\nMPs have tried to summon Elon Musk to account for the role of X in the spreading of disinformation during the riots. Mr Musk claimed in a post on X to his 200m followers that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d in the UK, prompting condemnation from Sir Keir Starmer.\nChi Owurah, chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, said last month: \u201cThe violence we saw on UK streets this summer has shown the dangerous real-world impact of spreading misinformation and disinformation across social media.\u201d\nA Facebook spokesman said: \u201cDuring the UK riots we activated our crisis policy protocol \u2013 which we developed in response to a prior recommendation from the oversight board \u2013 and deployed dedicated teams to remove violating content and engage directly with local authorities.\n\u201cWe welcome the oversight board\u2019s guidance in these cases and will implement their decisions once they have finished deliberating.\u201d"

(NASDAQ:META) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks.\nKen Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors.\nFisher said, \"I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused.\"\nBesides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors.\nIn the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips.\nREAD ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams\u2019 Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks.\nEven though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better.\n\"Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly,\" Ken Fisher said.\nKen Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the \"magnificent seven\" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions.\nStory Continues\n\"If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward\", Fisher said in a video interview.\nOur Methodology\nWe looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm's stake at the end of Q3 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nFisher Asset Management\u2019s Equity Stake: $3.76 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes: 235\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a communication service company that develops products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family. As the owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, the company generates 98% of its revenues from digital advertising. Likewise, the company's core digital advertising business is booming amid a resilient economy on lower interest rates.\nOn October 30, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its third-quarter results. The company made $40.59 billion in revenue, up 19% from last year. Its operating margin increased to 43%. User engagement grew, with 3.29 billion daily active users across its apps, a 5% rise. The average ad price also went up by 11%.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is putting more money into generative AI with its large language model, Llama. This is part of their plan to make their apps more engaging. More engagement means more advertisers, which leads to more ad revenue. Analysts expect Meta's earnings to grow at an annual rate of 25% and revenue by 16% from 2023 to 2026. The growth will come from their apps, which have 3.29 billion daily users, and new augmented and virtual reality products.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 12th on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

It could further help improve internet connectivity to some unserved and underserved communities. It is believed to form a W beginning with the East Coast of the United States, South to Cape Town in Africa, to Mumbai and Chennai in India, Darwen in Australia, and then up the West Coast of the United States. According to sources, it could become operational by 2025. However, some say there could be a delay for some reasons, including high demand for cable laying ships given that they are already booking up as far as the middle of the next decade.\nThis ambitious project complements others like Google, which have engaged in subsea cable investment to boost service provision and respond to connectivity issues. Just as Meta seeks to reinforce its worldwide connections, its multi-billion-dollar gamble on subsea pipelines might alter the world's digital infrastructure, but it still exposes the company to the risk of cost escalation or excessive regulation.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\nAnother factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nMeta Platforms' Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.\nMeta Platforms is the world\u2019s largest social media platform. The company\u2019s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta\u2019s family of products used by almost 3.24 billion people on a daily basis as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nHeadquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $134.9 billion in 2023. Advertisement accounted for 97.8% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.\n\nMeta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.\n\nMeta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).\n\nMeta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.\n\nInstagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.\n\nMessenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way.\n\nMeta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division.\nStory Continues\nBottom Line\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Meta Platforms ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in December 2014 would be worth $7,856.22, or a gain of 685.62%, as of December 3, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 192.62% and gold's return of 108.82% over the same time frame.\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for META.\nMeta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. Meta\u2019s growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.73%, and there have been 19 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

          "whole_article": "By Sheila Dang\n(Reuters) -Despite widespread concern that generative AI could interfere with major elections around the globe this year, the technology had limited impact across Meta Platforms' apps, the tech company said on Tuesday.\nCoordinated networks of accounts seeking to spread propaganda or false content largely failed to build a significant audience on Facebook and Instagram or use AI effectively, Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, told a press briefing. The volume of AI-generated misinformation was low and Meta was able to quickly label or remove the content, he said.\nThe snapshot from Meta comes as misinformation experts say AI content has so far failed to significantly sway public opinion, as notable deepfake videos and audio, including of President Joe Biden's voice, have been quickly debunked.\nCoordinated networks of accounts attempting to spread false content are increasingly shifting their activities to other social media and messaging apps with fewer safety guardrails, or are operating their own websites in order to stay online, Clegg said, adding that Meta took down about 20 covert influence operations on its platform this year.\nClegg said Meta was overly stringent in its content moderation decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in content that was mistakenly removed.\nThe company heard feedback from users who complained that their content had been removed unfairly, and Meta will aim to protect free expression and be more precise in enforcing its rules, Clegg said.\n\"We feel we probably overdid it a bit,\" he said. \"While we've been really focusing on reducing prevalence of bad content, I think we also want to redouble our efforts to improve the precision and accuracy with which we act on our rules.\"\nSome Republican lawmakers have questioned what they say is censorship of certain viewpoints on social media. In an August letter to the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he regretted some content take-downs the company made in response to pressure from the Biden administration.\nClegg said Zuckerberg hoped to help shape President-elect Donald Trump's administration on tech policy, including AI.\n\"Mark is very keen to play an active role in the debates that any administration needs to have about maintaining America's leadership in the technological sphere ... and particularly the pivotal role that AI will play in that scenario,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Mark Potter)"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days.\nThe debate around AI systems hitting a \u201cdata wall\u201d or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry.\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said:\n\u201cAll it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it\u2019s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI\u2019s Alexander Wang to Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei to Databricks\u2019 Ali Ghodsi weighing in.\u201d\nJensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said:\n\u201cA foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it\u2019s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we\u2019re learning, however, is that it\u2019s not enough that we\u2019ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.\u201d\nRead\u00a0Huang\u2019s comments in detail here.\nBosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said:\n\u201c\u2026..also acknowledge that this alone isn\u2019t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAnalyst Lauds Meta Platforms (META)\u2019s \u2018Big First Step\u2019 To Monetize AI Models\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\nMeta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 235\nJefferies recently said in a note that Meta\u00a0Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s\u00a0hiring of Clara Shih, former CEO of AI at Salesforce (CRM), is a bullish move, and the company\u2019s creation of a new AI unit focused on business tools is a significant step toward monetizing AI.\n\u201cWe think Clara\u2019s experience at CRM building Agentforce will be advantageous in META\u2019s efforts to build Gen AI tools & agents for the >200M businesses that leverage WhatsApp, IG & FB each month,\u201d the research firm stated.\nThey also pointed out that Shih is already familiar with Meta\u00a0Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s\u00a0and social ecosystem.\n\u201cTo date, META has relied on other software companies like AMZN, MSFT to sell its software (e.g. llama) into the enterprise. We believe this hiring & new business group could be a big first step in META\u2019s plans to directly sell into the enterprise & monetize Llamas Open Source traction,\u201d Jefferies added.\nMeta\u00a0Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) was reiterated as a \u201cbuy\u201d with a $675 price target.\nDespite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\nAccording to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta\u2019s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks 2nd on our list of top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:QRVO) stands against other Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks.\nAs 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. They beckon 2025 with a rather historic run on the stock market that has seen several high-growth technology stocks flourish despite the fact that until September, interest rates in the US were at a two-decade high level.\nDriving the bullishness behind technology stocks is artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that relies on high-end GPUs to run advanced mathematical techniques and infer new conclusions from existing data sets has been the focus of Wall Street and big technology companies. So far, most of the AI-related stock gains have been limited to the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite graphics processing unit (GPU) company whose stock is up by more than\u00a0700%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nHowever, the gains have to broaden out to other stocks for the AI wave to continue. This broadening is dependent on the use of AI increasing among businesses and consumers. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo has some insights to share. In its report titled \u2018Generative AI \u2014 Potential pitfalls, challenges, and risks the bank outlines that while AI \u201chas the potential to be broadly transformative,\u201d there are several \u201coutstanding questions and concerns that need to be addressed before it is widely accepted on a larger scale.\u201d Quoting its \u2018The AI Index 2024 Annual Report,\u2019 the bank points out that from 2012 to 2023, the number of AI incidents has jumped more than tenfold from sitting at roughly 10 to ~122. These incidents cover the ethical misuse of AI such as the wrong detection of criminals stemming from facial recognition systems.\nWF\u00a0points\u00a0out that while these incidents are concerning, other factors will also determine AI\u2019s wider acceptability and use. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints. The bank adds that these factors are also accompanied by the potentially transformative effect of AI on the labor market. Starting from its beliefs about the labor market, WF believes that generative AI, which is different from other AI systems such as machine learning, will have a more \u201cnuanced\u201d impact on the labor market compared to traditional AI. Commenting on common worries of AI taking jobs away, the bank outlines that the jobs that AI will replace will in turn be replaced by new jobs created by AI. To quote WF, it believes \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s disruptive effect on the labor market to mirror other forms of automation \u2014 as in the past, its impact likely will be mitigated over time by new occupations spawned by the innovations themselves.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTo help bolster its claim, WF shares data from MIT. It points out that MIT\u2019s estimates show that \u201c60% of U.S. workers are now employed in occupations that did not exist 84 years ago.\u201d As for which job functions might give way to AI, these include knowledge-based roles such as those found in financial services and support roles such as those performed by customer support agents.\nTwo additional key disruptive AI effects that Wall Street in particular is keenly aware of are its rising costs and the effect on the utility industry. The S&P\u2019s utility sector is up by 28.36% year-to-date which leads the broader index\u2019s 26.48% in gains by nearly two percentage points. Commenting on this, the bank believes that \u201cthere will be a significant increase in hardware demand, notably within the data-center environment, to accommodate the substantial increase in AI workloads,\u201d adding that \u201cit may take a number of years to increase the operational efficiency of various large language models and decrease costs to a level more in-line with existing search engines.\u201d WF also shares that while existing opportunities to expand data center footprint to accommodate AI are present, as they \u201cdiminish, companies may revisit existing data-center locations to retrofit and upgrade hardware and infrastructure in support of the power and data-consumption needs of new AI technologies.\u201d\nGiven the criticality of the data center space to AI, WF expands on this sector in another\u00a0report. Titled \u2018Generative AI transforming data center landscape\u201d it comments on the capital expenditure required to set up data centers, future trends for data centers, and the stock market sectors that might benefit from growing interest and focus on the data center industry. According to its analysis, investor attention is mostly focused on AI-related investments in semiconductors and cloud computing.\nHowever, other sectors, such as \u201ccabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators\u201d are also important. WF quotes a utility company to explain why these tertiary sectors are critical in the AI wave. It shares that utility company believes that \u201cthe server rack power density required to train a generative-AI-based large language model can require up to five to seven times more power than server racks used for traditional IT workloads in a data center.\u201d\nWhile semiconductor companies are natural beneficiaries of the AI boom, some oft-ignored sectors that WF mentions are industrials and materials. It outlines that when it comes to building massive data centers, estimates suggest \u201cthat approximately 35% \u2013 45% of the cost is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out. These areas are addressable by companies who supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors).\u201d Additionally, \u201c40% \u2013 45% and 15% \u2013 20% of the remaining cost can be attributed to electrical and HVAC systems respectively,\u201d according to Wells Fargo. AI is having an effect on materials, as per the bank, in the form of \u201cincreased demand for materials that are used in the production of semiconductor chips, water handling and recycling within data centers, and steel and construction materials to build data centers.\u201d\nFor some materials stocks and a primer on how they are reliant on the broader economic activity, you can check out\u00a010 Best Materials Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s top AI & non-AI stocks that can outpace the flagship S&P, we selected technology-focused stocks from the bank\u2019s recent Focus List and ranked them by their consensus next twelve-month EPS estimates.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(META) the Top Wells Fargo\u2019s Tech Stock to Beat the S&P?\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235\nNTM EPS Estimate: $24.35\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the world\u2019s largest social media company. The firm operates Facebook, which allows it to have a whopping 3.2 billion users in its network. Additionally, its Instagram image-sharing service and WhatsApp communications platforms are among the most widely used in the world. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s indisputable moat in the social networking industry has also allowed it to generate considerable financial resources and use them to establish a foothold in the artificial intelligence industry. It is one of the handful of players in the AI industry with access to an in-house foundational AI model. Called Llama, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) competes through it with other AI giants like Google and Microsoft. As it has also invested billions into AI like its peers, the firm\u2019s hypothesis is dependent on its ability to monetize its AI services offered to advertisers and users on its platforms. The AI services include AI campaign management and other platforms.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMeta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks. META is a top cyclical stock Wells Fargo is confident about. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

It is not an exaggeration to say that 2024 has been rough for markets given that crucial events like the commencement of an easing cycle followed by the US elections remained a major influence on the overall environment. Amid all these awaited events, the tech sector has not been an investor favorite, however, that may change sooner than we think.\nOn November 26, Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, joined\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his opinion on the stock market, particularly the tech sector. Krishna raised his S&P 500 price target for 2025 to 6,600 and shed light on why he believes such is possible.\nHe shared that the economy is pretty constructive from a macro perspective given that the virtuous cycle between income and employment remains solid. He added that consumer balances are going up and believes that the overall economic conditions of the country have been positive. All these reasons combined explain the price target of 6,600 for the S&P 500.\nSpeaking of the technology sector, Krishna agreed that the \u201cmarket is, on a consistent basis, underestimating the earnings power of tech, especially big tech.\u201d He added that at the same time, the market is also overestimating the earnings power of the other non-tech names in the S&P 500. He shared that the market expected Big Tech to post earnings up by 19% year-over-year and have \u201cflat revisions\u201d in the third quarter. Non-tech stocks on the other hand were marked down by 2%.\nHowever, Krishna revealed that as the earnings period of Q3 2024 comes to a close, Big Tech actually delivered 31% of earnings growth during the quarter. He added that non-tech stocks have moved in the same direction but only incrementally. He explained that, for example, non-tech stocks were originally marked down, but instead, they expanded by 2%, accelerating at a very slow pace.\nHe also emphasized that the rate at which the market expects Big Tech earnings to slow down is in reality much lower than the actual deceleration rate. Overall, Krishna expects the market to converge but highlighted that it may not be as close as we expect it to be, probably not sooner than Q1 2026.\nStory Continues\nWhile turmoil and uncertainty remain a key element in the market, some stocks are revolutionary enough that they are bound to offer great opportunities in the coming years, if not now. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best stocks to buy for long term growth.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the best stocks to buy for long term growth we sifted through multiple rankings on the internet. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and ranked them in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in December.\nJared Cohen, Goldman Sachs president of global affairs, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that amid rising data center-driven energy demand because of AI, the US would need to collaborate with other countries via \u201cdiplomacy.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at data centers for cloud workloads versus data centers for AI workloads, data centers for AI workloads require ultra-high density. They need a concentrated power source, and so intermittent power like wind and solar doesn\u2019t fit the bill. You need base load power, so I think nuclear, coal, and natural gas are necessary, and we have plenty of that in the US. The problem is we can\u2019t transport it from where it is through multiple jurisdictions because of the \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 issue. So, the US is going to need some kind of overflow option if it wants to continue leading in this space. There\u2019s not a single geography that I would say represents a panacea to this problem.\u201d\nAnswering a question about whether the return to relatively cheaper and reliable energy sources like coal could satisfy the AI-driven energy demand, the analyst said the US would still need to look beyond just relying on its own sources because the need for power is huge.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to probably bring another 35-plus gigawatts of power online relative to the 17 gigawatts of power that are already online feeding these data centers in just the next couple of years. That\u2019s not enough, that\u2019s not enough time.

They are building better models to analyze all of their data more effectively. As they analyze more data, time spent per user is growing off already large numbers. You already have 30 to 40 minutes per user per day across Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms, and that time is growing. On top of that, the way they monetize this time through more relevant ads\u2014ads with higher click-through rates that actually drive more transactions\u2014is also improving. So, when we think about this early generative AI cycle, Meta continues to be the company farthest along in building new models to better analyze its leading first-party data, drive more engagement, and monetize that engagement more effectively.\u201d\nDespite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\nAccording to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta\u2019s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.\u201d\nOverall, MU\u00a0ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in December. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The latest country to embrace it is Japan. According to\u00a0The Japan Times,\u00a0private-sector businesses in the country have begun embracing related information technologies to enhance operational efficiency. GenAI search services, in particular, are proving\u00a0useful for searching corporate databases.\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI News Updates This Weekend\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nThe news states how Lion, a leading Japanese consumer goods company, has built a generative AI-powered search system that allows its researchers to search through research reports and conference materials stored in the company\u2019s database efficiently.\n\u201cTo drive innovation, we need a system that allows researchers to have quick access to technical knowledge when they need it\u201d.\nYamaoka revealed that the time required to locate a desired document has been reduced to an average of one-fifth of that with conventional search systems. The company further states that GenAI is proving beneficial not only for recruits and young employees but also for those transitioning to new workplaces, allowing them to \u201csystematically acquire knowledge in unfamiliar fields\u201d. Even though GenAI comes with its fair share of challenges such as hallucinations and copyright concerns, it also stands to benefit the corporate world in the long run.\nIn other news, one popular AI chatbot is seemingly facing a technical glitch and preventing it from saying one name in particular: David Mayer. If there is one name in the AI realm that everyone knows about, it\u2019s ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence chatbot has been trained on large amounts of data to create content, including voices, music, pictures, and videos. However, it was recently unearthed by a Reddit user that the AI chatbot is unable to say David Mayer.\nAccording to AI expert Justine Moore, a plausible scenario is that someone named David Mayer went out of his way to remove his presence from the internet. For example, strict privacy laws in the European Union allow citizens to file \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $256.\nThe analyst cited the multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flows as factors for rating reiteration.\nThe analyst writes that, as per SensorTower data, App Store revenues in first-quarter FY25 (after 64 days) rose to $5.6 billion, a 15.2% year-over-year increase. Total downloads (iPhone and iPad) grew by 7.4% year-over-year, reaching 6.1 billion.\nIn November, global App Store revenue increased by 15.8% year-over-year, with China showing a 9.0% year-over-year growth, adds the analyst.\nMohan writes that App store dollars per download also rose by 7.3% year-over-year.\nEntertainment app revenue grew 35% year-over-year after 64 days and Gaming revenue increased 5% to $2.7 billion. Games remain the largest segment, followed by Entertainment (16%) and other categories, adds the analyst.\nMohan says this highlights a shift toward more diverse revenue streams as non-gaming apps monetize more. The impact of the new Apple Intelligence on download and revenue trends will be closely monitored.\nThe analyst projects total services revenue growth of 13% year-over-year for both first-quarter and second-quarter of FY25 and sees the resilience in services as a long-term positive indicator.\nMohan writes that 270 days after Apple\u2019s compliance deadline, there has been minimal impact on web browser downloads in the EU.\nThe iPhone company reported\u00a0fiscal\u00a0fourth-quarter\u00a0revenue\u00a0of\u00a0$94.9 billion, topping analyst estimates of\u00a0$94.56 billion.

You invest here and create jobs.\u201d\nIf confirmed, that would be a tenfold increase from Apple\u2019s last offer of $100 million. Its initial bid was an even smaller $10 million for a factory making accessories and components in the city of Bandung just outside of the capital Jakarta, Bloomberg News earlier reported. Representatives for Apple didn\u2019t immediately reply to emails seeking comment outside of regular office hours.\nIndonesia prohibited the sale of Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone 16 devices, saying it has failed to comply with domestic content requirements for smartphones and tablets. The Cupertino, California-based company had pledged in 2023 to invest 1.7 trillion rupiah ($107 million) for developer academies across Indonesia yet had fallen short by some $10 million.\nRoeslani doubled-down on an earlier government demand that Apple should offer Indonesia a better deal than Vietnam, where it\u2019s funneled about $15 billion for manufacturing facilities. \u201cTheir investment must be bigger,\u201d he said.\nIndustry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, whose office had imposed the iPhone 16 ban, said last month that his top priority was to get Apple to open a local plant, similar to other phone makers like Samsung Electronics Co. and Xiaomi Corp.\nIf Apple manufactures its devices locally, it would create a ripple effect of investments across related sectors and create more jobs, Roeslani said. \u201cThe most important thing is that the global value chain will move to us,\u201d he said.\nIndonesia has a long track record of playing hardball with companies to seek more investment and protect its domestic industry. The government has forced ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok to split its shopping feature from its social media platform a bid to shield its retail sector from cheap Chinese-made goods. It\u2019s also banned the export of raw materials like nickel to push companies to process minerals onshore and develop local battery plants.\nStory Continues\nThe intensified push for investment comes as newly inaugurated President Prabowo Subianto aims to reach 8% economic growth in his five-year term. Gross domestic product expanded at just 4.95% last quarter, its slowest pace in a year, amid weakening factory activity and consumption.\nIndonesia is a potential growth market for Apple with a young, increasingly tech-savvy population. The $1-trillion economy has over 350 million active mobile phones, outnumbering the nation\u2019s 270 million population, according to government data.\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n(Updates to say Apple didn\u2019t immediately reply to requests for comment in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Nvidia (NVDA) surging to double the value of Apple (AAPL) or the collapse of OPEC aren't exactly events that most investors are betting on. But markets have a way of being unpredictable and traders know surprises are bound to happen in 2025.\nSo that you don\u2019t get caught off-guard Saxo has revealed its annual Outrageous Predictions (OPs) list, a series of events that, while highly unlikely, could just happen.\nThese predictions, which are intentionally far-fetched yet intriguing, are designed to challenge conventional thinking and spark debate among financial experts. While they are not intended to be Saxo\u2019s official forecasts, they highlight potential events that could shake the global financial system to its core.\nRead more: Global chip stocks to consider as investments beyond Nvidia\n\u201cThe Saxo Outrageous Predictions are not exactly news and not exactly real \u2014 at least not yet. While we don\u2019t know which stories will drive the global economy in the coming year, our 2025 predictions, from Nvidia trouncing its Magnificent 7 peers to the fall of OPEC, from a bold bet on reflation in China to a great leap forward in biotech, are just as promised: outrageous,\u201d said John Hardy, chief macro strategist at Saxo Bank.\nHere\u2019s a look at Saxo\u2019s 2025 Outrageous Predictions:\n1. Nvidia\u2019s value soars to twice that of Apple\nNvidia will become the most profitable company of all time by 2025, fuelled by the launch of its revolutionary Blackwell chip, a 208 billion transistor innovation that will outperform its predecessors by 25 times in energy efficiency.\nAs demand for AI capabilities surges, Nvidia will dominate the sector.\nPotential market impact: Nvidia shares could surpass $250, though concerns about its growing market share and regulatory scrutiny could dampen its prospects.\n\u2022 USD\n(NVDA)\nFollow\nView quote details\n2. Pound erases post-Brexit discounts versus the Euro\nBy 2025, the pound (GBPEUR=X) will rise above 1.27 against the euro \u2014 erasing its entire post-Brexit discount.\n\u201cThe UK outlook is as constructive as ever in the post-Brexit era. That is, it is the most positive relative to the sick man of Europe, which is, well\u2026Europe, or at least the core Eurozone countries, France and Germany,\u201d Saxo\u2019s team wrote.\nThe UK\u2019s fiscal policies are seen as more growth-friendly, with a new Labour government prioritising growth while curbing inefficient public sector spending.\nPotential market impact: The pound\u2019s appreciation would provide a boost to domestic investment and growth, seeing the euro/sterling rate fall as low as 0.7500, a level not seen since before the Brexit referendum. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 (^FTSE) would also see strong performance.\nStory continues\n\u2022 USD\n(GBPEUR=X)\nFollow\nView quote details\n3. Electrification boom ends OPEC\nThe electrification of transportation will doom OPEC\u2019s influence by 2025.\nAs oil (BZ=F) demand declines due to a shift toward electric vehicles (EVs), the oil cartel\u2019s relevance will diminish. With some OPEC members already flouting production quotas, Saxo sees a break-up within the group, leading to a sharp fall in oil prices.\nPotential market impact: Crude oil prices could plummet, benefiting industries like airlines, chemicals, and logistics. However, the decline in oil prices could be short-lived as higher-cost producers, particularly in North America, scale back production.\n\u2022 USD\n(BZ=F)\nFollow\nView quote details\n4. China unleashes $7tn stimulus\nIn an effort to reinvigorate its economy, China unleashes a massive CNY 50 trillion (\u00a35.5tn/$7tn) stimulus package.\nThis spending will be focused on the digital yuan (e-CNY), placing direct cash into consumers' hands, while encouraging social policies to improve quality of life.\nPotential market impact: A strong reflationary impact in China and the world, outperformance of EM relative to DM and China in particular, higher commodity prices globally, a stronger Chinese renminbi.\n5. First bio-printed human heart ushers in new era of longevity\nIn a landmark scientific breakthrough, next year sees the successful creation of a fully functional human heart through 3D bioprinting.\nThe heart will be made from stem cells and biodegradable scaffold materials, offering a promising future for bio-printed organs.\nRead more: Stocks to watch: Salesforce, Lululemon, Frasers Group, Berkeley and Foot Locker\nPotential market impact: Biotechnology and 3D printing sectors will see a surge in investment, with many companies in the space likely to go public. This innovation could reshape healthcare, leading to improved patient outcomes and substantial economic growth.\n6. US imposes AI data centre tax as power prices run wild\nThe US faces an energy crisis as the growing demand for AI data centres drives power prices to unprecedented levels. This leads to popular outrage, prompting local governments to impose heavy taxes and fines on tech giants to offset the soaring electricity costs, especially for households.\nPotential market impact: The US will likely see a surge in power infrastructure investments, with companies like Fluor (FLR) and Tesla (TSLA) benefiting. Long-term natural gas prices could double, contributing to a more inflationary economic environment.\n7. Trump 2.0 blows up the US dollar\nA second Trump administration dramatically alters US trade and economic policies. This would include imposing massive tariffs on imports and introducing an Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nWhile such policies could trigger a spike in the US dollar, they could also lead to a scramble for alternative currencies.\n\u2022 USD\n(BTC-USD)\nFollow\nView quote details\nPotential market impact: The crypto market, including bitcoin (BTC-USD), could quadruple, surpassing $10tn. The US dollar might fall 20% against major currencies and 30% versus gold, while the economy continues to reflate.\n8. A natural disaster bankrupts a large insurance company for the first time\nA catastrophic storm in the US could trigger insurance claims far exceeding the $40bn seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. One of the largest US insurers, unprepared for climate change risks, could go bankrupt, causing panic in the industry.\nPotential market impact: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) shares rise as Buffett\u2019s company has enough capital to weather the panic and the company gains market share.\nNow, most might be thinking there outrageous predictions will never happen.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks.\nKen Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors.\nFisher said, \"I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused.\"\nBesides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors.\nIn the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips.\nREAD ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams\u2019 Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks.\nEven though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better.\n\"Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly,\" Ken Fisher said.\nKen Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the \"magnificent seven\" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions.\nStory Continues\n\"If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward\", Fisher said in a video interview.\nOur Methodology\nWe looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm's stake at the end of Q3 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nHere is Why Warren Buffett Sold AAPL Stock\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nFisher Asset Management\u2019s Equity Stake: $13.66 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes: 158\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a tech giant best known for its iPhone, Mac computers, and iPads, among other hardware products. Hardware sales account for the biggest share of the company's revenues at 75%. Nevertheless, the company also generates significant revenues from selling services. Its service segment includes the Apple Pay, App Store, Apple Music and iCloud units. It also offers advertising services.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of Ken Fisher's top stock picks for 2025, with a 27.84% gain this year. Investors are optimistic about Apple's future due to its strong financial performance, innovative products, and high demand for iPhones. On October 31, Apple reported a record fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% from last year, driven by the iPhone 16 series, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. CEO Tim Cook also highlighted new Apple Intelligence features. On October 30, Apple introduced the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, which improve Mac performance and efficiency.\nSimilarly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is staring at new revenue opportunities with the integration of artificial intelligence under Apple Intelligence. The company is integrating AI into its iPhones and services as one of the ways of fuelling demand to enhance the upgrade cycle. According to Citi's Consumer Electronics Holiday Survey, smartphone spending and purchase intentions are rising, with iPhone preference rising to 48% from 46% the previous year.\nIn their third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "AWS expands its widely adopted machine learning service, combining comprehensive data, analytics, and AI capabilities\nLAS VEGAS, December 03, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--At AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the next generation of Amazon SageMaker, unifying the capabilities customers need for fast SQL analytics, petabyte-scale big data processing, data exploration and integration, model development and training, and generative artificial intelligence (AI) into one integrated platform.\nThe new SageMaker Unified Studio makes it easy for customers to find and access data from across their organization and brings together purpose-built AWS analytics, machine learning (ML), and AI capabilities so customers can act on their data using the best tool for the job across all types of common data use cases, assisted by Amazon Q Developer along the way.\nSageMaker Catalog and built-in governance capabilities allow the right users to access the right data, models, and development artifacts for the right purpose.\nThe new SageMaker Lakehouse unifies data across data lakes, data warehouses, operational databases, and enterprise applications, making it easy to access and work with data from within SageMaker Unified Studio and using familiar AI and ML tools or query engines compatible with Apache Iceberg.\nNew zero-ETL integrations with leading Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications make it easy to access data from third-party SaaS applications in SageMaker Lakehouse and Amazon Redshift for analytics or ML without complex data pipelines.\nCustomers and partners including Adastra, Confluent, Etleap, idealista, Informatica, Lennar, Natera, NatWest Group, NTT Data, Roche, Tableau, Toyota Motor North America, and more are already exploring the next generation of SageMaker to bring together their data, analytics, and AI initiatives.\n\"We are seeing a convergence of analytics and AI, with customers using data in increasingly interconnected ways\u2014from historical analytics to ML model training and generative AI applications,\" said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Data and AI at AWS. \"To support these workloads, many customers already use combinations of our purpose-built analytics and ML tools, such as Amazon SageMaker\u2014the de facto standard for working with data and building ML models\u2014Amazon EMR, Amazon Redshift, Amazon S3 data lakes, and AWS Glue. The next generation of SageMaker brings together these capabilities\u2014along with some exciting new features\u2014to give customers all the tools they need for data processing, SQL analytics, ML model development and training, and generative AI, directly within SageMaker.\"\nStory Continues\nCollaborate and build faster with Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio\nToday, hundreds of thousands of customers use SageMaker to build, train, and deploy ML models. Many customers also rely on the comprehensive set of purpose-built analytics services from AWS to support a wide range of workloads, including SQL analytics, search analytics, big data processing, and streaming analytics. Increasingly, customers are not using these tools in isolation; rather, they are using a combination of analytics, ML, and generative AI to derive insights and power new experiences for their users. These customers would benefit from a unified environment that brings together familiar AWS tools for analytics, ML, and generative AI, along with easy access to all of their data and the ability to easily collaborate on data projects with other members of their team or organization.\nThe next generation of SageMaker includes a new, unified studio that gives customers a single data and AI development environment where users can find and access all of the data in their organization, act on it using the best tool for the job across all types of common data use cases, and collaborate within teams and across roles to scale their data and AI initiatives. SageMaker Unified Studio brings together functionality and tools from the range of standalone \"studios,\" query editors, and visual tools that customers enjoy today in Amazon Bedrock, Amazon EMR, Amazon Redshift, AWS Glue, and the existing SageMaker Studio. This makes it easy for customers to access and use these capabilities to discover and prepare data, author queries or code, process data, and build ML models. Amazon Q Developer assists along the way to support development tasks such as data discovery, coding, SQL generation, and data integration. For example, a user could ask Amazon Q, \"What data should I use to get a better idea of product sales?\" or \"Generate a SQL to calculate total revenue by product category.\" Users can securely publish and share data, models, applications, and other artifacts with members of their team or organization, accelerating discoverability and usage of the data assets. With the Amazon Bedrock integrated development environment (IDE) in SageMaker Unified Studio, users can build and deploy generative AI applications quickly and easily using Amazon Bedrock\u2019s selection of high-performing foundation models and tools such as Agents, Guardrails, Knowledge Bases, and Flows. SageMaker Unified Studio comes with data discovery, sharing, and governance capabilities built in, so analysts, data scientists, and engineers can easily search and find the right data they need for their use case, while applying desired security controls and permissions, maintaining access control, and securing their data.\nNatWest Group, a leading bank in the United Kingdom serving more than 19 million customers, uses multiple tools for data engineering, SQL analytics, ML, and generative AI workloads. With SageMaker Unified Studio, NatWest Group will have a single unified environment across the organization to support these workloads and anticipates a 50% reduction in the time required for their data users to access analytics and AI capabilities, enabling them to spend less time managing multiple services and more time innovating for their customers.\nMeet enterprise security needs with Amazon SageMaker data and AI governance\nThe next generation of SageMaker simplifies the discovery, governance, and collaboration of data and AI across an organization. With SageMaker Catalog, built on Amazon DataZone, administrators can define and implement consistent access policies using a single permission model with granular controls, while data workers from across teams can securely discover and access approved data and models enriched with business context metadata created by generative AI. Administrators can easily define and enforce permissions across models, tools, and data sources, while customized safeguards help make AI applications secure and compliant. Customers can also safeguard their AI models with data classification, toxicity detection, guardrails, and responsible AI policies within SageMaker.\nReduce data silos and unify data with Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse\nToday, more than one million data lakes are built on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), allowing customers to centralize their data assets and derive value with AWS analytics, AI, and ML tools. Data lakes make it possible for customers to store their data as-is\u2014making it easy to combine data from multiple sources. Customers may have data spread across multiple data lakes, as well as a data warehouse, and would benefit from a simple way to unify all of this data.\nSageMaker Lakehouse provides unified access to data stored in Amazon S3 data lakes, Redshift data warehouses, and federated data sources, reducing data silos and making it easy to query data, no matter how and where it is physically stored. With this new Apache Iceberg-compatible lakehouse capability in SageMaker, customers can access and work with all of their data from within SageMaker Unified Studio, as well as with familiar AI and ML tools and query engines compatible with Apache Iceberg open standards. Now, customers can use their preferred analytics and ML tools on their data, no matter how and where it is physically stored, to support use cases including SQL analytics, ad-hoc querying, data science, ML, and generative AI. SageMaker Lakehouse provides integrated, fine-grained access controls that are consistently applied across the data in all analytics and AI tools in the lakehouse, enabling customers to define permissions once and securely share data across their organization.\nRoche, a global pioneer in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics focused on advancing science to improve people's lives, will use SageMaker Lakehouse to unify data from Redshift and Amazon S3 data lakes, eliminating data silos, enhancing interoperability among teams, and allowing users to seamlessly leverage data without the need for costly data movement or duplicated security access controls. With SageMaker Lakehouse, Roche anticipates a 40% reduction in data processing time, allowing them to focus more on driving their business forward and less on data management.\nQuickly and easily access SaaS data with the new zero-ETL integrations with SaaS applications\nTo truly leverage data across their operations, businesses need seamless access to all their data, regardless of its location. That is why AWS has invested in a zero-ETL future, where data integration is no longer a tedious, manual effort, and customers can easily get their data where they need it. This includes zero-ETL integrations for Amazon Aurora MySQL and PostgreSQL, Amazon RDS for MySQL, and Amazon DynamoDB with Amazon Redshift, which help customers quickly and easily access data from popular relational and non-relational databases in Redshift and SageMaker Lakehouse for analytics and ML. In addition to operational databases and data lakes, many customers also have critical enterprise data stored in SaaS applications and would benefit from easy access to this data for analytics and ML.\nThe new zero-ETL integrations with SaaS applications make it easy for customers to access their data from applications such as Zendesk and SAP in SageMaker Lakehouse and Redshift for analytics and AI. This removes the need for data pipelines, which can be challenging and costly to build, complex to manage, and prone to errors that may delay access to time-sensitive insights. Zero-ETL integrations for SaaS applications incorporate best practices for full data sync, detection of incremental updates and deletes, and target merge operations.\nOrganizations of all sizes and across industries, including Infosys, Intuit, and Woolworths, are already benefiting from AWS zero-ETL integrations to quickly and easily connect and analyze data without building and managing data pipelines. With the zero-ETL integrations for SaaS applications, for example, online real estate platform idealista will be able to simplify their data extraction and ingestion processes, eliminating the need for multiple pipelines to access data stored in third-party SaaS applications and freeing their data engineering team to focus on deriving actionable insights from data rather than building and managing infrastructure.\nThe next generation of SageMaker is available today. SageMaker Unified Studio is currently in preview and will be made generally available soon.\nTo learn more, visit:\nThe AWS Blog for details on today\u2019s announcement.\nThe Amazon SageMaker page to learn more about the service.\nThe SageMaker Unified Studio page, SageMaker data and AI governance page, and SageMaker Lakehouse page to learn how companies are using these capabilities.\nThe AWS re:Invent page for more details on everything happening at AWS re:Invent.\nAbout Amazon Web Services\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 240 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 108 Availability Zones within 34 geographic regions, with announced plans for 18 more Availability Zones and six more AWS Regions in Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

          "whole_article": "Amazon Q Developer is the first generative AI-powered assistant for large-scale migration and modernization of Windows .NET, VMware, and mainframe workloads, accelerating transformation timelines and reducing costs\nLAS VEGAS, December 03, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--At AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced new capabilities for Amazon Q Developer, the most capable generative AI assistant for software development, that take the undifferentiated heavy-lifting out of complex and time-consuming application migration and modernization projects, saving customers and partners time and money.\nModernize Windows .NET applications to Linux up to four times faster and reduce licensing costs by up to 40%.\nTransform VMware workloads to cloud-native architectures, converting on-premises network configurations into AWS equivalents in hours instead of weeks.\nAccelerate mainframe modernization by streamlining labor-intensive work like code analysis, documentation, planning, and refactoring applications.\nADP, Amdocs, Caylent, Cognizant, Compass UOL, HCLTech, Heirloom, Infosys, Mission Cloud, Signaturit Group, Slalom, SoftServe, Steamhaus, Tata Consultancy Services, and Toyota Motor North America are among customers and partners using Amazon Q Developer to migrate and modernize their legacy workloads faster.\n\"We are combining Amazon Q Developer with our nearly two decades of experience helping organizations migrate and modernize their legacy workloads on AWS to accelerate and simplify large-scale transformations,\" said Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, vice president of Technology, at AWS. \"This is a game-changer for customers and partners looking to move off of Windows .NET, VMware, and mainframes. Now, Amazon Q significantly speeds up application transformation projects with agents that can autonomously complete some of the most labor-intensive tasks, such as analyzing, planning, code generation, and testing, saving customers time and money, and helping them realize the full value of the cloud.\"\nMany organizations have a large number of legacy applications that often require specialized expertise to operate and are expensive and time-consuming to maintain. While they want to move away from these legacy technologies, modernizing them can take months or years of tedious work. As a result, organizations stall or postpone these projects entirely, so they can prioritize building new applications and experiences. To make these kinds of projects easier, Amazon Q Developer provides transformation capabilities that use AI-powered agents to automate the heavy lifting involved in upgrading and modernizing, such as autonomously analyzing source code, generating new code, testing it, and executing the change once approved by the customer. Earlier this year, Amazon integrated the Java transformation capability of Amazon Q Developer into its internal systems to migrate tens of thousands of production applications from older versions of Java to Java 17. This effort saved more than 4,500 years of development work, compared to what it would have taken previously, and realized performance improvements of $260 million in annual cost savings. Now, AWS is extending this technology to support more large-scale legacy transformation projects.\nStory Continues\nModernize Windows .NET applications up to four times faster: Organizations today want to accelerate their modernization from Windows .NET Framework to cross-platform Windows .NET on Linux for reduced licensing costs, enhanced security, optimized performance, and to simplify the adoption of modern development practices. With Amazon Q, customers and partners can modernize .NET applications from Windows to Linux to realize up to a 40% reduction in licensing costs. To start a transformation, a developer simply selects \"Transform\" under the AWS Toolkit section in their integrated development environment (IDE) and confirms the specific file they want to modernize. Amazon Q then uses agents to automatically identify the components that need to be upgraded, create a transformation plan, fix any build errors, and execute the plan. This includes upgrading existing code and configuration files, generating any new files it needs, and fixing any issues identified with failed builds before presenting a summary to the developer.\n\nSignaturit Group, a European provider of highly secure, complete digital transactions, is already using Amazon Q to accelerate their modernization projects. While Signaturit knew they wanted to move their Windows .NET applications to improve their speed, efficiency, and costs, it was projected to take them up to eight months to complete the project, and competing priorities kept taking precedent. By using the new capabilities of Amazon Q, Signaturit Group was able to modernize their legacy code and accelerate the migration of their license management application from Windows .NET to Linux in just a few days, without having to deprioritize or delay other projects to make it happen.\n\nTransform VMware workloads: As customers and partners exit data centers, one of the key workloads they want to modernize quickly is VMware. Amazon Q now simplifies and speeds up the transformation of VMware workloads to AWS, helping them benefit from improved security and resilience even faster. Customers and partners no longer have to spend as much time evaluating which workloads can be safely moved or if they have designed the right infrastructure to meet their security and scaling needs. Amazon Q uses agents to automatically identify dependencies and create a plan to modernize workloads in waves, accomplishing in minutes what could take weeks. Amazon Q agents also convert on-premises networking configurations to AWS networking equivalents in hours instead of weeks, compared to traditional manual approaches.\n\nCognizant, a multinational information technology services and consulting company that helps organizations modernize technology, reimagine processes, and transform experiences, is using Amazon Q to help its customers accelerate the VMware modernization process. By leveraging Amazon Q, Cognizant will be able to accelerate the modernization of hundreds of VMware workloads for clients faster, allowing them to focus on their work, helping customers reimagine processes, and transform experiences for end users.\n\nAccelerate mainframe modernization: One of the most complex systems preventing organizations from moving out of data centers is mainframes. Amazon Q now streamlines the labor-intensive work, such as code analysis, documentation, planning, and refactoring applications, involved in mainframe modernization projects, starting with IBM z/OS mainframes. Now, partners and customers can collaborate using Amazon Q to reduce costs and accelerate their modernization timelines. Amazon Q agents can assist with a range of modernization tasks, like automatically generating documentation for COBOL code and quickly decomposing monolithic applications into components that are ready to be moved to AWS.\n\nADP, a global provider of human capital management (HCM) solutions, faced challenges such as understanding and documenting complex legacy mainframe systems, which hindered their modernization efforts. Previously, their teams spent considerable time manually tracing program logic and connections to identify critical fields\u2014an unsustainable process for thousands of COBOL programs. Leveraging the transformation capabilities of Amazon Q, they were able to generate comprehensive, AI-driven documentation with deep insights into program interconnections, business rules, and error handling in just minutes as opposed to weeks, allowing them to accelerate their modernization journey.\nTo help customers and partners more efficiently collaborate on large-scale transformation projects, all three of these capabilities are available through a new Amazon Q Developer web application. Designed to specifically help customers perform hundreds of complex transformation projects at the same time, the new web experience gives teams a central place to review plans, refine them based on their organization\u2019s specific needs, and track key project milestones throughout the process. The VMware and mainframe modernization capabilities are only available through this new experience, while developers can also perform Windows .NET transformations within their IDE.\nAll of these new Amazon Q capabilities are available in preview today.\nTo learn more, visit:\nThe AWS News Blog for details on today\u2019s announcements.\nThe Amazon Q Developer transformation page to learn more about the capabilities.\nThe Amazon Q Developer customer page to learn how companies are using Amazon Q.\nThe AWS re:Invent page for more details on everything happening at AWS re:Invent.\nAbout Amazon Web Services\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

          "whole_article": "New state-of-the-art foundation models from Amazon deliver frontier intelligence and industry-leading price performance\nAmazon Nova models expand the growing selection of the broadest and most capable foundation models in Amazon Bedrock for enterprise customers\nLAS VEGAS, December 03, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, at AWS re:Invent, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) introduced Amazon Nova, a new generation of foundation models (FMs) that have state-of-the-art intelligence across a wide range of tasks, and industry-leading price performance. Amazon Nova models will be available in Amazon Bedrock, and include: Amazon Nova Micro (a very fast, text-to-text model); and Amazon Nova Lite, Amazon Nova Pro, and Amazon Nova Premier (multi-modal models that can process text, images, and videos to generate text). Amazon also launched two additional models \u2013 Amazon Nova Canvas (which generates studio-quality images) and Amazon Nova Reel (which generates studio-quality videos).\n\"Inside Amazon, we have about 1,000 generative AI applications in motion, and we\u2019ve had a bird\u2019s-eye view of what application builders are still grappling with,\" said Rohit Prasad, SVP of Amazon Artificial General Intelligence. \"Our new Amazon Nova models are intended to help with these challenges for internal and external builders, and provide compelling intelligence and content generation while also delivering meaningful progress on latency, cost-effectiveness, customization, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and agentic capabilities.\"\nAmazon Nova understanding models demonstrate exceptional intelligence, capabilities, and speed\nAmazon Nova includes four state-of-the-art models. The first, Amazon Nova Micro, is a text-only model that delivers the lowest latency responses at very low cost. The next three are: Amazon Nova Lite, a very low-cost multimodal model that is lightning fast for processing image, video, and text inputs; Amazon Nova Pro, a highly capable multimodal model with the best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost for a wide range of tasks; and Amazon Nova Premier, the most capable of Amazon\u2019s multimodal models for complex reasoning tasks and for use as the best teacher for distilling custom models. Amazon Nova Micro, Amazon Nova Lite, and Amazon Nova Pro are generally available today; Amazon Nova Premier will be available in the Q1 2025 timeframe.\nWe tested the Amazon Nova models against a wide range of industry standard benchmarks. Amazon Nova Micro, Amazon Nova Lite, and Amazon Nova Pro perform quite competitively against the best models in their respective categories.\nStory Continues\nAmazon Nova Micro was found to be equal1 or better than both Meta LLaMa 3.1 8B on all 11 applicable benchmarks, and Google Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B on all 12 applicable benchmarks. With Amazon Nova Micro\u2019s industry-leading speed of 210 output tokens per second, it is ideal for applications that require fast responses.\nAmazon Nova Lite is also highly competitive with other models in the same intelligence class; it performed equal or better on 17 of 19 benchmarks compared to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o mini, equal or better on 17 of 21 benchmarks compared to Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B, and equal or better on 10 of 12 benchmarks compared to Anthropic\u2019s Claude Haiku 3.5. In addition to delivering accuracy on text benchmarks, Amazon Nova Lite stands out on understanding videos, charts, and documents as measured by benchmarks such as VATEX, ChartQA, and DocVQA. Amazon Nova Lite also excels at agentic workflows, such as function calling measured by the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard and on the core capabilities of understanding visual elements for taking actions on browsers and computer screens, as measured by VisualWebBench (web browser action grounding benchmark) and Mind2Web (generalist multimodal agents benchmark).\nAmazon Nova Pro performed equal or better on 17 of 20 benchmarks compared to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, equal or better on 16 of 21 benchmarks compared to Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro, and equal or better on 9 of 20 benchmarks compared to Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5v2. In addition to accuracy on text and visual intelligence benchmarks, Amazon Nova Pro excels at instruction-following and multimodal agentic workflows as measured by the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard, and Mind2Web.\nMulti-lingual and Multimodal Support with Long Context\nAmazon Nova Micro, Lite, and Pro support over 200 languages. Amazon Nova Micro supports context length of 128K input tokens, whereas Amazon Nova Lite and Amazon Nova Pro support context length of 300K tokens, or 30 minutes of video processing. In early 2025, Amazon will support context length of over 2M input tokens.\nFast and cost-effective\nAll Amazon Nova models are fast, cost-effective and have been designed to be easy to use with a customer\u2019s systems and data. Amazon Nova Micro, Amazon Nova Lite, and Amazon Nova Pro are at least 75 percent less expensive than the best performing models in their respective intelligence classes in Amazon Bedrock. They are also the fastest models in their respective intelligence classes in Amazon Bedrock.\nSeamless integration with Amazon Bedrock\nAll Amazon Nova models are integrated with Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that makes high-performing FMs from leading AI companies and Amazon available for use through a single API. Using Amazon Bedrock, customers can easily experiment with and evaluate Amazon Nova models, as well as other FMs, to determine the best model for an application.\nSupport for fine-tuning to boost accuracy\nThe models also support custom fine-tuning, which allows customers to point the models to examples in their own proprietary data that have been labeled to boost accuracy. The Amazon Nova model learns what matters most to the customer from their own data (including text, images, and videos), and then Amazon Bedrock trains a private fine-tuned model that will provide tailored responses.\nDistillation to train smaller, more efficient models\nIn addition to supporting fine-tuning, the models also support distillation, which enables the transfer of specific knowledge from a larger, highly-capable \"teacher model\" to a smaller, more efficient model that is highly accurate, but also faster and cheaper to run.\nRAG to ground responses in data\nAmazon Nova models are integrated with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and excel at Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which enables customers to ensure the best accuracy, by grounding responses in an organization\u2019s own data.\nOptimized for agentic applications\nAmazon Nova models have been optimized to make them easy to use and effective in agentic applications that require interacting with an organization\u2019s proprietary systems and data through multiple APIs to execute multistep tasks.\nAccess to production-grade visual content with Nova creative content generation models\nAmazon Nova Canvas is a state-of-the-art image generation model that creates professional grade images from text or images provided in prompts. Amazon Nova Canvas also provides features that make it easy to edit images using text inputs, and provides controls for adjusting color scheme and layout. The model comes with built-in controls to support safe and responsible AI use. These include features like watermarking, which allows the source of an image to always be traced, and content moderation, which limits the generation of potentially harmful content. Amazon Nova Canvas performs better than image generators such as OpenAI DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion in side-by-side human evaluations conducted by a third party, and on key automated metrics.\nAmazon Nova Reel is a state-of-the-art video generation model that allows customers to easily create high-quality video from text and images. It is ideal for content creation in advertising, marketing, or training. Customers can use natural language prompts to control visual style and pacing, including camera motion, rotation, and zooming. It outperforms comparable models in quality and consistency, according to side-by-side human evaluations conducted by a third party that preferred Amazon Nova Reel-generated videos over those generated by Runway\u2019s Gen-3 Alpha. Like Amazon Nova Canvas, Amazon Nova Reel comes with built-in controls to support safety and responsible AI use, including watermarking and content moderation. Amazon Nova Reel currently generates six-second videos, and will support the generation of videos of up to two-minutes in length in the coming months.\nWhat\u2019s next: Speech-to-Speech and Multimodal-to-Multimodal models\nAmazon will introduce an Amazon Nova speech-to-speech model in the first quarter of 2025. The model is designed to transform conversational AI applications by understanding streaming speech input in natural language, interpreting verbal and non-verbal cues (like tone and cadence), and delivering natural human-like, back-and-forth interactions with low latency.\nAmazon is also developing a novel model that can take text, images, audio, and video as input, and generate outputs in any of these modalities. This Amazon Nova model with native multimodal-to-multimodal \u2013 or \"any-to-any\" modality capabilities \u2013 will be introduced mid-year 2025. It will simplify the development of applications where the same model can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as translating content from one modality to another, editing content, and powering AI agents that can understand and generate all modalities.\nAWS partners and customers are already taking advantage of the capabilities and price-performance of Amazon Nova models\nSAP, a strategic partner of AWS, is integrating Amazon Nova models into its SAP AI Core generative AI hub\u2019s family of supported LLMs. This enables developers to create new skills for Joule, SAP\u2019s AI copilot, and securely build AI-driven solutions that harness the full business context captured in SAP data, enabling automation, personalization, and advanced solutions like supply chain planning.\nDeloitte, a strategic partner of AWS, is committed to delivering best-in-class generative AI services to global businesses across every sector.

Today\u2019s announcements help customers prevent factual errors due to hallucinations, orchestrate multiple AI-powered agents for complex tasks, and create smaller, task-specific models that can perform similarly to a large model at a fraction of the cost and latency.\nAutomated Reasoning checks is the first and only generative AI safeguard that helps prevent factual errors due to model hallucinations, opening up new generative AI use cases that demand the highest levels of precision.\nCustomers can use multi-agent collaboration to easily build and orchestrate multiple AI agents to solve problems together, expanding the ways customers can apply generative AI to address their most complex use cases.\nModel Distillation empowers customers to transfer specific knowledge from a large, highly capable model to a smaller, more efficient one that can be up to 500% faster and 75% less expensive to run.\nTens of thousands of customers use Amazon Bedrock today, with Moody\u2019s, PwC, and Robin AI among those leveraging these new capabilities to cost-effectively scale inference and push the limits of generative AI innovation.\n\"With a broad selection of models, leading capabilities that make it easier for developers to incorporate generative AI into their applications, and a commitment to security and privacy, Amazon Bedrock has become essential for customers who want to make generative AI a core part of their applications and businesses,\" said Dr. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of AI and Data at AWS. \"That is why we have seen Amazon Bedrock grow its customer base by 4.7x in the last year alone. Over time, as generative AI transforms more companies and customer experiences, inference will become a core part of every application. With the launch of these new capabilities, we are innovating on behalf of customers to solve some of the top challenges, like hallucinations and cost, that the entire industry is facing when moving generative AI applications to production.\"\nStory Continues\nAutomated Reasoning checks prevent factual errors due to hallucinations\nWhile models continue to advance, even the most capable ones can hallucinate, providing incorrect or misleading responses. Hallucinations remain a fundamental challenge across the industry, limiting the trust companies can place in generative AI. This is especially true for regulated industries, like healthcare, financial services, and government agencies, where accuracy is critical, and organizations need to audit to make sure models are responding appropriately. Automated Reasoning checks is the first and only generative AI safeguard that helps prevent factual errors due to hallucinations using logically accurate and verifiable reasoning. By increasing the trust that customers can place in model responses, Automated Reasoning checks opens generative AI up to new use cases where accuracy is paramount.\nAutomated reasoning is a branch of AI that uses math to prove something is correct. It excels when dealing with problems where users need precise answers to a topic that is large and complex, and that has a well-defined set of rules or collection of knowledge about the subject. AWS has a team of world-class automated reasoning experts who have used this technology over the last decade to improve experiences across AWS, like proving that permissions and access controls are implemented correctly to enhance security or checking millions of scenarios across Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) before deployment to ensure availability and durability remain protected.\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails makes it easy for customers to apply safety and responsible AI checks to generative AI applications, allowing customers to guide models to only talk about relevant topics. Accessible through Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, Automated Reasoning checks now allows Amazon Bedrock to validate factual responses for accuracy, produce auditable outputs, and show customers exactly why a model arrived at an outcome. This increases transparency and ensures that model responses are in line with a customer\u2019s rules and policies. For example, a health insurance provider that needs to ensure its generative AI-powered customer service application responds correctly to customer questions about policies could benefit from Automated Reasoning checks. To apply them, the provider uploads their policy information, and Amazon Bedrock automatically develops the necessary rules, guiding the customers to iteratively test it to ensure the model is tuned to the right response\u2014no automated reasoning expertise required. The insurance provider then applies the check, and as the model generates responses, Amazon Bedrock verifies them. If a response is incorrect, like getting the deductible wrong or flagging a procedure that is not covered, Amazon Bedrock suggests the correct response using information from the Automated Reasoning check.\nPwC, a global professional services firm, is using Automated Reasoning checks to create AI assistants and agents that are highly accurate, trustworthy, and useful to drive its clients\u2019 businesses to the leading edge. PwC incorporates Automated Reasoning checks into industry-specific solutions for clients in financial services, healthcare, and life sciences, including applications that verify AI-generated compliance content with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory standards. Internally, PwC employs Automated Reasoning checks to ensure that responses generated by generative AI assistants and agents are accurate and compliant with internal policies.\nEasily build and coordinate multiple agents to execute complex workflows\nAs companies make generative AI a core part of their applications, they want to do more than just summarize content and power chat experiences. They also want their applications to take action. AI-powered agents can help customers\u2019 applications accomplish these actions by using a model\u2019s reasoning capabilities to break down a task, like helping with an order return or analyzing customer retention data, into a series of steps that the model can execute. Amazon Bedrock Agents makes it easy for customers to build these agents to work across a company\u2019s systems and data sources. While a single agent can be useful, more complex tasks, like performing financial analysis across hundreds or thousands of different variables, may require a large number of agents with their own specializations. However, creating a system that can coordinate multiple agents, share context across them, and dynamically route different tasks to the right agent requires specialized tools and generative AI expertise that many companies do not have available. That is why AWS is expanding Amazon Bedrock Agents to support multi-agent collaboration, empowering customers to easily build and coordinate specialized agents to execute complex workflows.\nUsing multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock, customers can get more accurate results by creating and assigning specialized agents for specific steps of a project and accelerate tasks by orchestrating multiple agents working in parallel. For example, a financial institution could use Amazon Bedrock Agents to help carry out due diligence on a company before investing. First, the customer uses Amazon Bedrock Agents to create a series of specialized agents focused on specific tasks, like analyzing global economic factors, assessing industry trends, and reviewing the company\u2019s historical financials. After they have created all of their specialized agents, they create a supervisor agent to manage the project. The supervisor then handles the coordination, like breaking up and routing tasks to the right agents, giving specific agents access to the information they need to complete their work, and determining what actions can be processed in parallel and which need details from other tasks before the agent can move forward. Once all of the specialized agents complete their inputs, the supervisor agent pulls the information together, synthesizes the results, and develops an overall risk profile.\nMoody\u2019s, a global leader in credit ratings and financial insights, has chosen Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration to enhance its risk analysis workflows. Moody's is leveraging Amazon Bedrock to create agents that are each assigned a specific task and given access to tailored datasets to perform its role. For example, one agent might analyze macroeconomic trends, while another evaluates company-specific risks using proprietary financial data, and a third benchmarks competitive positioning. These agents collaborate seamlessly, synthesizing their outputs into precise, actionable insights. This innovative approach enables Moody\u2019s to deliver faster, more accurate risk assessments, solidifying its reputation as a trusted authority in financial decision-making.\nCreate smaller, faster, more cost-effective models with Model Distillation\nCustomers today are experimenting with a wide variety of models to find the one best suited to the unique needs of their business. However, even with all the models available today, it is challenging to find one with the right mix of specific knowledge, cost, and latency. Larger models are more knowledgeable, but they take longer to respond and cost more, while small models are faster and cheaper to run, but are not as capable. Model distillation is a technique that transfers the knowledge from a large model to a small model, while retaining the small model\u2019s performance characteristics. However, doing this requires specialized machine learning (ML) expertise to work with training data, manually fine-tune the model, and adjust model weights without compromising the performance characteristics that led the customer to choose the smaller model in the first place. With Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation, any customer can now distill their own model that can be up to 500% faster and 75% less expensive to run than original models, with less than 2% accuracy loss for use cases like retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Now, customers can optimize to achieve the best combination of capabilities, accuracy, latency, and cost for their use case\u2014no ML expertise required.\nWith Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation, customers simply select the best model for a given use case and a smaller model from the same model family that delivers the latency their application requires at the right cost. After the customer provides sample prompts, Amazon Bedrock will do all the work to generate responses and fine-tune the smaller model, and it can even create more sample data, if needed, to complete the distillation process. This gives customers a model with the relevant knowledge and accuracy of the large model, but the speed and cost of the smaller model, making it ideal for production use cases, like real-time chat interactions. Model Distillation works with models from Anthropic, Meta, and the newly announced Amazon Nova Models.\nRobin AI, which provides an AI-powered assistant that helps make complex legal processes quicker, cheaper, and more accessible, is using Model Distillation to help power high-quality legal Q&A across millions of contract clauses. Model Distillation helps Robin AI get the accuracy they need at a fraction of the cost, while faster responses provide a more fluid interaction between their customers and the assistant.\nAutomated Reasoning checks, multi-agent collaboration, and Model Distillation are all available in preview.\nTo learn more, visit:\nThe AWS Blog for details on today\u2019s announcements: Automated Reasoning checks, multi-agent collaboration, and Model Distillation.\nThe Amazon Bedrock page to learn more about the capabilities.\nThe Amazon Bedrock customer page to learn how companies are using Amazon Bedrock.\nThe AWS re:Invent page for more details on everything happening at AWS re:Invent.\nAbout Amazon Web Services\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

          "whole_article": "Amazon Aurora DSQL provides a distributed SQL database with 99.999% multi-Region availability, virtually unlimited scalability, strong consistency, and zero infrastructure management\nLAS VEGAS, December 03, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--At AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced new capabilities for Amazon Aurora and Amazon DynamoDB to support customers\u2019 most demanding workloads that need to operate across multiple Regions with strong consistency, low latency, and the highest availability whether they want SQL or NoSQL.\nAmazon Aurora DSQL is a new serverless, distributed SQL database that enables customers to build applications with the highest availability, strong consistency, PostgreSQL compatibility, and 4x faster reads and writes compared to other popular distributed SQL databases.\nAmazon DynamoDB global tables now supports multi-Region strong consistency, ensuring customers' multi-Region applications are always reading the latest data without having to change any application code.\nAWS customers, including Autodesk, Electronic Arts, Klarna, QRT, and Razorpay, are exploring Aurora DSQL to support their rapidly growing businesses.\n\"Databases are a foundational building block of every application, and customers rely on AWS databases to power their most critical workloads,\" said G2 Krishnamoorthy, vice president of Database Services at AWS. \"Over the years, we have innovated to provide customers with the widest range of high-performance and scalable databases, including Amazon Aurora, which hundreds of thousands of customers rely on every day. Aurora removes the need for customers to make trade-offs by providing the performance of enterprise grade commercial databases with the flexibility and economics of open source. Now, we\u2019re reimagining the relational database again to deliver strong consistency, global availability, and virtually unlimited scalability, without having to choose between low latency or SQL.\"\nAmazon Aurora DSQL enables highly resilient applications that meet the most stringent business continuity requirements\nAmazon Aurora is a cloud-native relational database that delivers all of the performance and capability of a high-end commercial database, with the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of an open source database. However, as customers increasingly build globally distributed, real-time applications with millions of end users around the world, they continue to push the limits of relational databases and want more from Aurora. They want a multi-Region database with low latency, strong consistency, high availability, and zero operational burden\u2014and it has to be SQL. The options available today force trade-offs. Some provide low latency and high availability, but not strong consistency or SQL compatibility. Others provide strong consistency and high availability, but can\u2019t avoid very high latency and still don\u2019t offer SQL compatibility. Now, customers no longer have to compromise with Aurora DSQL, the fastest distributed SQL database that delivers strong consistency, 4x faster reads and writes compared to other popular distributed SQL databases, 99.999% multi-Region availability, virtually unlimited scalability, and zero infrastructure management.\nStory Continues\nAurora DSQL\u2019s active-active architecture and automated failure recovery ensure that a customer\u2019s application is always available by enabling an application to read and write to any Aurora DSQL endpoint. All transactions written in one Region are reflected in other Regions with strong consistency. With Aurora DSQL, there is no need to provision, patch, or manage database instances, and all updates and security patching happen with no downtime and zero impact to performance. Aurora DSQL automatically scales to meet any workload demand without database sharding or instance upgrades, and can scale reads and writes independently, eliminating scaling bottlenecks while maintaining performance. Aurora DSQL is PostgreSQL compatible, offering an easy-to-use developer experience.\nTo make this possible, AWS had to reinvent relational database transaction processing. Aurora DSQL overcomes two historical challenges of distributed databases\u2014achieving multi-Region strong consistency with low latency, and syncing servers with microsecond accuracy around the globe. To achieve multi-Region strong consistency with low latency, Aurora DSQL decouples transaction processing from storage to overcome the limitations of the current approaches, which were constrained by information being passed back and forth multiple times at the speed of light. To overcome this, Aurora DSQL only checks each transaction at commit time and, on commit, parallelizes all the writes across all regions to provide a multi-Region database with strong consistency and fast writes. To ensure each Region sees every database operation in the exact order they occurred, Aurora DSQL uses Amazon Time Sync Service, which added hardware reference clocks on every Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, synchronizing them to satellite-connected atomic clocks to provide microseconds level accurate time within anywhere in the world. By solving these challenges, Amazon Aurora DSQL enables customers to build globally distributed applications on an entirely new scale.\nFor example, Razorpay, one of the largest fintech companies in India, is looking to use Aurora DSQL to power new fintech solutions, helping them create resilient applications that can rapidly scale to support the needs of their growing user base. Aurora DSQL will help Razorpay achieve multi-Region strong consistency, which is critical for financial use cases that require high degrees of precision, for their applications while operating more efficiently at a global scale.\nAmazon DynamoDB global tables now supports multi-Region strong consistency\nDynamoDB was the first fully managed, serverless, NoSQL database that transformed what internet-scale applications could achieve by redefining performance and simplifying operations with zero infrastructure management and consistent single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. Today, customers across virtually every industry and size are building and modernizing their critical applications by leveraging DynamoDB global tables, a multi-Region, multi-active database that provides 99.999% availability. AWS is now using the same underlying technology leveraged by Aurora DSQL to enhance DynamoDB global tables, adding the option of strong consistency to the highest availability, virtually unlimited scalability, and zero infrastructure management already available in DynamoDB global tables.\nAWS customer Reltio processes more than 9 billion customer profiles for market research and 60 billion API calls annually. In 2020, Reltio went all-in on Amazon DynamoDB to enhance the performance, scaling, and security of its database solution. Now, as Reltio continues to expand globally, the company plans to leverage multi-Region strong consistency in DynamoDB global tables to meet the stringent resilience and performance requirements of its growing customer base.\nBoth Amazon Aurora DSQL and multi-Region strong consistency in Amazon DynamoDB global tables are available in preview today.\nTo learn more, visit:\nThe AWS News Blog for details on today\u2019s announcements.\nThe Amazon Aurora and Amazon DynamoDB pages to learn more about these services.\nThe Amazon Aurora and Amazon DynamoDB customer pages to learn how companies are using these services.\nThe AWS re:Invent page for more details on everything happening at AWS re:Invent.\nAbout Amazon Web Services\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

AWS already offers the broadest and deepest selection of accelerated EC2 instances for AI/ML, including those powered by GPUs and ML chips. But even with the fastest accelerated instances available today, customers want more performance and scale to train these increasingly sophisticated models faster, at a lower cost. As model complexity and data volumes grow, simply increasing cluster size fails to yield faster training time due to parallelization constraints. Simultaneously, the demands of real-time inference push single-instance architectures beyond their capabilities.\nStory Continues\nTrn2 is the highest performing Amazon EC2 instance for deep learning and generative AI\nTrn2 offers 30-40% better price performance than the current generation of GPU-based EC2 instances. A single Trn2 instance combines 16 Trainium2 chips interconnected with ultra-fast NeuronLink high-bandwidth, low-latency chip-to-chip interconnect to provide 20.8 peak petaflops of compute, ideal for training and deploying models that are billions of parameters in size.\nTrn2 UltraServers meet increasingly demanding AI compute needs of the world\u2019s largest models\nFor the largest models that require even more compute, Trn2 UltraServers allow customers to scale training beyond the limits of a single Trn2 instance, reducing training time, accelerating time to market, and enabling rapid iteration to improve model accuracy. Trn2 UltraServers are a completely new EC2 offering that use ultra-fast NeuronLink interconnect to connect four Trn2 servers together into one giant server. With new Trn2 UltraServers, customers can scale up their generative AI workloads across 64 Trainium2 chips. For inference workloads, customers can use Trn2 UltraServers to improve real-time inference performance for trillion-parameter models in production. Together with Anthropic, AWS is building an EC2 UltraCluster of Trn2 UltraServers, named Project Rainier, which will scale out distributed model training across hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips interconnected with third-generation, low-latency petabit scale EFA networking\u2014more than 5x the number of exaflops that Anthropic used to train their current generation of leading AI models. When completed, it is expected to be the world\u2019s largest AI compute cluster reported to date available for Anthropic to build and deploy their future models on.\nAnthropic is an AI safety and research company that creates reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. Anthropic\u2019s flagship product is Claude, an LLM trusted by millions of users worldwide. As part of Anthropic\u2019s expanded collaboration with AWS, they\u2019ve begun optimizing Claude models to run on Trainium2, Amazon\u2019s most advanced AI hardware to date.

          "whole_article": "Amazon S3 Tables deliver up to 3x faster query performance and up to 10x higher transactions per second for analytics workloads; Amazon S3 Metadata delivers queryable object metadata in near real time to search, organize, and augment data to accelerate data discovery\nLAS VEGAS, December 03, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--At AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced new Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) features that make S3 the first cloud object store with fully-managed support for Apache Iceberg for faster analytics and the easiest way to store and manage tabular data at any scale. These new features also include the ability to automatically generate queryable metadata, simplifying data discovery and understanding to help customers unlock the value of their data in S3.\nAmazon S3 Tables is the first cloud object store with built-in Apache Iceberg table support and introduces a new bucket type to optimize storage and querying of tabular data as Iceberg tables, delivering up to 3x faster query performance, up to 10x higher transactions per second (TPS), and automated table maintenance and automation for analytics workloads.\nAmazon S3 Metadata streamlines data discovery in near real-time by automatically capturing queryable object metadata, as well as custom metadata using object tags, storing it in S3 Tables for accelerating analytics across data lakes.\n\"As the leading object store in the world with more than 400 trillion objects, S3 is used by millions of customers, and we continue to innovate to remove the complexity of working with data at an unprecedented scale,\" said Andy Warfield, vice president, Storage, and distinguished engineer, AWS. \"We have seen the rapid rise of tabular data and, increasingly, customers want to query across tables, improve query performance, and understand and organize troves of data so they can easily find exactly what they need. S3 Tables and S3 Metadata remove the overhead of organizing and operating table and metadata stores on top of objects, so customers can shift their focus back to building with their data.\"\nS3 Tables and S3 Metadata are Apache Iceberg table-compatible so customers can easily query their data using AWS analytics services and open source tools, including Amazon Athena, Amazon QuickSight, and Apache Spark.\nAmazon S3 Tables\u2014the easiest and fastest way to perform analytics on Apache Iceberg tables in S3\nMany customers today organize the data they use for analytics as tabular data, most often stored in Apache Parquet, a file format optimized for data queries. Parquet has become one of the fastest growing data types in S3, and customers increasingly want to be able to query these growing tabular data sets\u2014often turning to open table formats (OTF), an open source standard for storing data in tables\u2014because it helps organize, update, and track changes to large amounts of data. Iceberg has become the most popular OTFs to manage Parquet files, with customers using Iceberg to query across billions of files containing petabytes or even exabytes of data. However, Iceberg can be challenging for customers to manage as they scale, often requiring dedicated teams to build and maintain systems to handle table maintenance and data compaction, as well as manage access control. These external systems are costly and complex, and they require skilled teams to maintain, using up valuable resources.\nStory Continues\nAmazon S3 Tables are purpose-built for managing Apache Iceberg tables for data lakes. S3 Tables are specifically optimized for analytics workloads, delivering up to 3x faster query performance and 10x higher TPS compared to general purpose S3 buckets. S3 Tables automatically manage table maintenance tasks such as compaction for better query performance and snapshot management to continuously optimize query performance and storage costs, even as customers\u2019 data lakes scale and evolve. Customers can use S3 Tables by creating a table bucket that optimizes the storage and querying of tabular data in fully-managed Iceberg tables. With S3 Tables, customers benefit from Iceberg capabilities like row-level transactions, queryable snapshots via time travel functionality, schema evolution, and more. In addition, S3 Tables provide table-level access controls, allowing customers to define permissions.\nGenesys, a global leader in AI-powered experience orchestration, plans to leverage Amazon S3 for its data lake. By utilizing S3 Tables' managed Iceberg support, Genesys expects to offer a materialized view layer for its diverse data analysis needs. S3 Tables\u2019 built-in support for Iceberg tables will simplify complex data workflows by automating key maintenance tasks such as table compaction, snapshot management, and unreferenced file cleanup. Genesys is looking forward to improved performance and broad support from Iceberg-compliant analytics tools that can read and write Iceberg tables directly from S3. S3 Tables will be foundational to Genesys' future data strategy, enabling the company to deliver faster, more flexible, and reliable data insights to support its AI-driven customer and employee experience solutions.\nAmazon S3 Metadata\u2014the easiest and fastest way to discover and understand data in S3\nAs more customers use S3 as their central data repository, the volume and variety of data have grown exponentially, with metadata becoming increasingly important as a way to understand and organize large amounts of data so customers can find the exact objects they need. To address this problem, many customers resort to building and maintaining complex metadata capture and storage systems to enrich their understanding of data. But these metadata systems are expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, often requiring data engineers to manually track and update metadata as it flows through their processing pipelines, as well as data analysts to manually inspect massive object stores to find the specific data they need for analytics and AI/ML data processing workflows.\nAmazon S3 Metadata automatically generates queryable object metadata in near real-time to help accelerate data discovery and improve data understanding, eliminating the need for customers to build and maintain their own complex metadata systems. S3 Metadata lets customers query, find, and use data for business analytics, real-time inference applications, and more. S3 Metadata automatically generates object metadata, which includes system-defined details like size and source of the object, and makes it queryable via new S3 Tables. S3 Metadata updates object metadata in S3 Tables as objects are added or removed, giving customers an up-to-date view of their data. Customers can add their own custom metadata using object tags to annotate objects with information specific to their business, such as product SKUs, transaction IDs, or content ratings, or with customer details. Customers can easily query metadata using a simple SQL query, enabling them to quickly find and prepare data for use in business analytics and real-time inference applications, as well as fine-tune foundation models, perform retrieval augmented generation (RAG), integrate data warehouse and analytics workflows, perform targeted storage optimization tasks, and more.\nOrganizations of all sizes are set to benefit from the data discovery and understanding that S3 Metadata will bring. Roche, a leading biotech company, plans to leverage S3 Metadata to accelerate their future generative AI initiatives. As they develop advanced large language model (LLM) applications like sophisticated internal chatbots, they anticipate managing exponentially larger volumes of unstructured data for enhanced RAG. S3 Metadata will simplify the creation of a scalable metadata system, automatically surfacing and updating metadata as new data is ingested. Roche envisions using custom Lambda functions to extract complex, business-specific metadata, integrating it seamlessly with S3 Metadata in a comprehensive Glue catalog. This will enable more efficient organization and rapid identification of relevant datasets for cutting-edge AI applications, allowing Roche to focus on groundbreaking innovations in personalized healthcare.\nCambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT) is the world\u2019s largest telematics service provider. The company gathers sensor data from devices and enriches it with contextual data to create a unified view of vehicle and driver behavior that auto insurers, automakers, commercial mobility companies, and the public sector use to power risk assessment, safety, claims, and driver improvement programs. CMT stores and analyzes multiple petabytes of data from millions of IoT devices worldwide. As CMT scales, locating specific data for developing new insights and models becomes increasingly challenging. S3 Metadata, including system and custom metadata, allows CMT to query petabytes of metadata, making finding relevant data simple and cost-effective.\nS3 Tables (generally available) and S3 Metadata (preview) are available today. S3 Tables\u2019 integration with AWS Glue Data Catalog is in preview, allowing customers to query and visualize data\u2014including S3 Metadata tables\u2014using AWS Analytics services such as Amazon Athena, Redshift, EMR, and QuickSight.\nTo learn more, visit:\nS3 Tables and S3 Metadata AWS News Blog posts for details on today\u2019s announcements.\nS3 Tables and S3 Metadata product detail pages to learn more about their capabilities.\nS3 Tables and S3 Metadata videos for explanations on how they work.\nAbout Amazon Web Services\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 240 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 108 Availability Zones within 34 geographic regions, with announced plans for 18 more Availability Zones and six more AWS Regions in Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced that Twelve Labs, a startup that uses multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) to bring human-like understanding to video content, is building and scaling its proprietary foundation models on AWS. Twelve Labs will use AWS technologies to accelerate the development of its foundation models that map natural language to what\u2019s happening inside a video. This includes actions, objects, and background sounds, allowing developers to create applications that can search through videos, classify scenes, summarize, and split video clips into chapters.\nCreating applications that can pinpoint any video moment or frame\nAvailable on AWS Marketplace, these foundation models enable developers to create applications for semantic video search and text generation, serving media, entertainment, gaming, sports, and additional industries reliant on large volumes of video. For example, sports leagues can use the technology to streamline the process of cataloging vast libraries of game footage, making it easier to retrieve specific frames for live broadcasts. Additionally, coaches can use these foundation models to analyze a swimmer\u2019s stroke technique or a sprinter\u2019s starting block position, making adjustments that lead to better performance. Finally, media and entertainment companies can use Twelve Labs technology to create highlight reels from TV programs tailored to each viewer\u2019s interests, such as compiling all action sequences in a thriller series featuring a favorite actor.\n\"Twelve Labs was founded on a vision to help developers build multimodal intelligence into their applications,\" said Jae Lee, co-founder and CEO of Twelve Labs. \"Nearly 80% of the world\u2019s data is in video, yet most of it is unsearchable. We are now able to address this challenge, surfacing highly contextual videos to bring experiences to life, similar to how humans see, hear, and understand the world around us.\"\n\"AWS has given us the compute power and support to solve the challenges of multimodal AI and make video more accessible, and we look forward to a fruitful collaboration over the coming years as we continue our innovation and expand globally,\" added Lee. \"We can accelerate our model training, deliver our solution safely to thousands of developers globally, and control compute costs\u2014all while pushing the boundaries of video understanding and creation using generative AI.\"\nStory Continues\nGenerating accurate and insightful video summaries and highlights\nTwelve Labs\u2019 Marengo and Pegasus foundation models deliver groundbreaking video analysis that not only provides text summaries and audio translations in more than 100 languages, but also analyzes how words, images, and sounds all relate to one other, such as matching what\u2019s said in speech to what\u2019s shown in video. Content creators can also access exact moments, angles, or events within a show or game using natural language searches. For example, major sports leagues use Twelve Labs technology on AWS to automatically and rapidly create highlight reels from their extensive media libraries to improve the viewing experience and drive fan engagement.\n\"Twelve Labs is using cloud technology to turn vast volumes of multimedia data into accessible and useful content, driving improvements in a wide range of industries,\" said Jon Jones, vice president and global head of Startups at AWS. \"Video is a treasure trove of valuable information that has, until now, remained unavailable to most viewers. AWS has helped Twelve Labs build the tools needed to better understand and rapidly produce more relevant content.\"\nAccelerating and lowering the cost of model training\nTwelve Labs uses Amazon SageMaker HyperPod to train its foundation models, which are capable of comprehending different data formats like videos, images, speech, and text all at once. This allows its models to unlock deeper insights compared to other AI models focused on just one data type. The training workload is split across multiple AWS compute instances working in parallel, which means Twelve Labs can train their foundation models for weeks or even months without interruption. Amazon SageMaker HyperPod provides everything needed to get AI models up to speed quickly, fine-tune their performance, and scale up operations seamlessly.\nLeveraging the scale of AWS to expand globally\nAs part of a three-year Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA), Twelve Labs will work with AWS to deploy its advanced video understanding foundation models across new industries and enhance its model training capabilities using Amazon SageMaker Hyperpod. AWS Activate, a program that helps startups grow their business, has empowered Twelve Labs to scale its generative AI technology globally and unlock deeper insights from hundreds of petabytes of videos\u2014down to split-second accuracy. This support includes hands-on expertise for optimizing machine learning performance and implementing go-to-market strategies. Additionally, AWS Marketplace enables Twelve Labs to seamlessly deliver its innovative video intelligence services to a global customer base.\nAbout Amazon Web Services\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 240 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 108 Availability Zones within 34 geographic regions, with announced plans for 18 more Availability Zones and six more AWS Regions in Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine Netflix\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\nSee our latest analysis for Netflix\nWhat Is Netflix Worth?\nAccording to our valuation model, Netflix seems to be fairly priced at around 16.08% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Netflix today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $773.37, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Netflix\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from Netflix?\nNasdaqGS:NFLX Earnings and Revenue Growth December 3rd 2024\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Netflix. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NFLX\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NFLX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of Wells Fargo\u2019s Tech Stocks To Beat The S&P: 14 Top AI & Non-AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks.\nAs 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. They beckon 2025 with a rather historic run on the stock market that has seen several high-growth technology stocks flourish despite the fact that until September, interest rates in the US were at a two-decade high level.\nDriving the bullishness behind technology stocks is artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that relies on high-end GPUs to run advanced mathematical techniques and infer new conclusions from existing data sets has been the focus of Wall Street and big technology companies. So far, most of the AI-related stock gains have been limited to the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite graphics processing unit (GPU) company whose stock is up by more than\u00a0700%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nHowever, the gains have to broaden out to other stocks for the AI wave to continue. This broadening is dependent on the use of AI increasing among businesses and consumers. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo has some insights to share. In its report titled \u2018Generative AI \u2014 Potential pitfalls, challenges, and risks the bank outlines that while AI \u201chas the potential to be broadly transformative,\u201d there are several \u201coutstanding questions and concerns that need to be addressed before it is widely accepted on a larger scale.\u201d Quoting its \u2018The AI Index 2024 Annual Report,\u2019 the bank points out that from 2012 to 2023, the number of AI incidents has jumped more than tenfold from sitting at roughly 10 to ~122. These incidents cover the ethical misuse of AI such as the wrong detection of criminals stemming from facial recognition systems.\nWF\u00a0points\u00a0out that while these incidents are concerning, other factors will also determine AI\u2019s wider acceptability and use. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints. The bank adds that these factors are also accompanied by the potentially transformative effect of AI on the labor market. Starting from its beliefs about the labor market, WF believes that generative AI, which is different from other AI systems such as machine learning, will have a more \u201cnuanced\u201d impact on the labor market compared to traditional AI. Commenting on common worries of AI taking jobs away, the bank outlines that the jobs that AI will replace will in turn be replaced by new jobs created by AI. To quote WF, it believes \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s disruptive effect on the labor market to mirror other forms of automation \u2014 as in the past, its impact likely will be mitigated over time by new occupations spawned by the innovations themselves.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTo help bolster its claim, WF shares data from MIT. It points out that MIT\u2019s estimates show that \u201c60% of U.S. workers are now employed in occupations that did not exist 84 years ago.\u201d As for which job functions might give way to AI, these include knowledge-based roles such as those found in financial services and support roles such as those performed by customer support agents.\nTwo additional key disruptive AI effects that Wall Street in particular is keenly aware of are its rising costs and the effect on the utility industry. The S&P\u2019s utility sector is up by 28.36% year-to-date which leads the broader index\u2019s 26.48% in gains by nearly two percentage points. Commenting on this, the bank believes that \u201cthere will be a significant increase in hardware demand, notably within the data-center environment, to accommodate the substantial increase in AI workloads,\u201d adding that \u201cit may take a number of years to increase the operational efficiency of various large language models and decrease costs to a level more in-line with existing search engines.\u201d WF also shares that while existing opportunities to expand data center footprint to accommodate AI are present, as they \u201cdiminish, companies may revisit existing data-center locations to retrofit and upgrade hardware and infrastructure in support of the power and data-consumption needs of new AI technologies.\u201d\nGiven the criticality of the data center space to AI, WF expands on this sector in another\u00a0report. Titled \u2018Generative AI transforming data center landscape\u201d it comments on the capital expenditure required to set up data centers, future trends for data centers, and the stock market sectors that might benefit from growing interest and focus on the data center industry. According to its analysis, investor attention is mostly focused on AI-related investments in semiconductors and cloud computing.\nHowever, other sectors, such as \u201ccabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators\u201d are also important. WF quotes a utility company to explain why these tertiary sectors are critical in the AI wave. It shares that utility company believes that \u201cthe server rack power density required to train a generative-AI-based large language model can require up to five to seven times more power than server racks used for traditional IT workloads in a data center.\u201d\nWhile semiconductor companies are natural beneficiaries of the AI boom, some oft-ignored sectors that WF mentions are industrials and materials. It outlines that when it comes to building massive data centers, estimates suggest \u201cthat approximately 35% \u2013 45% of the cost is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out. These areas are addressable by companies who supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors).\u201d Additionally, \u201c40% \u2013 45% and 15% \u2013 20% of the remaining cost can be attributed to electrical and HVAC systems respectively,\u201d according to Wells Fargo. AI is having an effect on materials, as per the bank, in the form of \u201cincreased demand for materials that are used in the production of semiconductor chips, water handling and recycling within data centers, and steel and construction materials to build data centers.\u201d\nFor some materials stocks and a primer on how they are reliant on the broader economic activity, you can check out\u00a010 Best Materials Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s top AI & non-AI stocks that can outpace the flagship S&P, we selected technology-focused stocks from the bank\u2019s recent Focus List and ranked them by their consensus next twelve-month EPS estimates.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 121\nNTM EPS Estimate: $22.77\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the world\u2019s biggest video streaming company. It enjoys a wide moat in the industry and is the market leader. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s market position has enabled it to amass a whopping 282.7 million subscribers under its belt. This subscriber base is the key to the firm\u2019s hypothesis, as its fate now depends on the ability to monetize the user base, retain its customers, and add new users into its fold. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also benefits from the fact that it produces television shows and movies, which sets it apart by offering exclusive content to its subscribers. The ability to take on traditional television channels and bolster its user base is central to creating tailwinds as is evident by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s 6.5% share price gain since the historic fight between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul which saw 60 million household worldwide tune into its platform.\nEnsemble Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cThe rapid recovery of Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth has shocked investors who drove the stock down to a price of just $166 in May 2022. While at the time, bearish investors were declaring the company\u2019s growth days were behind it, instead the company added a remarkable 13.1 million new subscribers in the most recent quarter. This was the single largest quarterly subscriber addition other than the large gains experienced during the first quarter of COVID. For all of 2023, the company added nearly 30 million new subscribers, making it the largest annual gain in Netflix history other than the first year of COVID.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 2nd on our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks. NFLX\u00a0 is a top cyclical stock Wells Fargo is confident about. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

The new price target reflects a 32X multiple on their 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $30.\nEvercore highlighted that the company is seeing significant upside potential, with a mid-single-digit percentage increase to street 2026 EPS estimates.\nThe firm noted that Netflix could see even more substantial gains if it returns to its historical price increase cadence.\nHowever, they caution that the $950 price target doesn't imply dramatic near-term upside, and Netflix remains a \"relatively small buy\" for them at current levels.\nThe positive survey results, which include data from the U.S., France, and Germany, are said to underscore Netflix's competitive edge in the streaming industry.\n\"Netflix is in the strongest position financially, fundamentally, and competitively that we have ever seen,\" the firm stated. Key drivers are said to include improved churn intent and price sensitivity results across all three markets, which bode well for its subscription business.\nFour major catalysts for Netflix in the near term include Christmas Day NFL games, the much-anticipated release of Squid Games II on December 26, WWE Raw in January, and upcoming price increases.\nEvercore also noted that Netflix continues to expand its competitive lead in terms of content quality and is gaining traction with its live sports and stand-up comedy offerings.\nWith the firm\u2019s positive outlook on Netflix\u2019s ability to sustain its growth, it remains confident in the stock\u2019s future prospects.\nRelated Articles\nNetflix stock target raised at Evercore on 'very strong catalyst path'\nIntel CEO Gelsinger forced out after board lost confidence in turnaround plan\nFirst Solar shares climb on raised target, positive outlook\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Ryan Serhant isn\u2019t your typical startup founder. That became obvious when a Netflix crew filmed our interview, which surprisingly is not a regular occurrence for Term Sheet. But as I learned while trying not to be distracted by the drone flying out of Serhant\u2019s office window capturing wide shots, his fame is a feature, not a bug.\nMaybe you recognize Serhant\u2019s name from Million Dollar Listing or his new Netflix show, Owning Manhattan. Or maybe you\u2019ve bought an apartment from the man himself or one of his rapidly growing army of brokers, all operating under his eponymous real estate empire, which closed the sixth most residential sales in Manhattan last year, according to the Real Deal.\u00a0(Serhant tells me he\u2019s opening in a new market roughly every 14 days.)\nBut now, Serhant wants to position himself as a tech entrepreneur, raising $45 million from the respected New York venture firms Camber Creek and Left Lane Capital and launching an app called S.MPLE, designed to help brokers navigate their sales.\nMost software founders gain celebrity because of the success of their products, but from his flagship headquarters in SoHo, which greets guests with a massive statue of an S right inside the front door, Serhant makes a convincing case for why the reverse can also be true.\nThrough his reality shows and millions of social media followers, Serhant helped pioneer a new form of real estate sales, where brokers find buyers through virality rather than staid listings in newspapers and Craigslist. His average agent is 20 years younger than the industry average. \u201cThey only know their business through social media,\u201d he tells me. The number one lead generator? LinkedIn.\nSerhant describes S.MPLE as \u201cInstacart for salespeople\u201d (See, he really is one of you.) It wasn\u2019t his first foray into developing real estate-focused tech, including an aborted metaverse platform called UNIVERS and a real-time video editing app called Spaces, which never took off with his agents. \u201cI used to call them missteps,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to go through that process.\u201d\nS.MPLE came as a learning from his second attempt\u2014that people want to spend less time on their screens, rather than more. The app allows brokers to automate parts of their sales process, from listings to communication. Rather than your typical SaaS product though, the real innovation\u2014like Serhant\u2019s brokerage business\u2014is his distribution funnel. Every aspect of his operation, from social media to reality TV to actual real estate sales\u2014works as a flywheel to generate more business. \u201cOur customer acquisition cost is near zero,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIf a significant amount of your dollars are going to Meta ad spend or figuring out how to take a product and create distribution, it's just a rough race.\u201d\nStory Continues\nSerhant says that he\u2019s been profitable from the beginning and that he\u2019s bringing venture investors on board because of the help they can provide from a strategic partnership perspective, with Left Lane Capital known for its consumer-focused portfolio and Camber Creek focused on property technology. Both firms recognized Serhant\u2019s \u201cinherent value,\u201d as Left Lane Capital\u2019s Harley Miller describes it. \u201cIt's made investors like us wake up to the power of this distribution and how big of a value driver and unique competitive moat it can be,\u201d Miller tells me.\nJeffrey Berman, general partner at Camber Creek, says that the most successful firms in his portfolio have \u201ccracked the code\u201d of the business-to-business-to-consumer model. He points to the rent payment platform Flex, which deals with multi-family-owner operators who can market to tenants en masse. \u201cIt's not apples to apples with the idea of having a socially recognizable personality, but it's similar in terms of the ability to [market] at a relatively low cost,\u201d he says.\nFor now, Serhant is rolling S.MPLE out to brokers across his own company and plans to expand to other outfits. His software ambitions may not supersede his Netflix renown anytime soon, but that might only aid his efforts. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a quote-unquote celebrity broker,\u201d Berman tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s actually a technology CEO, and he\u2019s running a pretty big company at that.\u201d\nLeo Schwartz\nTwitter: @leomschwartz\nEmail: leo.schwartz@fortune.com\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\nNina Ajemian curated the deals section of today\u2019s newsletter.

(NASDAQ:MGNI) stands against the other best Adtech stocks to buy.\nAs per Dimension Market Research, the Global\u00a0AdTech market\u00a0size touched\u00a0US$1,066.8 billion in 2023\u00a0and should reach US$3,528.4 billion by 2032. The market is expected to compound at ~14.2% from 2024 to 2032.\u00a0Some of the critical trends include a strong emphasis on privacy-centric advertising, growth fueled by AI-driven personalization, and dominance of video and mobile advertising.\nKey Trends Defining the AdTech Market\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning continue to drive sophisticated audience segmentation and personalized ad experiences. As per Geomotiv, a software development company, these technologies can quickly analyze vast amounts of data, predict user behavior, and tailor ads in real time. Collectively, these features help to improve engagement and conversion rates. The benefits of personalization and the opportunities provided should drive the demand for these solutions and the growth of AI-oriented AdTech companies.\nMarket experts believe that advertisers continue to target Programmatic advertising. This space continues to expand beyond traditional digital channels. Adnimation, a software company, highlighted that CTV ad spending is expected to grow to\u00a0$42.4 billion by 2027\u00a0in the US. Publishers that have video content should prioritize CTV and\u00a0find for best supply-side platform (SSP)\u00a0to tap into a rapidly growing market.\nAdvertisers have been leveraging programmatic to reach the audiences with targeted ads. Furthermore, programmatic continues to make inroads into the audio format, such as podcasts and music streaming services. Next, AdTech SaaS companies have been providing customizable solutions, which enable advertisers to tailor the tools and features as per the specific needs. The popularity of these products continues to grow among advertisers and publishers.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\nBlockchain and\u00a0Influencer Marketing Should Drive Growth\nAs per Adnimation, data-driven influencer marketing is expected to dominate the broader AdTech market. Furthermore, the publishers and their AdTech counterparts continue collaborating with micro-influencers to fuel engagement and conversions. \u00a0Blockchain technology should also be key in ensuring transparency in digital ad transactions. By decentralizing ad transactions, blockchain can help reduce ad fraud, improve trust between publishers and advertisers, and enable accurate tracking of ad performance. This will result in more reliable revenue streams. Adnimation also believes that, by 2025, video is expected to dominate digital ad formats, making up\u00a082% of all internet traffic.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo list the 11 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we scanned through online rankings and AdTech-focused ETFs. After getting the initial list of 20-25 stocks, we shortlisted the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the shortlisted stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:MGNI) offers online advertising solutions. The company is a leading independent sell-side advertising platform that specializes in programmatic advertising throughout multiple channels. Wall Street believes that Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s expertise lies in connected TV (CTV), which remains the fastest-growing segment of digital advertising. The optimism around the company further strengthened when it got selected as the partner to power the Netflix ad-supported tier sale. The collaboration is expected to have a substantial impact on Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s future revenues.\nBofA Securities\u00a0analyst Omar Dessouky\u00a0believes that the Netflix partnership should result in a $30-million revenue run rate by 2025 end.\u00a0 Furthermore, the analyst believes that the Netflix partnership should be able to contribute $44 million/$69 million/$199 million\u00a0to Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s revenue in 2026, 2027, and 2028. Industry experts believe that Netflix should become the company\u2019s largest CTV customer, which should help it offset any weakness from other partnerships.\nAs Netflix's ad-supported tier grows, Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) is expected to see improved revenue without proportional increases in costs. This should result in higher profitability. Furthermore, the company\u2019s growth momentum is expected to be aided by its CTV advertising segment, which should see strong ad spend growth and programmatic adoption.\nMagnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s partnership with Disney got a\u00a02-year extension, which further strengthens a 6-year collaboration.\u00a0As a result of this, Magnite will help in monetizing Disney\u2019s vast ad-supported content, spanning more than 30 DSPs. Courtesy of this high-profile content, the expanded relationship gives Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) a strong standing in premium advertising.\nChoice Equities Capital Management, a hedge fund manager, recently released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMagnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) and CROX \u2013 Magnite, Inc. and Croc\u2019s Inc. remain holdings in the portfolio and were recently discussed in detail on the Yet Another Value Blog podcast, which can be found here: YAVB podcast. As discussed herein, both remain well-positioned in their respective industries and represent attractive values on anticipated cash flows in years to come. Magnite, as highlighted, looks attractive on its own merits, though shares could become particularly interesting should a handful of industry anti-trust events break their way.\u201d\nOverall, MGNI ranks 8th on our list of best AdTech stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MGNI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Roku (ROKU). Shares have added about 5.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Roku due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nROKU Q3 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Revenues Increase Y/Y\nRoku reported third-quarter 2024 loss of 6 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents. The company had incurred a loss of $2.33 per share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues increased 16.47% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to $1.062 billion and beat the consensus mark by 4.37%. Growth of The Roku Channel\u2019s streaming households and streaming hours drove third-quarter performance. Roku\u2019s streaming households and streaming hours grew 13% and 20%, respectively, year over year.\n\nStreaming Households were 85.5 million, representing a net increase of 2 million from the second quarter of 2024. The Roku Home Screen, which is the beginning of viewers\u2019 streaming experience, reaches U.S. households with more than 120 million people every day, reflecting greater engagement and more monetization opportunities.\n\nThe Roku operating system (OS) was again the #1 selling TV OS in the United States, with TV unit sales greater than the next two TV operating systems combined. The Roku OS was also the #1 selling TV OS in Mexico and Canada.\n\nGlobally, users streamed a record 32 billion hours in the third quarter, up 20% hours from the prior quarter.\n\nThe average revenue per user remained flat year over year at $41.1 (on a trailing 12-month basis).\n\nThe Roku Channel remained the #3 app on Roku\u2019s platform in the third quarter by both reach and engagement, with Streaming Hours up nearly 80% year over year. This ongoing growth is largely due to the company\u2019s position as the lead-in to TV and Home Screen\u2019s power to drive viewership. The Roku Channel\u2019s Nielsens\u2019 The Gauge hit an all-time high ranking for August 2024, representing 4.1% of total TV streaming time in the United States. Roku launched Roku Sports Channel in August providing viewers with free sports content. Good Morning Football: Overtime, a new extension series of NFL Network\u2019s long-running Good Morning Football was also added to the Roku Channel.\nQuarter Details\nPlatform revenues (85.5% of revenues) increased 15.43% year over year to $908.2 million, driven by contributions from streaming services distribution and advertising activities, despite continued softness within the media and entertainment vertical.\n\nDevices revenues (14.5% of revenues) rose 23% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to $154 million.\nStory Continues\nOperating Details\nGross margin, as a percentage of total revenues, expanded 476 basis points from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to 45.2%.\n\nOperating expenses decreased 28.22% year over year to $515.83 million. As a percentage of total revenues, the metric contracted to 48.56% from 78.79% reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nResearch & development and sales & marketing expenses decreased 36.64% and 22.96% on a year-over-year basis to $178.79 million and $237.04 million, respectively. General & administrative expenses increased 22.3% to $99.9 million.\n\nIn the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $98.2 million against adjusted EBITDA of $43.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Roku reported the fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and trailing 12-month free cash flow.\n\nOperating loss was $35.8 million in the reported quarter compared with an operating loss of $349.8 million in the year-ago quarter.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $2.12 billion compared with $2.05 billion as of June 30, 2024. As of Sept 30, 2024, Roku had no long-term debt.\nGuidance\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, ROKU expects total net revenues of $1.14 billion, total gross profit of roughly $465 million and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.\nVGM Scores\nCurrently, Roku has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nRoku has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\nPerformance of an Industry Player\nRoku is part of the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry. Over the past month, Netflix (NFLX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 16.1%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2024 more than a month ago.\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of B.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Find out when Sabrina Carpenter hosts a holiday variety music special that streams on Netflix starting Friday, Dec. 6. \u201cIt\u2019s an hour of literal nonsense,\u201d Sabrina told Time magazine about the special. \u201cIf people are expecting boring, me singing by a tree, it\u2019s not that.

Chinese-owned NetEase Games is hoping to shake up the genre by adding superheroes and villains to the formula with Marvel Rivals. The core competition is a battle between two teams of six heroes each. The initial lineup includes marquee names like Spider-Man, Black Panther and Captain America as well as a few cult favorites like Luna Snow and Jeff the Land Shark. Some characters \u2014 say Thor, Loki and Hela \u2014 can join forces to unleash all sorts of havoc. It\u2019s all free-to-play, and the mayhem begins Friday, Dec. 6, on PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.\n\u2014 Lou Kesten\nView Comments"

CEO Lip-Bu Tan, according to people familar with the situation.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAs Wars Rage, Cities Face a Dark New Era of Urban Destruction\nRiyadh Metro Partially Opens in Bid to Ease City\u2019s Traffic Jams\nThe company has enlisted executive search firm Spencer Stuart to help find a new chief and is evaluating candidates, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. That includes looking well beyond Intel\u2019s walls for talent \u2014 a break with tradition.\nThis week\u2019s sudden ouster of CEO Pat Gelsinger set off an urgent search for new leadership at a time when the chipmaker\u2019s fortunes are shaky and its bench has been depleted by years of management turnover. Gelsinger took the reins just three years ago, and since then has focused on a complex, expensive effort to turn the struggling company around.\nThat didn\u2019t give him time to resurrect one of Intel\u2019s other legacies \u2014 an executive training program that once supplied leaders for the rest of the industry. For now, Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner and Executive Vice President Michelle Johnston Holthaus are serving as interim co-CEOs.\nMarvell shares slipped as much as 2.3% on Tuesday after Bloomberg News reported that Murphy was under consideration. Intel fell more than 5% as of 1:09 p.m. in New York, continuing a retreat that began Monday.\nAll but one of the company\u2019s leaders since its foundation in 1968 have been homegrown, and the exception, Bob Swan, was given the job as a stopgap measure when the board was forced to remove Brian Krzanich. That drama broke a run of carefully choreographed successions that contributed to the company\u2019s five decades of stability. Krzanich\u2019s tenure also saw the departure of a number of Intel veterans.\nAs the board hunts for Gelsinger\u2019s permanent replacement, analysts say, it may be hard-pressed to choose from within, partly because the earlier exodus means there are fewer strong internal candidates. On the other hand, there\u2019s little optimism that the company will be able to bring in an external savior who can shake things up immediately.\n\u201cIt may be challenging to find a replacement with the right experience and background, with the capacity to manage a complex organization such as Intel and able to effectively deal with the multitude of headwinds,\u201d KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh wrote in a note Monday.\nStory Continues\nIntel declined to comment on potential candidates for the CEO role. Marvell, Murphy and Tan didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters previously reported that the 65-year-old Tan, who served on Intel\u2019s board until earlier this year, was in contention for the job.\nOne way to balance the insider-outsider equation would be to hire an old Intel executive who left during the management tumult of recent years \u2014 like Gelsinger.\nSuch candidates would include Stacy Smith, a former Intel executive who joined the company\u2019s board this year. The ex-Intel CFO, who also spent time in the company\u2019s sales organization, exited during Krzanich\u2019s tenure in 2018 and was a previous applicant for the top job. A more recent departure is Gregory Bryant, who ran Intel\u2019s personal computer unit. He joined Analog Devices Inc. in 2022.\nAlso in this cohort is Ampere Computing LLC CEO Renee James, who created a startup that is trying to rival Intel in server chips. She served as Intel\u2019s president until sidelined by Krzanich. Former Lenovo Group Ltd. executive Kirk Skaugen, who left Intel in 2016, was in charge of Intel\u2019s server chip unit when it dominated the industry.\nAnother potential recruitment pool: Intel\u2019s biggest customers, many of which have embarked on their own chip programs with various levels of success. Johny Srouji is the senior vice president of Apple Inc.\u2019s successful internal chip unit. The iPhone maker\u2019s in-house program started a trend that\u2019s been replicated elsewhere, most notably by Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS unit. Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. have also built significant chip teams.\nWhen Intel was trying to bring Gelsinger back to the company about four years ago, some other chip company leaders, including Marvell\u2019s Murphy, were reported as being under consideration. Intel has now approached him for the latest search, the people said.\nDespite a severe decline in its fortunes, Intel remains one of the most important companies in the technology industry. It still ranks among the largest chipmakers by revenue, and more than 70% of the world\u2019s personal computers and server machines run on its processors. Its plan to build additional factories in the US is a cornerstone of the federal government\u2019s push to make more chips on American soil.\nWhomever Intel chooses, the new CEO will need time to make up for the more than $20 billion of revenue lost to competitors over the last couple of years.\n\u201cIn addition to no bench, a new outside CEO coming to Intel is a multiyear gig that is a tall order in a cycle of innovation that is more intense than ever,\u201d said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann.\nGiven the technical nature of the industry \u2014 chip design and manufacturing requires a blend of electronic engineering, chemistry and physics that is usually led by teams of Ph.D.s \u2013 Intel may be reluctant to promote CFO Zinsner on a permanent basis. When CFO Swan was the company\u2019s interim leader, analysts questioned whether he understood the technical side of the business well enough to make strategic decisions.\nGelsinger, who was brought back to Intel after a decade away, talked up his bonds to the company\u2019s past and his plan to restore its strengths. Now, that may no longer be a selling point. The immediate need to win over Intel\u2019s competitors and turn them into customers for its outsourced manufacturing business might involve excluding long-term Intel acolytes.\nIf the board is looking for the most immediately transferable skills, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. would be the most obvious talent pools. During the company\u2019s last CEO search, AMD\u2019s Lisa Su was mentioned as a favorite pick by many analysts. But since then, the company she runs has risen to greater levels of success, taking market share from Intel and emerging as the top contender to catch Nvidia in artificial intelligence chips. AMD is currently worth more than twice as much as Intel by market capitalization.\nRecruiting from Nvidia could also be difficult. Co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has created a unique management structure that eschews a traditional hierarchy. Huang has dozens of direct reports in a horizontal structure, making it almost impossible to identify who among them might be best positioned to take a step up \u2014 at Nvidia or at another company like Intel.\nTaiwan\u2019s TSMC, meantime, has blown past Intel in manufacturing capabilities and made itself the leading producer of chips for other companies. It manufactures the world\u2019s most advanced chips, working for Apple, AMD, Nvidia and a host of others. At the head office in Hsinchu, executives regarded as instrumental in steering TSMC\u2019s meteoric ascent include Intel veteran Kevin Zhang and his peer deputy Co-Chief Operating Officer Cliff Hou. In the US, TSMC Arizona CEO Y.L. Wang recently scored a notable triumph, helping that plant achieve better yields than its comparable facility back at home.\nIt\u2019s uncertain, however, if senior TSMC leaders would consider jettisoning the world\u2019s best contract chipmaker to go save a much less stable company. But former TSMC Chair Mark Liu, who spent some early years of his career at Intel and retired from the Taiwanese chipmaker earlier in 2024, may be someone that Intel can lure over \u2014 even though he is older than an average American CEO. Liu turns 70 this year.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect it to be easy for Intel to find a new leader with the credentials to lead Intel out of this challenge,\u201d Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso wrote in a report. \u201cGelsinger came with a wealth of Intel experience, and there hadn\u2019t been many viable candidates.\u201d\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n(Updates with Marvell shares in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

The limitations overlay on current U.S. policies prohibiting Nvidia from exporting its high-performance GPUsincluding the A100 and H100 modelsto China. Furthermore forbidden under the new U.S. regulations are custom chips created for the Chinese market, including the H800.\nTogether, the export prohibition and regulatory limits lower Nvidia's addressable market in China, a major source of income. Limited supplies might also result in more production expenses, therefore influencing profit margins.\nThe constraints are projected to cause supply chain problems and higher prices for the semiconductor business and other industries depending on these minerals, including military and renewable energy. The circumstances draw attention to rising conflicts between the United States and China over resources and technology.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

AAPL at $3.622 trillion. Joining the exclusive $3 trillion club alongside Microsoft Corporation MSFT, NVIDIA\u2019s remarkable ascent raises the question: Is there still room for growth, or has it peaked?\nThe AI Revolution: NVIDIA\u2019s Core Growth Engine\nNVIDIA\u2019s meteoric rise is anchored in its leadership in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI. As businesses increasingly adopt AI to boost productivity, demand for NVIDIA\u2019s advanced graphic processing units (GPUs), which power these applications, has surged.\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to skyrocket to $967.6 billion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024. This rapid expansion makes NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs indispensable for companies investing in AI infrastructure.\nNVIDIA\u2019s cutting-edge technology delivers unmatched computational power, enabling large-scale AI models to perform intricate calculations. With generative AI applications spanning industries such as healthcare, automotive and manufacturing, NVIDIA is positioned to dominate this space for years.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Diversified Growth Across Industries\nNVIDIA\u2019s influence extends well beyond AI.

In healthcare, NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are revolutionizing medical diagnostics, enhancing imaging processes and improving patient care. This broad, multi-industry applicability positions NVIDIA as a resilient and diverse growth engine in the tech landscape.\nMoreover, NVIDIA\u2019s robust data center solutions are gaining traction. As companies invest in cloud and edge computing, demand for powerful data center infrastructure rises, making NVIDIA\u2019s data center business a critical growth driver. This sector alone is projected to significantly boost the company\u2019s revenues as businesses accelerate their digital transformation efforts, solidifying NVIDIA\u2019s long-term growth potential.\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA\u2019s Robust Financial Performance Highlights Strength\nNVIDIA\u2019s financial results underscore its dominance. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported a staggering 94% year-over-year revenue increase, paired with a 103% jump in non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS). For the fourth quarter, management expects revenues to soar to $37.5 billion, up from $22.1 billion in the prior-year quarter.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues and earnings points to sustained growth, reflecting confidence in the company\u2019s market leadership across multiple sectors, including gaming, automotive and professional visualization.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis financial prowess is reflected in NVIDIA\u2019s strong balance sheet. As of Oct. 27, 2024, the company held $38.4 billion in cash, up from $34.8 billion on July 28. Over the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA generated $47.5 billion in operating cash flow and $45.2 billion in free cash flow.\nThis financial stability not only supports ongoing innovation but also provides a cushion against market volatility, ensuring NVIDIA can capitalize on emerging opportunities.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Discounted Valuation Amid Growth\nDespite its remarkable run, NVIDIA\u2019s valuation remains attractive. The stock trades at a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.15, below the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry average of 37.83. This suggests the stock is trading at a relative discount, offering potential upside for investors.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA: In a Nutshell\nNVIDIA\u2019s 180% YTD surge is impressive, but its growth trajectory is far from over. The company\u2019s leadership in AI, diversified applications and robust financial performance position it as a cornerstone of the semiconductor and technology sectors.\nFor investors seeking exposure to the AI revolution and beyond, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity. The stock\u2019s long-term prospects and attractive valuation make it a must-buy for those looking to ride the wave of technological innovation.\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B.

Now, Wall Street wants proof that the heavy spending is going to pay off.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAs Wars Rage, Cities Face a Dark New Era of Urban Destruction\nRiyadh Metro Partially Opens in Bid to Ease City\u2019s Traffic Jams\nThe maker of customer relations management software is due to report results after the close, with investors particularly focused on any comments on AI-related trends going forward. Salesforce (CRM) launched its Agentforce generative AI product in October, and has been hiring aggressively to sell the tool, which can complete tasks like customer support without human supervision. It also recently acquired Tenyx, a developer of AI-powered voice agents.\n\u201cAgentforce has overtaken the CRM narrative by storm with a marketing/product release blitz and positive but early partner feedback,\u201d wrote Citi analyst Tyler Radke. The results could offer \u201ca reality check\u201d after the stock\u2019s nearly 30% gain since Salesforce\u2019s annual Dreamforce event in September, he said.\nShares fell 1.9% on Tuesday.\nWhile AI has been a major driver of Wall Street gains for almost two years, the biggest revenue boost has been at chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. and cloud-computing companies like Microsoft Corp. Investors are betting that software will be the next group to benefit in a big way, and Salesforce is a popular candidate to show upside. The company has long focused on the technology and optimism around Agentforce is especially strong.\n\u201cWe see the new AI suite as being one of the most transformational to a large business as any we\u2019ve seen,\u201d wrote Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, in emailed comments. \u201cThe market will be very pleased when they see the adoption rates over the next three years.\u201d\nStill, the rollout and initial usage of Salesforce\u2019s AI products could be lumpy, he said, recommending investors use any share-price volatility as a buying opportunity. In three years time, \u201cthe stock will look much cheaper than it does now once we see the revenue, margin, and EPS ramp,\u201d he added.\nThe third-quarter results come after a tumultuous year for the shares, which plunged in May following a weak sales growth forecast which underscored concerns that it was getting left behind in AI. The stock has climbed almost 50% since then, and its most recent results were well received, with an estimate-beating outlook driven by cost cutting.\nWhile the shares have recovered, analysts haven\u2019t yet boosted their estimates in a big way. The consensus estimate for the company\u2019s net 2025 earnings is basically unchanged over the past quarter, the period over which the management team began to talk up the new AI tools. The forecast for revenue is similarly flat over that period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nStory Continues\nThe combination of share-price gains and static estimates has pushed Salesforce\u2019s valuation higher. The stock trades around 30 times estimated forward earnings, up from an all-time low of 21 in May. It\u2019s also now more expensive than the Nasdaq 100 Index\u2019s multiple of almost 27.\nStill, if Salesforce is able to show investors that Agentforce and other AI products will begin to provide a big tailwind next year, the shares may be able to continue on their hot streak.\nFeedback for the technology has been good, according to JPMorgan\u2019s most recent quarterly survey of Salesforce partners. \u201cAgentforce captivates customers, highlights the art of the possible in AI,\u201d analysts including Mark Murphy wrote, adding that the product debuted with the joint-highest all-time score among Salesforce products in the survey.\nFor this quarter, however, expectations may be too high, according to Murphy. \u201cAgentforce, while a critical development, is unlikely to materially move the needle on revenue growth for about a year,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t uncommon to see some backing and filling around earnings reports when excitement has mounted for an AI product cycle.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nWhen Pat Gelsinger was named Intel\u2019s CEO in January 2021, there was widespread optimism that he would be able to right the ship at the troubled chipmaker. Those hopes have not come to pass. The stock has slumped about 55% since Gelsinger\u2019s appointment, and his tenure ended with him being forced out after the board lost confidence in his turnaround plans. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index is up almost 70% over that same period, while Nvidia has soared more than 900%.\nTop Tech Stories\nSpaceX is in discussions to sell insider shares that could boost the value of Elon Musk\u2019s rocket and satellite company to around $350 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe abrupt departure of Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger offers a fresh opportunity for the troubled company to consider potential deal options, including scenarios that he rejected during his time running the chipmaker.\nThe US unveiled new restrictions on China\u2019s access to vital components for chips and AI, escalating a campaign to contain Beijing\u2019s technological ambitions but stopping short of earlier proposals that would have sanctioned more key Chinese firms.\nNebius Group NV, the technology company rebranded from Russian internet giant Yandex, has raised $700 million from a slate of investors including Nvidia and Accel Partners LP.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nPostmarket\nSalesforce Inc.\nMarvell Technology\nPure Storage\nOkta\nDescartes Systems\nBox\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it\u2019s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI\u2019s Alexander Wang to Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei to Databricks\u2019 Ali Ghodsi weighing in.\u201d\nJensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said:\n\u201cA foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it\u2019s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we\u2019re learning, however, is that it\u2019s not enough that we\u2019ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.\u201d\nRead\u00a0Huang\u2019s comments in detail here.\nBosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said:\n\u201c\u2026..also acknowledge that this alone isn\u2019t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks currently trending on the back of latest analyst ratings and news.

(NASDAQ:AMD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 107\nThe Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)-powered El Capitan claimed the top spot in the 64th edition of the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers.\n\u201cThe new El Capitan system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, U.S.A., has debuted as the most powerful system on the list with an HPL score of 1.742 EFlop/s,\u201d according to TOP500. \u201cIt has 11,039,616 combined CPU and GPU cores and is based on AMD 4th generation EPYC processors with 24 cores at 1.8GHz and AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators.\u201d\nThe system uses HPE\u2019s (NYSE:HPE) Cray Slingshot 11 network for data transfer and achieves an energy efficiency of 58.89 Gigaflops/watt.\n\u201cAMD GPU cores overtook NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) for the first time, boosted by El Capitan which accounted for ~37% of AMD\u2019s total accelerator cores on the list,\u201d said Wells Fargo analysts, led by Aaron Rakers, in a note on the rankings. \u201cAMD\u2019s share of CPU cores hit an all-time high at 29% and systems, while NVIDIA GPUs grew to 184 (ex-China) versus 166 a year ago.\u201d\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0bulls believe the market should stop comparing the company\u2019s chips with Nvidia and focus on its data-center growth and its competitive edge over other players like Intel. Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s strong growth in the data center segment is indeed impressive, driven by Instinct GPU shipments and strong sales of EPYC CPUs.\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0will continue to benefit from organic growth catalysts in this segment despite the competition from Nvidia. According to Goldman Sachs Research, global data center demand could surge by 160% by 2030. In the U.S., data centers are projected to use 8% of total power by 2030, up from 3% in 2022. McKinsey estimates that adding the required U.S. capacity will need over $500 billion in infrastructure investment by the decade\u2019s end.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s forward adjusted PEG ratio is about 40% lower than the median for the tech sector (XLK).\nColumbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cShares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) lagged the market after the company reported earnings results that, while generally strong, left the market wanting more. The company reported AI revenue of ~$600 million and increased its forward-looking outlook for AI revenue growth, but shares took a breather, as results missed elevated expectations after the stock\u2019s strong performance. Despite the stock\u2019s underperformance during the quarter, the company\u2019s AI story remains very much intact. The growth outlook for the company is supported by better cloud demand, enterprise recovery and continued share gains ahead of the company\u2019s new AI product launch.\u201d\nOverall, AMD ranks 7th on our list of top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days.\nThe debate around AI systems hitting a \u201cdata wall\u201d or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry.\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said:\n\u201cAll it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it\u2019s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI\u2019s Alexander Wang to Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei to Databricks\u2019 Ali Ghodsi weighing in.\u201d\nJensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said:\n\u201cA foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it\u2019s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we\u2019re learning, however, is that it\u2019s not enough that we\u2019ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.\u201d\nRead\u00a0Huang\u2019s comments in detail here.\nBosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said:\n\u201c\u2026..also acknowledge that this alone isn\u2019t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks currently trending on the back of latest analyst ratings and news. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

One, OpenAI is reportedly mulling developing a search engine to compete with Google. Two, DoJ plans to seek divestiture of Google Chrome, which is perhaps the crown jewel of Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s search business.\nChrome is just a browser. It does not bring any revenue on its own. So why is it so important? Chrome drives Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s revenue by sending traffic to its default search engine, which generates income through ads. In Q3 2024, Google Search brought in $49.4B, making up 56% of the company\u2019s total revenue for the quarter. Chrome also helps Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) gather browsing data, improve search relevance, and refine ad targeting, which attracts more advertisers willing to pay for prime ad space. It\u2019s crucial for maintaining Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s search dominance, holding around 89% of global search traffic and 50% of the US browser market. \u00a0Chrome also acts as a gateway to other Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) services like Gmail, YouTube, and Google accounts, boosting user engagement. Removing the seamless integration could hurt users.\nHowever, Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the stock is a buy on the current weakness and call the latest worries around Chrome an overreaction. They believe DoJ will use the Chrome divestiture threat as leverage to push Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0into agreeing to less severe actions, like ending exclusive contracts with device makers such as Apple and Samsung, or opening Chrome to third-party search engines, giving users more choice.\nColumbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) shares moved lower during the quarter, as the company was a victim of the rotation out of the technology sector and artificial intelligence-focused companies. In August, a federal judge ruled that Google had violated antitrust laws by engaging in unfair business tactics to dominate the Internet search advertising market. The central aspect of the government\u2019s case against Alphabet was that the company\u2019s $20 billion in annual payments to Apple made Google the default search engine on iPhones. Our team remains bullish on Alphabet\u2019s overall business model.\u201d\nOverall, GOOG ranks 4th on our list of top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

It is not an exaggeration to say that 2024 has been rough for markets given that crucial events like the commencement of an easing cycle followed by the US elections remained a major influence on the overall environment. Amid all these awaited events, the tech sector has not been an investor favorite, however, that may change sooner than we think.\nOn November 26, Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, joined\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his opinion on the stock market, particularly the tech sector. Krishna raised his S&P 500 price target for 2025 to 6,600 and shed light on why he believes such is possible.\nHe shared that the economy is pretty constructive from a macro perspective given that the virtuous cycle between income and employment remains solid. He added that consumer balances are going up and believes that the overall economic conditions of the country have been positive. All these reasons combined explain the price target of 6,600 for the S&P 500.\nSpeaking of the technology sector, Krishna agreed that the \u201cmarket is, on a consistent basis, underestimating the earnings power of tech, especially big tech.\u201d He added that at the same time, the market is also overestimating the earnings power of the other non-tech names in the S&P 500. He shared that the market expected Big Tech to post earnings up by 19% year-over-year and have \u201cflat revisions\u201d in the third quarter. Non-tech stocks on the other hand were marked down by 2%.\nHowever, Krishna revealed that as the earnings period of Q3 2024 comes to a close, Big Tech actually delivered 31% of earnings growth during the quarter. He added that non-tech stocks have moved in the same direction but only incrementally. He explained that, for example, non-tech stocks were originally marked down, but instead, they expanded by 2%, accelerating at a very slow pace.\nHe also emphasized that the rate at which the market expects Big Tech earnings to slow down is in reality much lower than the actual deceleration rate. Overall, Krishna expects the market to converge but highlighted that it may not be as close as we expect it to be, probably not sooner than Q1 2026.\nStory Continues\nWhile turmoil and uncertainty remain a key element in the market, some stocks are revolutionary enough that they are bound to offer great opportunities in the coming years, if not now. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best stocks to buy for long term growth.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the best stocks to buy for long term growth we sifted through multiple rankings on the internet.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days.\nThe debate around AI systems hitting a \u201cdata wall\u201d or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry.\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said:\n\u201cAll it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it\u2019s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI\u2019s Alexander Wang to Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei to Databricks\u2019 Ali Ghodsi weighing in.\u201d\nJensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said:\n\u201cA foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it\u2019s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we\u2019re learning, however, is that it\u2019s not enough that we\u2019ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.\u201d\nRead\u00a0Huang\u2019s comments in detail here.\nBosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said:\n\u201c\u2026..also acknowledge that this alone isn\u2019t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks currently trending on the back of latest analyst ratings and news. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAnalyst Points to \u2018Unique Opportunity\u2019 For Microsoft (MSFT) Search, Ads Business Amid Google Lawsuit\nmanaemedia / Shutterstock.com\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nBarclays recently highlighted what Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) could gain in the search market in certain scenarios of the outcome of the DoJ\u2019s case against Google.\n\u201cWith Bing being a small part of the Microsoft top-line (5% of total revenue in FY24), the ramifications of any developments here seem to have been largely ignored based on our investor discussions, particularly with many software investors not having the context of the ongoing trial,\u201d analyst Raimo Lenschow wrote in a note to clients. \u201cHowever, following the Department of Justice\u2019s long-awaited Proposed Final Judgment, we think that Microsoft investors should pay closer attention to any final rulings that come from the case.\u201d\nLenschow, who has an Overweight rating and a $475 price target on Microsoft\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), noted that if the remedies include ending revenue-sharing agreements between Google and other parties, or if Google starts syndicating its search offering, Bing could gain market share. This might force Google to make some of its technology stack available to partners and offer search text ads for one year to U.S. partners while keeping just 10% of gross revenue.\n\u201cIn tandem with this, Google is only allowed to syndicate 25% of search text ads, meaning that partners (like an Apple) would need to backfill their remaining search ads either through their own tech stack or through a new partner like Bing,\u201d Lenschow added. \u201cThis, in theory, would open up a unique opportunity for Microsoft to capture share for a period of time.\u201d\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after Microsoft reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue growth in its Azure cloud segment. Additionally, management\u2019s fiscal first[1]quarter 2025 Azure revenue guidance came in slightly below estimates. Despite this shortfall, management highlighted that AI contributed 7% to cloud growth, up from 6% last quarter and 3% a year ago. We continue to believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain a leadership role in AI, given its innovative approach and significant growth potential.\u201d\nOverall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks.\nAs 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. They beckon 2025 with a rather historic run on the stock market that has seen several high-growth technology stocks flourish despite the fact that until September, interest rates in the US were at a two-decade high level.\nDriving the bullishness behind technology stocks is artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that relies on high-end GPUs to run advanced mathematical techniques and infer new conclusions from existing data sets has been the focus of Wall Street and big technology companies. So far, most of the AI-related stock gains have been limited to the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite graphics processing unit (GPU) company whose stock is up by more than\u00a0700%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nHowever, the gains have to broaden out to other stocks for the AI wave to continue. This broadening is dependent on the use of AI increasing among businesses and consumers. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo has some insights to share. In its report titled \u2018Generative AI \u2014 Potential pitfalls, challenges, and risks the bank outlines that while AI \u201chas the potential to be broadly transformative,\u201d there are several \u201coutstanding questions and concerns that need to be addressed before it is widely accepted on a larger scale.\u201d Quoting its \u2018The AI Index 2024 Annual Report,\u2019 the bank points out that from 2012 to 2023, the number of AI incidents has jumped more than tenfold from sitting at roughly 10 to ~122. These incidents cover the ethical misuse of AI such as the wrong detection of criminals stemming from facial recognition systems.\nWF\u00a0points\u00a0out that while these incidents are concerning, other factors will also determine AI\u2019s wider acceptability and use. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints. The bank adds that these factors are also accompanied by the potentially transformative effect of AI on the labor market. Starting from its beliefs about the labor market, WF believes that generative AI, which is different from other AI systems such as machine learning, will have a more \u201cnuanced\u201d impact on the labor market compared to traditional AI. Commenting on common worries of AI taking jobs away, the bank outlines that the jobs that AI will replace will in turn be replaced by new jobs created by AI. To quote WF, it believes \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s disruptive effect on the labor market to mirror other forms of automation \u2014 as in the past, its impact likely will be mitigated over time by new occupations spawned by the innovations themselves.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTo help bolster its claim, WF shares data from MIT. It points out that MIT\u2019s estimates show that \u201c60% of U.S. workers are now employed in occupations that did not exist 84 years ago.\u201d As for which job functions might give way to AI, these include knowledge-based roles such as those found in financial services and support roles such as those performed by customer support agents.\nTwo additional key disruptive AI effects that Wall Street in particular is keenly aware of are its rising costs and the effect on the utility industry. The S&P\u2019s utility sector is up by 28.36% year-to-date which leads the broader index\u2019s 26.48% in gains by nearly two percentage points. Commenting on this, the bank believes that \u201cthere will be a significant increase in hardware demand, notably within the data-center environment, to accommodate the substantial increase in AI workloads,\u201d adding that \u201cit may take a number of years to increase the operational efficiency of various large language models and decrease costs to a level more in-line with existing search engines.\u201d WF also shares that while existing opportunities to expand data center footprint to accommodate AI are present, as they \u201cdiminish, companies may revisit existing data-center locations to retrofit and upgrade hardware and infrastructure in support of the power and data-consumption needs of new AI technologies.\u201d\nGiven the criticality of the data center space to AI, WF expands on this sector in another\u00a0report. Titled \u2018Generative AI transforming data center landscape\u201d it comments on the capital expenditure required to set up data centers, future trends for data centers, and the stock market sectors that might benefit from growing interest and focus on the data center industry. According to its analysis, investor attention is mostly focused on AI-related investments in semiconductors and cloud computing.\nHowever, other sectors, such as \u201ccabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators\u201d are also important. WF quotes a utility company to explain why these tertiary sectors are critical in the AI wave. It shares that utility company believes that \u201cthe server rack power density required to train a generative-AI-based large language model can require up to five to seven times more power than server racks used for traditional IT workloads in a data center.\u201d\nWhile semiconductor companies are natural beneficiaries of the AI boom, some oft-ignored sectors that WF mentions are industrials and materials. It outlines that when it comes to building massive data centers, estimates suggest \u201cthat approximately 35% \u2013 45% of the cost is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out. These areas are addressable by companies who supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors).\u201d Additionally, \u201c40% \u2013 45% and 15% \u2013 20% of the remaining cost can be attributed to electrical and HVAC systems respectively,\u201d according to Wells Fargo. AI is having an effect on materials, as per the bank, in the form of \u201cincreased demand for materials that are used in the production of semiconductor chips, water handling and recycling within data centers, and steel and construction materials to build data centers.\u201d\nFor some materials stocks and a primer on how they are reliant on the broader economic activity, you can check out\u00a010 Best Materials Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s top AI & non-AI stocks that can outpace the flagship S&P, we selected technology-focused stocks from the bank\u2019s recent Focus List and ranked them by their consensus next twelve-month EPS estimates.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) have to ensure that it keeps its dominant position in the industry, but the firm also has to be on the watch-out for regulatory actions against its business. It is also one of the biggest players in the cloud computing industry and has leveraged its resources to develop a foundational AI model called Gemini and custom AI chips called TPUs. Both of these could unlock additional tailwinds for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the AI era.\nA mega-cap firm, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is taking a global approach to AI. Here\u2019s what CEO Sundar Pichai shared during the\u00a0Q3 2024 earnings call:\n\u201cAnd third, a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world, creating a virtuous cycle. Let me quickly touch on each of these. We continue to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure to support our AI efforts from the U.S. to Thailand to Uruguay.

AWS is the world\u2019s largest cloud services provider, ahead of second-place Microsoft (MSFT) and third-place Google (GOOG, GOOGL). And anything that improves the cloud business\u2019s availability and performance has the potential to draw more customers while ensuring existing users don\u2019t flee to Amazon\u2019s rivals.\nAmazon says the latest updates include simplified electrical and mechanical designs for its data centers that ensure better than 99% infrastructure availability. In other words, the company streamlined its hardware to ensure its data centers stay up and running without any hiccups.\nThe tech giant says it\u2019s also preparing for Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) upcoming Blackwell chips by outfitting its data centers with liquid cooling capabilities. Data centers generally use air-cooled servers that dissipate heat their chips and servers generate using fans. But according to Kalyanaraman, servers running Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chips or Amazon\u2019s own Trainium 2 chips run so hot that the only way to cool them is using a liquid cooling system.\nAttendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent 2021. (Noah Berger/Amazon Web Services via AP Images) \u00b7 Amazon Web Services\nYou can think of a liquid cooling system as akin to the radiator system in a car. Generally, coolant circulates through a series of pipes to a block attached to a server chip. The heat generated by the chip transfers to the block and then the coolant, which then passes through a radiator where it\u2019s cooled and recirculated to the chip.\nHeat is a massive problem for computer components. If a system gets too hot, it\u2019ll either slow down or shut off completely to prevent serious damage. So keeping new AI servers cool is paramount for cloud computing companies.\nStory Continues\n\u201cWe have \u2026 over a hundred thousand customers running generative AI applications all the way from training to inference to fine-tuning across services like SageMaker and Bedrock, as well as our infrastructure services,\u201d Kalyanaraman explained. \u201cAnd so these innovations allow these customers to run a lot more compute on AWS. It allows us to actually run that efficiently for customers and run those services in a highly available way as well.\u201d\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nAmazon says it\u2019s also improving overall electrical efficiency for its data centers, which means the company will be able to squeeze more performance out of the same amount of power it\u2019s been using.\n\u201cOur mechanical efficiency with these enhancements improves by 46%, which means you have more power that's actually available for compute,\u201d Kalyanaraman said.\nThe proliferation of generative AI technologies means that data center companies are using a lot more power. That has led firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, among others, to look at ways to improve data center efficiency and new power sources, including nuclear energy.\nThe generative AI hype cycle is still relatively new, and cloud providers are set to continue building out ever more powerful data centers. But doing so will mean having to rethink how they construct and operate these enormous facilities. Amazon\u2019s moves are just the latest example of that reality.

We delivered a strong Q1 with all metrics, once again, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Revenue grew 26% year over year, and bookings growth accelerated to over 30% driven by increasing customer commitments to our zero trust exchange platform and growing interest in our AI solutions.\nOur billings growth of 13% far exceeded the recent average growth rate of publicly traded legacy network security vendors by over 10 percentage points, demonstrating our continued market share gains in cybersecurity. We are making tremendous progress, executing on our go-to-market plans and driving innovations that our customers are relying on us for. With continued strong demand, I'm very pleased to increase our full-year billings and revenue guidance.\nQ1 was a solid quarter for profitability as well. With our operating discipline, we grew operating profit by 50% year over year and delivered new Q1 records for operating margin of 21%, and free cash flow margin of 46%. While many successful SaaS companies strive for Rule of 40 results, our revenue growth and free cash flow margin makes us a rare SaaS company that operates at Rule of 70 or better. This places us in the top handful of the 145 largest public SaaS companies.\nIn my scores of customer conversations. CXOs are prioritizing zero trust security and AI for their IT spending. We are fighting AI with AI. We recently delivered several AI innovations and are continuing to expand our AI portfolio in the following three areas of high customer interest. First, securing use of AI applications for faster and safer adoption of public and private AI applications. We enable customers to securely adopt public AI apps such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and GitHub Copilot with Zscaler for copilots.\nZscaler for copilots provides granular visibility to find and classify on-prem or cloud data, gives access control for only the right users to access data, limits copilots' discovery of data, fixes copilot misconfigurations, and enforces policies to stop sensitive data from leaking. Our industry-leading capabilities in this area are driving large customer wins.\nFor example, in a new logo win, a Global 2000 technology services customer purchased our AI-powered data protection solution, which accounted for 50% of the seven-figure ACV deal. Data protection enabled this customer to securely roll out Microsoft Copilot. The secure use of Office 365 was a huge opportunity for us, and I believe the secure use of Microsoft Copilot is a huge opportunity as well.\nIn addition to enabling secure adoption of copilots, we provide visibility and control into public AI apps used by employees, scores the risk level of AI apps, and store prompt queries for logging or auditing purposes. With the widespread adoption of public AI apps, we are seeing growing demand for their security.\nOur innovations are expanding beyond securing public AI apps to customers' private AI apps, including chatbots, LLM, and SLM models and influence engines. We're expanding the functionality of our inline proxy-based zero trust exchange with an LLM proxy to analyze prompt queries and results, to detect and prevent prompt injections and other malicious activities.\nSecond, AI-powered automated digital experience for operational efficiency and faster resolution of end-to-end user performance issues. Our already available automated digital experience products including ZDX Copilot are contributing to large deal wins. For example, in a seven-figure ACV upsell deal, a large healthcare provider doubled their ZIA subscription to 60,000 seats and purchased ZDX Advanced Plus, which includes ZDX Copilot for all 60,000 seats.\nThis customer plans to use ZDX Copilot to automate IT operations and reduce resolution time for service tickets. With this deal, this customer's annual spend more than doubled with us. We're taking ZDX Copilot to the next level with ZDX AI agent to automate root cause analysis, resulting in a further reduction in resolution time and provide automated recommendations to fix user performance issues.\nThird, AI-powered security products are better cyber and data protection and SecOps automation. We have delivered several AI-powered innovations for data and cyber protection such as automated data classification, GenAI-based image classification, zero-day vulnerability detection and prevention, AI-powered app segmentation, and ML-based IoT/OT device discovery.\nFor increased productivity and efficiency of security operations, we have introduced several innovations including Risk360 and unified vulnerability management by extending our zero trust platform with data fabric technology. We are developing other AI power innovations including breach prediction, threat hunting, and more.\nOur AI-powered solutions leverage a vast amount of proprietary enterprise data generated by 500 billion transactions per day, processed by our zero trust exchange. We will continue to leverage our data and combine it with new agent-based technologies to rapidly expand our AI portfolio. The combination of zero trust and AI is creating exciting new opportunities, which we are well positioned to capture with our large and expanding platform.\nMoving on, hackers are finding new ways to exploit the limitations of legacy castle-and-moat security to launch an increasing number of sophisticated attacks. Such attacks often start with exploitation of firewall or VPN architecture. These traditional security solutions enable threat actors to move laterally on the corporate network and compromise the entire organization. To make up for the flawed architecture, legacy security vendors are offering disjointed point products under the pretext of a platform. This increases cost and complexity for customers.\nA Fortune 50 retail customer recently told me that a legacy final vendor sold them a so-called platform. And when they tried to implement it, they found that it was nothing more than consolidated billings. Complexity is the enemy of security and resilience. No wonder so many enterprises are getting breached despite spending billions of dollars on so-called SASE security, which is nothing more than virtual firewalls and VPNs in the cloud.\nThe sooner organizations move away from these disjointed security solutions to zero trust, the sooner they will become secure and resilient. Zscaler customers, modernized, and future-proof the security with our platform for better security, operational simplicity, and cost reduction. Today, we proudly secured over 35% of Global 2000 and about 45% of the Fortune 500, and we're seeing more and more large enterprises adopt our platform.\nTo give you an example, in a new logo seven-figure ACV deal, a Global 2000 aerospace and defense company purchased ZIA for 100,000 users and workload protection for 5,000 workloads. This customer initiated a strategic shift towards the cloud-first architecture and chose Zscaler as their partner for their security transformation.\nAdditionally, we see significant opportunity for ZPA upsells. Let me share an example. An existing Fortune 500 insurance customer expanded the ZIA subscription from 45,000 to 70,000 users and purchased ZPA for all 70,000 users.\nIn addition to securing access to private applications, rapid M&A integration for faster time to value realization was a key objective for this customer. ZPA expedites M&A integration by securely providing zero trust access to applications for the acquired entity's employees without having to connect the networks of two companies. This is not possible with a firewall-based SASE solution. With this upsell, This. customer's annual spend with us almost doubled to over $5 million. We expect ZPA to continue to be one of our biggest growth drivers in fiscal '25.\nMoving on to data protection, at Zenith Live, we outline our broader vision of our data protection solution, where our customers are increasingly adopting. For example, in a seven-figure ACV deal, a Fortune 500 pharma company purchased our data protection solution for over 23,000 users to eliminate multiple-point products including legacy data loss prevention, insider threat management, email data security and more. This purchase is nearly doubled the annual spend of this customer with Zscaler.\nI'm thrilled with the innovations we are bringing to our data protection solution. For example, we recently introduced a unique offering, which combines the capabilities of ZPA with our cloud browser product to bring zero trust access to third-party suppliers and partners.\nTraditionally, third-party application access was addressed either by VDIs that are expensive and complex or by third-party enterprise browsers that require yet another agent to be deployed on the endpoint. Third-party enterprise browsers are complex to deploy and manage and their vulnerabilities are being exploited by attackers.\nOur solution uses standard browsers like Chrome and provides superior security while eliminating VDIs and third-party browsers. To give you a few examples, a Global 2000 IT services company for 20,000 users; a US-based shipping and packaging company for 7,000 users; a Global 2000 insurance company for over 5,000 users, each purchased our cloud browser solution to eliminate legacy third-party access products. We will continue to invest to accelerate innovations in this area.\nNext, our emerging products including ZDX, zero trust for branch and cloud, and AI analytics are increasingly contributing to our success. I'm excited to share that emerging products ARR is growing twice as fast as our cold products. Combined with our account-centric go-to-market motion, our emerging products are driving large seven-figure deals.\nLet me share two examples. First, in a seven-figure upsell deal, a Fortune 500 transportation customer purchased ZIA for workloads eliminating virtual firewalls from the cloud environments. This upsell drove approximately 40% increase in the annual spend of this existing $5 million-plus ARR customer. Driven by our continued innovations for workload protection and our account-centric go-to-market strategy, we are securing large workload footprints for increasing number of customers, which has accelerated workload protection ARR over the past couple of quarters.\nSecond, in a new logo seven-figure ACV win, a large US automotive supplier purchased our zero trust SD-WAN for all 45 of their branches and zero trust devices segmentation for their 37 factories. A combination of zero trust SD-WAN with zero trust device segmentation will eliminate lateral threat movement among branches and factories, which is not possible to achieve with traditional SD-WAN. I believe with our solutions, we will accelerate the decline of North-South and East-West firewalls. This deal is an example of a global system integrator or GSI working closely with Zscaler to transform customers' legacy networks and security to zero trust architecture.\nNext, in the federal vertical, we added a new cabinet-level agency this quarter, and now we proudly serve 14 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies, including the DoD. Federal agencies are adopting the Zscaler platform to improve their security posture and reduce cost and complexity by eliminating firewalls and VPNs. Having landed these cabinet-level agencies, we see significant upsell opportunities to grow ARR over time.\nWe are also continuing expansion into other federal agencies. For example, in a new logo win, a large federal agency purchased ZPA and ZDX for 22,000 users in a seven-figure ACV deal. Government investigations by multiple countries including Australia, the European Union, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States concluded that nation state fiber attackers are successfully breaching the moat created by firewall-based solutions, and as a result, these governments are planning to adopt zero trust architecture. We see this as a huge opportunity, and we will leverage our success in US federal to grow our business in these and other countries.\nNext, let me share a few highlights of the progress we're making to up-level our go-to-market engine. I am pleased to share that we're making solid progress on hiring and attrition plans. We had a strong quarter of hiring highly experienced, quota-carrying account executives and had lower attrition. We expect these trends to continue in Q2, strengthening our sales capacity heading into the second half of fiscal '25.\nLast year, we made the strategic decision to shift our sales motion from opportunity-based selling to account-centric selling. Our CRO, Mike Rich, and his team are executing on this strategy, and we're already seeing stronger customer engagement, higher-quality pipeline, better close rates, and more business with customers. Strong customer engagement and sales execution contributed to over 20% year-over-year growth in unscheduled billings in Q1. As a reminder, unscheduled billings is comprised of new upsell and renewal billings.\nWe also grew $1 million-plus ARR customers by 25% year over year to 585. We ended Q1 with over 65 customers spending $5 million-plus annually with us.\nMoving on to the channel, we are working closely with our strategic partners including GSIs, strategic national and regional partners, and hyperscalers to drive faster value realization for customers, and increasing number of strategic partners are embedding Zscaler's platform in their solutions for their customers. Our joint partner offerings are expanding beyond ZIA, ZPA, and ZDX to now include our emerging products.\nOverall with strong execution in our account-centric sales motion, we expect to continue to grow the number of $1 million-plus and $5 million-plus customers at a strong pace. With a more mature pipeline, a stronger sales team, and growing partner engagements, I believe we remain on track to increase sales productivity and achieve strong growth.\nIn conclusion, our expanding portfolio that combines the power of zero trust and AI is resonating with customers. Our customer engagements are getting stronger as demonstrated by our net promoter score or NPS of over 70, which is well over 2x the SaaS company average. I'm proud of the progress we made in our go to market initiatives this quarter, and we will continue to make further progress towards achieving our next goal of $5 billion in ARR.\nNow I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa\nThank you, Jay. Our Q1 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $628 million, up 26% year over year and up 6% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 54% of revenue; EMEA was 30%; and APJ was 16%.\nOur total calculated billings in Q1 grew 13% year over year to $517 million. As Jay mentioned, our unscheduled billings comprised of new upsell and renewal billings grew over 20% year over year. Our calculated current billings grew 12% year over year.\nOur remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 26% from a year ago to $4.411 billion. Current RPO was approximately 49% of the total RPO.\nWe ended Q1 with 585 customers with over $1 million in ARR and 3,165 customers with over $100,000 in ARR. This continued strong growth of large customers speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation journeys.\nOur 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 114%. While good for our business, our increased success in selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start, and faster up sales within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. There could be variability in this metric on a quarterly basis due to the factors I just mentioned.\nTurning to the rest of our Q1 financial performance, total gross margin of 80.6% compares to 80.7% in the year-ago quarter. Our total operating expenses increased 5% sequentially and 19% year over year to $372 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model with operating margin of approximately 21%, an increase of about 330 basis points year over year.\nOur free cash flow margin was 46%, including data center CapEx of approximately 3% of revenue. We ended the quarter with over $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.\nNow let me provide our guidance for Q2 and full-year fiscal 2025. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $633 million to $635 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 21%, gross margins of approximately 80%.\nI would like to remind investors that we are introducing new products that are experiencing strong growth and are optimized for faster go-to-market rather than margins. This will continue to influence our gross margins. We plan to optimize new products for margins over time as they scale.\nOperating profit in the range of $126 million to $128 million. Net other income of $18 million. Earnings per share in the range of $0.68 to $0.69, assuming a 23% tax rate and 163 million fully diluted shares.\nFor the full-year fiscal 2025, we expect billings in the range of $3.124 billion to $3.149 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 19% to 20%. We expect our first-half mix to be approximately 39.3% to 39.5% of our full-year billings guide.\nRevenue in the range of $2.623 billion to $2.643 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 21% to 22%. Operating profit in the range of $549 million to $559 million. Earnings per share in the range of $2.94 to $2.99, assuming a 23% tax rate and approximately 164 million fully diluted shares.\nWe expect our free cash flow margin to be approximately 23.5% to 24%. We expect our data center CapEx to be approximately 3 points higher as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 2024 as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we'll invest aggressively to position us for long-term growth and profitability.\nOn a personal note, I'd like to share that after eight amazing years, I have decided to retire as Chief Financial Officer of Zscaler. It has been my greatest pleasure to be a part of Zscaler's journey from less than $250 million to over $2.5 billion in ARR. I'd like to thank Jay for his confidence in me. It has been a true partnership which for me personally has been very special.\nI'd also like to thank the employees of Zscaler and our Board of Directors for their support through the years and also thank our customers, partners, investors, and analysts. I am confident that Zscaler will continue to shape the next several decades of cybersecurity with its zero trust exchange platform. I look forward to following Zscaler's progress.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jake.\nJay Chaudhry\nI want to personally thank Remo for all his contributions to Zscaler. Remo has been a friend and a trusted business partner whose wisdom and judgment helped us make many critical decisions as we scaled our business at an unprecedented pace. He will be dearly missed. Remo will remain as CFO until his successor is appointed.\nWith that, operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. And at this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nSaket Kalia, Barclays.\nSaket Kalia\nOkay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. And first off, Remo, congrats on your retirement. Heck of a run at Zscaler and all the companies before this as well.\nRemo Canessa\nThank you, Saket. I appreciate that.\nSaket Kalia\nAbsolutely. Jay, maybe for you. Thanks for the detail on the unscheduled billings growth of 20% this quarter. Can you just maybe talk about how that did versus your expectation or maybe versus last quarter for some context? And as you look forward, do you still feel confident in sort of the accelerated billings growth as that contracted non-cancelable billings pool grows and normalizes back to what it was historically?\nRemo Canessa\nSo I'll start. The 20% growth is what we expected and actually exceed our expectations also. As we talked about, the scheduled contracted billings is 7% in the first half and 23% in the second half. So we do expect the unscheduled billings to be 20%-plus also in the second half as we talked about on the last call.\nJay Chaudhry\nGood. And in addition to that, let me add a few comments. Our Q1 was very strong. There are three factors that I believe will keep on helping us the second half. One, we are seeing strong demand in the Zscaler platform, including solid signs of interest for AI security offerings we have that wasn't there before.\nTwo, we have a strong and growing pipeline. Three, our ramp sales capacity has strengthened, and we have lower sales attritions in Q1. So I feel very good about our guidance for the second half.\nOperator\nAndrew Nowinski, Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski\nThanks. Remo, sorry to hear you're retiring. It's certainly been a pleasure working with you over the last decade.\nI guess I'd like to ask you a question the data security. The ZDX Copilot certainly sounds like an interesting opportunity. Given your prior partnership with Microsoft and your ability to securely deliver traffic to Office 365, I would imagine Microsoft is supporting you in this endeavor. But just wondering maybe if you could provide some more color on how you're helping -- how they're helping you bring more customers, help more customers roll out Copilot, and whether you are seeing Zscaler beat Varonis in that space.\nJay Chaudhry\nThank you. Sure. It's a good question. Yeah. What we're building is essentially leveraging a lot of work we did with Microsoft over the years. We've done tons of integration, including integration with data discovery and classification, whether it's talking with OneDrive or SharePoint and others.\nWhat gives us unique advantage is that we are sitting in line for all the traffic for Office 365. We can also go what's known as outer band using API for some of the classification discovery and the like. But this is as big of an opportunity for us as it was actually for Office 365, maybe bigger in some ways.\nWe are here. The customers have already embraced Office 365. Customers are actually beginning to use Microsoft Copilot, and now they're concerned about their data and privacy as well. We're seeing real deals.\nI briefly mentioned during our earnings lease, a G2000 company, they wanted to secure Microsoft Copilot. So they did deal with us. This was a seven-figure deal, and it is really driven by our data protection solution that's AI-powered, which identifies and make sure only the right amount of data can be accessed by the right user when they're using Microsoft Copilot.\nSo while many companies out there will try to do AI security but not very many of them are sitting in the traffic path, they may be able to do one piece of it, but we can do both inline as well as data sitting [at us]. So I'm very excited for the opportunity, and you'll see more coming with us. We are already working with the field with many of the Microsoft organizations to make sure we help our customers as -- customers of the same common interest.\nOperator\nGabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges\nHi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Jay, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on ZPA being a particularly meaningful driver, of course, in FY25. Maybe just remind us, how far along do you think we are in the VPN replacement cycle? How is the competitive environment changing? And what are some of the catalysts that might call an enterprise to reevaluate their VPN and zero trust ZPA strategy now versus maybe, call it, during COVID? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry\nYeah, I thought VPNs will be gone a long time ago -- there are lots and lots of them sitting out there -- similar to we used to wonder how long will Blue Coat proxies be here. We're still discovering lots of them and replacing them. But the opportunity is not just VPN. VPN is the starting point. That's a kind of beach head for us.\nWe are the entire inbound [DMC] that replaces the whole stack starting with load balancers, DDoS protection, external firewalls, VPN, all that kind of stuff. So that's a big opportunity. And the next phase of this opportunity ends up being zero trust segmentation out there -- so the three-phase VPN replacement, entire inbound DMC, and segmentation with zero trust.\nIf you look at what we've done with ZPA in terms of our numbers, it's a remarkable growth. At the time of the IPO, ZPA was about a single-digit percent of new and upsell business. Today, ZPA is over 40% of the mix of new and upsell, generated by ZIA and ZPA combined. I believe it's a matter of time when all of our customers will buy ZIA, ZPA, and ZDX for every employee. That's where our customers are headed.\nWe see more and more wins out there. And the so-called competition is still trying to spin up virtual VPN in the cloud and garner zero trust. So we think we have a big advantage in this area for quite some time.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat, thanks so much. So much information you've shared. Remo, fantastic run. Congrats. And nice strong booking start to the year, guys.\nJay, I was surprised to hear you compared your growth this quarter to that of the firewall players out there just given how differentiated you are. And some of those folks are talking about significant hardware refresh opportunities ahead as they have boxes that go end of life. If you look backwards, to what extent are those events, opportunities for Zscaler to go in and totally re-architect and transform and displace a set of branch firewalls, for example, and bring them onto your platform? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry\nYes. I agree with your statement. I was wondering should we be ever talk about comparing our billings growth to firewalls. Sure, but the delta was so big that we thought it's worth highlighting it.\nBut moving on to the other question you had about the fresh next year. When people used to ask me three years ago, are you replacing firewalls directly?, and I would say, no, we're not focused in firewalls -- but where we are sitting today, firewall refresh is a good opportunity for us. And we're planning to target customers with our cost takeout programs.\nTill about a year ago, we had limited impact on firewalls. But now, with a combination of our zero trust SD-WAN and zero trust device segmentation, we're able to replace most of the firewalls, North-South firewalls, East-West firewalls, in data center, in branches, as well -- in the cloud as well.\nSo I'm seeing tremendous customer interest to reduce or eliminate firewalls with our platform. So it's a good opportunity that we pursue.\nBrad Zelnick\nThank you. If I could just sneak in a quick follow-up, I don't know for you or Remo, but 30%-plus bookings growth, that is really strong. I think by my math, current bookings using cRPO even is strong as well. So it's not as if this is driven by duration.\nCan you maybe unpack for us just to help us to understand -- I understand the scheduled versus unscheduled billings dynamic, but we're looking at a pretty significant delta, and I just -- I feel like that bookings number is so strong it's worth highlighting and maybe just drilling into a bit for everyone. Thank you so much again.\nRemo Canessa\nYeah. It's a great number, Brad. 30% bookings growth, we're really proud of that. One thing to call out is that our unscheduled billings of 20%-plus growth basically both in the first half and second half, is helping that. But 30% bookings growth is, again, a really good number.\ncRPO -- strong growth in cRPO at 22%. RPO growth year over year at 26%. So all good metrics. And again, we're well-positioned with our customers. Our new and upsell is 65%, with upsell in Q1. Again, selling into accounts with the new go-to-market organization is taking hold. A lot of good things really happening for Zscaler are going into the second half -- into Q2 and also the second half of this year.\nOperator\nMike Cikos, Needham.\nMike Cikos\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. And I just really wanted to come back to the 20%-plus year-to-year unscheduled billings in the quarter. So congrats on that.\nI just wanted to see, can you tie that into the disclosure that we have today on that emerging products ARR? Is most of that unscheduled billings growth being sustained by those emerging products to see or hear that that ARR base is growing twice as fast as core, wanted to get some more color around if that's the driver and which products would that emerging products classes is seeing the most traction. Anything that would be incremental. Thank you very much, guys.\nRemo Canessa\nYeah, it's -- Mike, it's across the board. It's both emerging products as well as our core products. The emerging products include AI, workload protection, ZDX, and our brand solutions. ZDX is doing very well. But as we called out, also workloads is doing well for us.\nGoing forward, we made the comments that we'd be in the mid-20s percentage of new and upsell for the emerging products, and we still feel that. But to answer your question, it's across the board, our entire platform.\nJay Chaudhry\nYeah, maybe I can add a couple more comments about it. Yeah, the ARR -- emerging products ARR growing at 2x for core products; we're very excited about it.\nSo what's driving it? The branch is one part of it. I highlighted some of the deals for the branch. We talked about a seven-figure ACV deal for the branch for this automotive suppliers. We had zero trust SD-WAN securing 45 branches. We have Airgap doing zero trust segmentation of devices for 37 branches.\nSo that thing is taking all -- we believe, this is going to disrupt the SD-WAN, which enables lateral threat movement [transfer] attacks.\nI was especially pleased with the progress we're making on cloud workload protection. We have been selling workload protection. We did a great seven-figure deal in workload that is very interesting because a lot of these customers in the past have started small with us early on in smaller footprints.\nNow they're expanding those footprints with bigger deals, and that's what's going to accelerate our opportunity here. And then, there'll be zero trust workload segmentation the next opportunity. That's why we are excited because the only competition in the workload space for us for communication is old-school firewalls, and we're excited.\nOperator\nIttai Kidron, Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron\nThanks. And Remo -- so congratulations, and enjoy retirement. You earned it.\nA couple small ones for me. First of all, if I may, Remo, your last earnings call, you gave an ARR number and an ARR target for the end of the fiscal year. I was wondering if you can give us an update on ARR here now and the target for year-end.\nAnd then, on the second thing, on the emerging products, can you remind us what are the two, three biggest pieces within the emerging products category? Number one. But number two, also, what percent of new business activity do they represent for you right here, right now? Just trying to get a better sense of the change in mix there contribution-wise. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa\nI'll start then let Jay finish up. So our ARR target for the end of the year is $3 billion. And so we are on track for that $3 billion. Net retention rate is 114%, which, again, we think is outstanding. As we talked about -- that net retention rate is influenced with customers buying more upfront, but because of the new emerging products and the strength of new emerging products, that has a positive effect to that.\nRelated to what makes up the large part of emerging products, I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry\nYeah. Let me expand upon that. You can put them in a few buckets. ZDX started out; it has done very well. It's the biggest piece of it. Zero trust branch started out the branch connector group with our zero trust appliance, zero trust SD-WAN. It's a great area for us. Zero trust for workloads in the cloud, I shared a couple of examples, good opportunities.\nAnd now, the AI products is becoming actually pretty good area for us as well. So we are excited. In the past, we had talked about a part of AI products called AI analytics. This solution bundle was up 90% year over year. It's coming from a small base, but we're very pleased with the traction of the various emerging products are taking.\nRemo Canessa\nIn the new business and upsell opportunity, as we called out, we expect it to be in the mid-20% range, up from, I believe it was 22% last year. So we do see emerging products increasing in strength as we go forward.\nOperator\nRob Owens, Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens\nYeah. Thanks for taking my question. And I guess while I have the opportunity I'll pick on Remo and something he said because -- Remo, in your prepared remarks, you talked about ongoing customer scrutiny on large deals. And I don't know if that's just a general economic comment or there's something else coloring your opinion.\nA lot of the script was around adding AI in some of these transformational solutions that you guys are rolling out. Just curious if there's something else that might be lending to longer sales cycles as deals are getting bigger or if that was just more of a general economic comment. Thanks.\nRemo Canessa\nYeah. Rob, it was just a general economic comment, which basically we haven't really seen any change for a while.\nJay Chaudhry\nYes. But that, in ways, helps us. We are seeing interest in cyber -- especially in cyber that can really reduce the chance of ransomware attacks and the like. So that's where zero trust comes in. And then, the CIO often will say, and that hasn't changed, I like just cyber method, but if you can reduce my cost and complexity, doubly motivated.\nSo we really have combined the need for zero trust, and now AI becomes a further catalyst with cost and complexity reduction, which is helping us because most companies can't do cost reduction. A legacy firewall vendor is not going to cannibalize that large installed base of firewalls; we can.\nOperator\nBrian Essex, JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Remo, congratulations. We're certainly going to miss working with you.\nMaybe I wanted to hit on the SecOps side of the equation. Maybe, Jay, can you help us understand where we are in terms of progress with Avalor? And I noticed in the press release, you noted that you surpassed 0.5 trillion daily transactions, which is huge. How are your customers evaluating your ability to scale over the volume of data and traffic that you have, given all the changes we're seeing in the SecOps side of the market in the current environment? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry\nSecOps market is ready for disruption. It's a big market. We had taken a very thoughtful approach of starting by building the data fabric so that all queries and all the stuff doesn't need to come to the massive data lake, which can take forever. So Avalor acquisition has done that for us.\nNow building upon Avalor, we had done a few things already that are in the market. We started with Risk360 that's powered by the back-end to Avalor. We have unified vulnerability management that actually helps customers make sure they can properly prioritize vulnerabilities in that space. And then, running on the same platform, some of the digital experience offerings are getting bigger and better as well.\nIn the SecOps, the biggest thing we're doing that others can easily do is essentially scoring and prioritization of what needs to be done. But the next phase that will be powered will be the products we're building that's called breach prediction and threat hunting. There they're working with some of the early-stage design, and customers are seeing some very good results.\nSo what the point we want to make was you can go and build technology. But if you don't have the kind of private enterprise data you need, you can't do much with it. Let me contrast it. ChatGPT took the public data off the whole world, trained it on LLMs. They're able to do it well, but the logs are private.\nZscaler, having those logs available, we can actually train the staff by apply -- but based on the collected learning, this thing can be applied to a specific customer so each customer gets benefit. So we are increasing our investment in this area. And over time, you're going to start seeing some more meaningful results in this area.\nOperator\nJoel Fishbin, Truist.\nJoel Fishbein\nThanks for taking the question. Remo, big shoes to fill, and you'll be sorely missed.\nJay, you talked a little bit about the public sector and the US federal. Just curious if there's been any update on DoD and Thunderdome and any of the big projects there? They've been looking at doing a revitalization, and you seem to be primed for that. We'd love to hear where that stands.\nJay Chaudhry\nSo we continue to gain share in federal market across the board. One of the things I'm proud of is now we reached 14 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies as our customers. Across defense too, we have a number of initiatives. We have talked about some of them in the past.\nWe think we have very, very big opportunity out there. And with the new administration coming on board, we are all reading about the push for cost reduction. I believe that's a positive for us for our federal business. This is because we reduce cost and complexity.\nWe eliminate North-South, East-West firewalls, VPN, NAC, segmentation, all of those kind of products. So I'm excited about the federal opportunities. And it's not just the US. We're taking the same kind of solutions to some of the Western friendly, NATO friendly countries as well.\nOperator\nFatima Boolani, Citi.\nFatima Boolani\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I appreciate it. And, Remo, congratulations on an illustrious career.\nI wanted to ask you a question with regards to the updated billings guidance and some of the implied second-quarter billings based on some of the seasonality commentary you shared, Remo.\nIs there anything that we should think about vis-\u00e0-vis transactions that maybe landed early? Just trying to get a better sense of, hey, first quarter was really strong out of the gate, certainly relative to expectations. But why would we see some of that pare down in the second quarter? If you can give us some color around that. Thank you so much.\nRemo Canessa\nYeah. Our guide for the second quarter for billings is actually up. The 39.3% to 39.5% would indicate that for the second quarter.\nThe key thing is that we had a great first quarter. And if you take a look, we're passing the beat for the entire year. Really, fundamentally, nothing's changed what we talked about on the prior call. The key dynamic which is recurring is the scheduled billings at 7% in the first half and 23% in the second half. So nothing's really fundamentally changed.\nWhat I can say is that our pipeline supports our guidance. What I can say also is that hiring has been very good in our sales organization. Attrition is down. The go-to-market organization really is becoming very, very strong.\nSo as we go forward, it will become a more important part to Zscaler. So the second half basically, as we talked about -- and you have our guidance. We brought up guidance for the full year, and we feel comfortable with that.\nJay Chaudhry\nAbsolutely. Also, the same thing. The go-to-market execution of Mike Rich, the leadership team has been outstanding.\nOperator\nShrenik Kothari, Baird.\nShrenik Kothari\nHey. Congrats on the retirement, Remo. Great working with you, and good luck for the next chapter. Thanks for taking my questions.\nSo the shift to account-centric selling, of course, is yielding benefits already, Jay, you mentioned, with the pipeline quality. Just a follow-up to Brad's question on the bookings growth. And say, Remo and Jay, you mentioned about the partnership with GSIs facilitating significant deal wins. You mentioned about the seven-figure SD-WAN.\nCan you just help provide some more quantifiable color in terms of incremental ARR tied to GSI-led deals? And any more examples that highlight success with GSI, if that is leading to larger, bigger deals, or also longer sales cycles? And how should we think about the billings going forward?\nJay Chaudhry\nRight. Very good question. We are actually seeing increasing contribution of GSIs, especially in large accounts. I highlighted two deals, actually, this time that are driven by GSIs as strong partners. An auto supply parts company, this was a combination of zero trust segmentation and zero trust branch, eliminating the need for firewalls in lots and lots of factories and branches. They also -- GSI also helped us with G2K services company, where we sold protection for Microsoft and copilot type of stuff.\nI think the difference we're seeing is that GSIs are now working more closely with customers starting the early stage. And they are standardizing on some of our solutions. It used to be ZIA, ZPA, ZDX. Now, their standard solutions are including emerging products as well. So good momentum.\nAnd also, think of it, when we talk about eliminating a bunch of products, generally, those products end up being what? They are firewalls; they're VPN; they're SD-WANs; they're NAC or VDIs, they're device segmentation. It creates an opportunity for GSI partners to get services to replace -- take those products out.\nOver time, we'll start giving you more and more data about it. But I'll say, we are very pleased with the results, and this is because of the leadership we added to drive GSI that's making a big difference.\nOperator\nMatt Hedberg, RBC.\nMatthew Hedberg\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Lots of really good things to think about on this quarter.\nI guess I wanted to go back to the data protection solution. It seems like it's really contributing to large deals. And it's not the first time you've talked about It. I looked back; I think in Q4 of '23, fiscal '23, you talked about approaching [15] million of ARR. I think, at the time, it was growing about 60%.\nAny update on the scale of that business? I think it was about maybe about 12% of ARR back then. I have to imagine, it's been growing faster than the base business, but that feels like it's a really, really material contributor to new and emerging product growth.\nJay Chaudhry\nYes, data protection keeps on growing faster than our overall business. We are doing some big deals. I think with the emergence of AI, one of the biggest thing that's going to really help drive data protection is AI, because companies are worried about their data leaking out there as they start using more and more public AI services like ChatGPT, even Copilot falls under that area. And then, they'll be worried about private AI applications that our customers are building too.\nSo we have built probably the most comprehensive platform for data protection, not just inline data and end-point data for SaaS applications, data in the cloud with DSP around the world, and even data security for emails as well. I think you keep on seeing us.\nAnd the other comment I made was, as all large data protection exfiltration happens for Internet, we are sitting in line; we are naturally there. We're doing SSL/TLS inspection. So it's natural for expect to grow this business, and we're doing a good job with it.\nOperator\nRoger Boyd, UBS.\nRoger Boyd\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. And, Remo, sad to see you go, but I'll echo my congrats on your retirement there. It's been a pleasure.\nJay, just to follow up on data security, it seems like you're having a lot of traction upselling that data security portfolio. But I'm wondering to what extent that you've seen that holistic view that really only inline vendors can do start to influence new ZPA, ZIA deals and how big of a competitive differentiator you see that being going forward?\nJay Chaudhry\nData protection, majority of the time, it comes with ZIA, ZPA. It's such a large installed base. Our customers started on data protection side and had none or small data protection. So it's easy and natural for us to start that way.\nWe are seeing some of the customers who -- some of the prospects starting with interest on the data protection side as well. Those numbers are relatively small. The biggest products that are actually helping us with new logos without ZIA, ZPA are actually products like Airgap, zero trust device segmentation, or Avalor's Unified Vulnerability Management.\nLook, a company like Zscaler that has a large platform, we can sell a lot in installed base. We can also sell a lot of the new logo opportunities because of the big market for us there. That's why we don't really push for one or the other. We think both are important for us, and we are doing well in both areas.\nOperator\nThank you. And with that, I would now like to turn it back over to Jay Chaudhry for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry\nGreat. Well, thank you all for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you in one of the many conferences that we'll be participating in. See you then. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect and everyone, have a great day.\nView Comments"

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions. The one-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 4.74%, and its shares gained 15.69% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On December 2, 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $430.98 per share with a market capitalization of $3.204 trillion.\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) \u00a0in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over rising capex as Microsoft invests heavily in the burgeoning generative AI market. Investors are concerned about the rising capital intensity of the business and the uncertain return on that investment. We continue to believe that Microsoft occupies a strong competitive and strategic position and that it is poised to capture market share as businesses, both large and small, navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven productivity tools. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all scales. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of cutting-edge, AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT and its suite of Copilot applications, which enhance productivity and reduce costs.

          "whole_article": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 December 3, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, Super Micro Computer SMCI, Vaneck Semiconductor ETF SMH, Arm Holdings ARM and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.\nBuy Semis into Year End (Supply Concerns Overblown)\nUS equities have been on a tear since the bear market bottomed in late 2022, and the Fed began to cut interest rates. The tech sector, which was hit the hardest sector, has led the way back higher, driven higher specifically by hyper-scaling in the artificial intelligence industry.\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Nvidia is the most crucial stock in the most critical market area \u2013 artificial intelligence. Not only is NVDA significant due to its sheer size (its market cap is nearly $3.5 trillion), but it is also a key barometer for investors to gauge growth, and its best-in-class GPUs are an integral component for data centers that are being built by big tech companies like Microsoft.\nChatGPT Debut Set Off AI Arms Race\nOpen AI and Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot debut in November 2022 sparked the breakout of artificial intelligence. Though AI had been around for years before ChatGPT, the wild popularity ChatGPT sparked led to an AI arms race among cash-rich big tech companies like Meta Platforms. Since then, semiconductor stocks like NVDA have benefitted dramatically. That said, ballooning valuations in big tech stocks has Wall Street wondering whether growth can keep pace.\nNvidia Earnings Estimates Suggest More Growth\nNvidia and its iconic CEO, Jensen Huang, did a lot to quell these concerns in the November earnings conference call. Huang called demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest chip \u201cinsane,\u201d and Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimates echo this thinking (at least until 2027). Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to grow earnings per share by 125.38% year-over-year in 2025.\nSemis: Supply Is the Concern, Not the Demand\nWith the red-hot continued AI demand, the main concern for investors is whether Nvidia can keep up with supply. Peeling back the onion further, two concerns existed from the supply side, including:\n1. Blackwell Delays: Nvidia\u2019s next-generation AI chips were delayed due to design issues and overheating concerns discovered by Taiwan Semiconductor, an important supplier to Nvidia. However, these issues have reportedly been addressed, and production is expected to ramp up this month.\n2. SMCI Accounting Worries: Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer is another critical Nvidia supplier that designs high-performance computing (HPC) solutions used in AI chips. SMCI shares tanked for months after a notable short-selling firm raised accounting concerns, forcing SMCI to delay its earnings call. Nevertheless, the company announced today that a special committee forensic firm found no evidence of accounting fraud. In addition, the company announced they would replace their CFO, and shares jumped more than 20% in early trading on Monday.\nStory Continues\nPresently, NVDA supply concerns are under the rug.\nSMH Finds Buyers at Critical Technical Level\nBeyond the bullish supply news, investors have more reason to be bullish on semiconductor stocks into year-end. The Vaneck Semiconductor ETF a proxy for semis, is retreating to support at its 200-day moving average \u2013 a level that marked significant bottoms in the previous two instances.\nSemi Valuations Remain Attractive\nFinally, semiconductor valuations are attractive. While value-oriented investors may argue valuations are overheated in the industry, it\u2019s critical to remember that higher forward growth demands higher valuations. Stocks like Arm Holdings and Advanced Micro Devices have seen their valuations become more attractive as shares have consolidated.\nBottom Line\nSemiconductor stocks are ready to rally into year-end after Nvidia supply issues were quelled and a bullish technical and valuation environment emerges.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Our strong demand for the Zscaler platform, growing pipeline, and increased sales capacity give us confidence in our guidance for the second half. - Remo Canessa, CFO & Jay Chaudhry, CEO\nStory Continues\nQ: How is Zscaler collaborating with Microsoft to support the rollout of Microsoft Copilot, and how does this impact your competition with Varonis? A: We leverage our integration with Microsoft for data discovery and classification, providing a unique advantage by being in line for all Office 365 traffic. This allows us to secure Microsoft Copilot effectively, as demonstrated by a seven-figure deal with a G2000 company. Our position in the traffic path gives us a competitive edge. - Jay Chaudhry, CEO\nQ: How significant is ZPA as a growth driver, and what is the current state of the VPN replacement cycle? A: VPNs are still prevalent, but ZPA is a major growth driver, now accounting for over 40% of new and upsell business. The opportunity extends beyond VPN replacement to include zero trust segmentation. We expect all customers to eventually adopt ZIA, ZPA, and ZDX. - Jay Chaudhry, CEO\nQ: How does Zscaler's growth compare to firewall vendors, and what opportunities arise from hardware refresh cycles? A: Our growth significantly outpaces firewall vendors. Firewall refresh cycles present opportunities for us to replace traditional firewalls with our zero trust solutions, including SD-WAN and device segmentation, which are gaining customer interest. - Jay Chaudhry, CEO\nQ: Can you elaborate on the impact of emerging products on unscheduled billings growth and which products are driving this growth? A: The growth is driven by both emerging and core products. Emerging products like AI, workload protection, and ZDX are performing well. We expect emerging products to account for a mid-20% range of new and upsell business. - Remo Canessa, CFO & Jay Chaudhry, CEO\nQ: What is the current ARR target, and how are emerging products contributing to new business activity? A: Our ARR target for the year is $3 billion, with a net retention rate of 114%. Emerging products like ZDX, zero trust branch, and AI solutions are significant contributors, expected to account for a mid-20% range of new and upsell business. - Remo Canessa, CFO & Jay Chaudhry, CEO\nQ: How is Zscaler addressing customer scrutiny on large deals, and what role does AI play in your solutions? A: Customer scrutiny is a general economic trend, but our zero trust solutions, combined with AI, help reduce costs and complexity, making us attractive to customers. AI is a catalyst for our growth, enhancing our security offerings. - Remo Canessa, CFO & Jay Chaudhry, CEO\nQ: What progress has been made with Avalor and how does Zscaler handle the scale of data and traffic? A: Avalor has enabled us to build a data fabric for efficient SecOps. We have introduced products like Risk360 and unified vulnerability management. Our ability to handle large volumes of data and traffic is a competitive advantage, allowing us to offer breach prediction and threat hunting. - Jay Chaudhry, CEO\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The confirmed changes will be made based on data at market close on Tuesday 3 December and will be announced after market close on Wednesday 4 December.\nRead more: Global chip stocks to consider as investments beyond Nvidia\nThe indices are reshuffled every quarter according to market cap data from the end of the previous month.\nWhile the FTSE 100 is nearly 8% in the green year-to-date, trading has been choppier in November. Uncertainty over the impact of policy changes announced in the budget, in potentially nudging inflation higher and thereby keeping interest rates higher for longer, as well as Donald Trump's election victory in the US, have weighed on investor sentiment.\nHowever, there is also specific company news that has driven certain stocks higher and lower.\nVistry Group\nShares in Vistry plummeted in October, on the back of a profit warning issued after the housebuilder discovered costs in one of its business divisions had been understated.\nVistry said in a trading update at the time that it had discovered that cost projections to complete nine of its 46 developments in its south division had been \"understated\" by around 10% of the total build costs. As a result, it estimated seeing a one-off impact for revising cost assumptions, expecting profits before tax to be \u00a380m than previously forecast, at \u00a3350m ($442m).\nRead more: Eurozone inflation creeps up to 2.3% in November\nIn another trading update in early November, Vistry then lowered its pre-tax profit guidance from \u00a3350m to \u00a3300m, as more details came to light around its cost issues in the division.\nThe stock is now down 31% year-to-date, giving it a market capitalisation of \u00a32.18bn, according to London Stock Exchange Group data.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said Vistry \"had been chasing faster-than-average growth since its transition to a Partnership giant, specialising in providing affordable housing by teaming up with local authorities.\n\"But the scale of recent profit downgrades raised big questions about the new structure and internal controls, and seriously dented the share price.\"\nStory continues\n\u2022 USD\n(VTY.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nFrasers Group (FRAS.L)\nMike Ashley's retail company Frasers Group is another stock that could be relegated from the FTSE 100, according to LSEG. It has the second smallest market capitalisation in the FTSE 100, at \u00a33.32bn, with shares down 19% so far this year.\n\"Fraser Group\u2019s attempts to wrestle more control of companies its invested in, notably Mulberry (MUL.L) and Boohoo (BOO.L) has been watched closely, and the constant rebuffing has also caused some extra volatility in the share price,\" said Streeter.\nFrasers has been embroiled in a public row with fast-fashion retailer Boohoo, most recently calling for Mahmud Kamani to be removed as Boohoo's executive chairman and appoint Ashley as a director, along with restructuring expert Mike Lennon. The same morning, Boohoo announced it had appointed Tim Morris as the company's independent chair and instead, made Kamani executive vice-chair.\nRead more: Stocks to watch this week: Salesforce, Lululemon, Frasers Group, Berkeley and Foot Locker\nPrior to this, Frasers called for Boohoo to appoint Ashley as CEO but this request was shunned by the fast-fashion retailer, who opted to appoint Dan Finley as boss instead.\nLuxury handbag maker Mulberry (MUL.L) also rejected a takeover bid of \u00a3111m ($141m) from Frasers Group in October.\nIn addition to this, Streeter said that Frasers' \"brand elevation strategy with the company integrating luxury names into its offering is tricky, when aspirational shoppers are more wary about splashing the cash\".\nShe said that its Sports Direct chain was contending with the \"ongoing shift from bricks and mortar to online and falling footfall for department stores\", while \"the closure of several legacy House of Fraser shops has dented profitability in the short term\".\nThe confirmation of its relegation could come before Frasers Group releases its half-year results on Thursday 5 December.\n\u2022 USD\n(FRAS.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nB&M European Value Retail (BME.L)\nAnother stock that FTSE Russell has advised could be knocked out of the FTSE 100, is bargain retailer B&M European Value Retail.\nShares are down 39% year-to-date, giving the retailer a market capitalisation of \u00a33.48bn.\nB&M reported a mixed bag of results last month, posting 3.7% group revenue growth at \u00a32.1bn in the first half.

Let's take a closer look at the semiconductor company's biggest moments with\u00a0Beyond the Ticker. 1969 AMD was founded by Jerry Sanders and a group of seven other individuals. 1972 The company went public on September 27, 1972, at $15.50 per share, bringing in a a total of $7.5 million. 1982 AMD and its main competitor Intel (INTC) signed a 10-year technology exchange agreement, as part of a deal to supply chips to IBM (IBM). 1991 AMD released the Am386, its version of the Intel 386 microprocessor, leading to a legal battle between the two companies. 1994 AMD landed a major deal with Compaq to supply Am486 processors to power Compaq PCs. 1996 AMD purchased NexGen for $857 million in stock, to take on Intel\u2019s Pentium line of chips. 1999 AMD introduced the Athlon processor, the first 1-GHz microprocessor. 2003 AMD launched the Opteron, the company's first server-oriented processor. 2006 AMD acquired ATI Technologies for $5.4 billion, pushing ahead into the graphics card business for high-end gaming and design PCs. 2009 Intel agreed to paid AMD $1.25 billion as part of the pairs\u2019 long-running antitrust battle. 2013 Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SONY) chose AMD as the chip provider for the Xbox One and PS4 game consoles. 2017 AMD debuted its new Ryzen line of chips aimed directly at taking on Intel\u2019s top-of-the-line offerings. 2023 AMD acquired open-source AI software provider Nod.ai to boost its AI capabilities.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks.\nKen Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors.\nFisher said, \"I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused.\"\nBesides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors.\nIn the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips.\nREAD ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams\u2019 Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks.\nEven though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better.\n\"Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly,\" Ken Fisher said.\nKen Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the \"magnificent seven\" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions.\nStory Continues\n\"If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward\", Fisher said in a video interview.\nOur Methodology\nWe looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm's stake at the end of Q3 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nFisher Asset Management\u2019s Equity Stake: $12.01 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops and supports software, services and devices worldwide. In addition to offering Office Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 copilot, it also provides cloud computing solutions under Azure. The company also generates significant revenues through its gaming unit under Xbox. It is one of billionaire Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks heading into 2025 as an investment play around artificial intelligence.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s early investments in OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, helped it outpace some of its AI competitors. Its $14 billion investment in OpenAI has given it access to advanced AI solutions that it is using to enhance its search engine and cloud offerings.\nIn addition, about 70% of Fortune 500 companies already use Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s AI offering under Microsoft 365 Copilot AI. Similarly, AI business and offerings are on course to become a key revenue generator with a run rate of about $10 billion.\nAs demand for cloud computing solutions increases, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) should be one of the biggest beneficiaries. The company controls about 20% of the market share, just behind Amazon in the segment. MSFT's Azure cloud services revenue was up 33% in the Fiscal 2025 first quarter. The increase underscores the company's long-term prospects in the burgeoning segment.\nHere is what Alger Spectra Fund said about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after Microsoft reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue growth in its Azure cloud segment. Additionally, management\u2019s fiscal first[1]quarter 2025 Azure revenue guidance came in slightly below estimates. Despite this shortfall, management highlighted that AI contributed 7% to cloud growth, up from 6% last quarter and 3% a year ago. We continue to believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain a leadership role in AI, given its innovative approach and significant growth potential.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +16%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 8.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -78.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +20.7%. This estimate has changed +10.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.36 indicates a change of +16.8% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +22.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.93 billion and $4.73 billion estimates indicate +28.5% and +20.4% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $1.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $982.26 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.84%. The EPS surprise was +14.81%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Have you evaluated the performance of CrowdStrike Holdings' (CRWD) international operations during the quarter that concluded in October 2024? Considering the extensive worldwide presence of this cloud-based security company, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial resilience and potential for growth.\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\nUpon examining CRWD's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\nFor the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $1.01 billion, experiencing an increase of 28.5% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of CRWD's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations.\nA Closer Look at CRWD's Revenue Streams Abroad\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa accounted for 15.90% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $160.57 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +2.08%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $157.3 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe, Middle East, and Africa contributed $148.85 million (15.44%) and $119.16 million (15.16%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Other International contributed $63.29 million in revenue, making up 6.27% of the total revenue.

Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\nIn an era of growing international ties and escalating geopolitical disputes, financial analysts on Wall Street pay keen attention to these developments to fine-tune their earnings estimations for businesses operating across borders.

The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating mechanism, demonstrates a notable performance history confirmed through external audits.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading cybersecurity software company. Following a long period of outsized gains, shares fell 29.5% in the quarter after a software glitch caused a global Microsoft outage in July. Despite the outage, the company delivered solid second quarter results that exceeded the high end of expectations across all key metrics. Management called out several delayed deals but noted that they remained in the pipeline and should close in coming quarters. Increased scrutiny and the implementation of new incentives, including discounts and free products and flexibility on billings, will likely negatively impact bookings and revenue growth over the near term. While the range of outcomes on the implications of the outage on customer retention and willingness to expand with CrowdStrike remains wider than usual, leading us to reduce our position, we believe that the fact that the incident was not due to a breach, the company\u2019s competitively advantaged product, its transparent and rapid response, and the new procedures it had put in place, should help it retain its customers and grow wallet share over time.\"\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive \u201ccritical shock\u201d for the country\u2019s fiscal health.\nREAD NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings\nThe Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years.\n\u201cThe use of AI presents the rare \u2014 possibly unique \u2014 opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system\u201d.\nWhile adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists\u2019 outlook on AI and healthcare is \u201ca mix of enthusiasm and despair\u201d.\n\u201cEnthusiasm because there\u2019s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. \u2026 But there\u2019s friction due to regulation, due to incentives \u2014 because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things \u2014 and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities\u201d.\nIn other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStory Continues\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in cloud-delivered endpoint and cloud workload protection. On November 27, Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari raised the firm\u2019s price target on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD to $390 from $375 and kept an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on the shares. According to Baird, Crowdstrike has delivered a strong Q3 powered by its growth of Falcon Flex, the company\u2019s definitive AI-native cybersecurity platform. However, some challenges were also highlighted such as extended sales cycles and temporary volatility in ARR/FCF momentum.\nOverall CRWD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, CrowdStrike Holdings fair value estimate is US$335\nCrowdStrike Holdings' US$348 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\nAnalyst price target for CRWD is US$370, which is 10% above our fair value estimate\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nThe Model\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$1.06b\nUS$1.38b\nUS$1.78b\nUS$2.05b\nUS$2.99b\nUS$3.54b\nUS$4.02b\nUS$4.43b\nUS$4.78b\nUS$5.09b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x28\nAnalyst x30\nAnalyst x21\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 18.26%\nEst @ 13.56%\nEst @ 10.28%\nEst @ 7.98%\nEst @ 6.37%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%\nUS$989\nUS$1.2k\nUS$1.5k\nUS$1.6k\nUS$2.1k\nUS$2.4k\nUS$2.5k\nUS$2.6k\nUS$2.6k\nUS$2.6k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20b\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$5.1b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$122b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$122b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$62b\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$82b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$348, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Discounted Cash Flow November 29th 2024\nThe Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CrowdStrike Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.041. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nExpensive based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nLooking Ahead:\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. The report adds that these workers complete projects for internal business units at the ride hailing company but are also serving outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic. The company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the US, Canada, and India, among others.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOver the past few years, even though the firm is yet to launch an eye-catching AI product, it has incorporated AI internally to streamline operations. For example, the AI algorithms of the firm efficiently match riders with drivers to minimize waiting times and maximize driver utilization. These algorithms predict demand, analyze traffic patterns, and estimate trip durations to offer real-time ride assignments. Similarly, the company heavily invests in AI for self-driving car technology. AI systems in these vehicles process data from LiDAR, cameras, and sensors to navigate roads, identify objects, and make decisions in real time.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The firm is harnessing artificial intelligence to streamline and strengthen cyber protection. On November 27, BMO Capital raised the price target on the stock to $380 from $315 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. Crowdstrike's results were reasonable, though net new annual recurring revenue upside and implied January quarter ARR likely fell slightly short of consensus expectations, the advisory tells investors in a research note. The ongoing headwinds from more customer commitment packages will likely move consensus ARR estimates lower for the next few quarters, but management continues to execute well, BMO says.\nStory Continues\nOverall CRWD ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks on Wall Street's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- The abrupt departure of Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger offers a fresh opportunity for the troubled company to consider potential deal options, including scenarios that he rejected during his time running the chipmaker.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAs Wars Rage, Cities Face a Dark New Era of Urban Destruction\nRiyadh Metro Partially Opens in Bid to Ease City\u2019s Traffic Jams\nThe board has discussed a range of possibilities in recent months, such as private equity transactions and even a split of Intel\u2019s factory and product-design businesses. But Gelsinger was opposed to breaking up the company, focusing instead on his plan to restore Intel\u2019s technological edge and become a made-to-order manufacturer for outside clients.\nGelsinger left this week following pressure from the board and is set to receive as much as $10 million in severance pay. With his departure, there\u2019s a chance to reset the conversation. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have been helping the company ponder its options, and may find a more receptive audience in new management.\nIt\u2019s also an opportunity for suitors to take another look at acquiring some or all of the business. Qualcomm Inc. expressed some interest in a transaction before, though nothing got very far, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\u201cThis leadership change increases the probability of divestitures,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kunjan Sobhani and Oscar Hernandez Tejada said in a note Monday. \u201cGelsinger was firmly against breaking up the company, but the prolonged and expensive turnaround has tested shareholder patience, potentially forcing Intel to reconsider.\u201d\nIntel\u2019s board evaluated a number of scenarios during a critical meeting in September, including the idea of a breakup. The discussions followed an abysmal earnings report the previous month, when Intel posted a surprise loss and a disappointing sales forecast.\nBut Intel pushed forward with less radical changes, including a pause in the construction of plants in Poland and Germany. The company also is slashing roughly 15,000 jobs and suspended its decades-old dividend \u2014 part of attempts to conserve cash and keep Gelsinger\u2019s turnaround plan on track.\nIf the new CEO goes ahead with a bigger shake-up, these are deal ideas that Intel could revisit:\n1. Splitting Factory and Product Divisions\nThis would involve fully separating Intel\u2019s factory business from the more profitable unit that develops products. Under Gelsinger, the company has been expanding its manufacturing operations to become a foundry \u2014 a maker of components for outside customers. The idea is to eventually compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a pioneer of the foundry approach.\nStory Continues\nBut Intel has only announced a few big clients for its foundry operations, and production of high-end chips isn\u2019t large enough to make the endeavor profitable. Perhaps worse, sales have been sliding \u2014 an ominous sign for a business pushing into a big new industry segment.\nThough Intel might be able to find a suitor for its product division, the foundry operation would be a harder sell. The largest US chip foundry is GlobalFoundries Inc., which has its own struggles. That company lacks cash or experience in running the type of manufacturing that Intel\u2019s factories were built for.\nIt\u2019s also unclear if a new Intel CEO \u2014 or the rest of the board \u2014 would be ready to dismantle a company that once ruled the chip industry. And the move could complicate Intel\u2019s ability to get $7.9 billion in federal grants under the US Chips and Science Act, a law aimed at revitalizing domestic chip production.\nA representative for Santa Clara, California-based Intel declined to comment. The Commerce Department, which is in charge of Chips Act incentives, said of Gelsinger\u2019s departure that \u201cevolutions and transitions in the industry are to be expected,\u201d and the agency will stay focused on advancing economic and national security while safeguarding taxpayer dollars. Chips Act awards are dependent on reaching certain milestones, and they follow months of due diligence.\n2. Lure a Suitor Like Qualcomm\nBloomberg has reported that Qualcomm considered an Intel acquisition, but its interest had cooled as of last week. The complexities associated with acquiring all of Intel made a deal less attractive, people familiar with the matter said at the time.\nBut Qualcomm could consider buying pieces of Intel, such as the product business. Like much of the chip industry, Qualcomm doesn\u2019t manufacture its own semiconductors. Instead, it designs chips and relies on partners like TSMC to handle production. That\u2019s why it\u2019s unlikely to want Intel\u2019s factory operations.\nBroadcom Inc. previously assessed whether to pursue an Intel deal, but it didn\u2019t move ahead with talks, Bloomberg reported in September. When Broadcom CEO Hock Tan was asked that month if he might seek a chip acquisition, he said his hands were full integrating the purchase of VMware.\nAny big chip merger also would face regulatory hurdles around the world \u2014 something both Qualcomm and Broadcom know well. Broadcom scuttled an attempt to buy Qualcomm after the deal was blocked by President Donald Trump in 2018.\n3. Selling Altera\nIntel\u2019s Altera unit, acquired in 2015 for about $17 billion, makes chips that can be reprogrammed for different uses after they\u2019re manufactured. Intel has held negotiations about selling a portion of the business to financial investors, a potential step toward an initial public offering for the unit.\nBuyout firms such as Francisco Partners, Bain Capital and Silver Lake Management have been studying offers to invest in Altera. Last month, though, Bloomberg reported that Lattice Semiconductor Corp. was considering making an offer for all of Altera. Lattice is working with advisers and is seeking a private equity backer as it explores a potential bid, people familiar with the process said.\nWhether or not such a deal moves forward, the idea of unloading the entirety of Altera could have fresh momentum under a new Intel CEO.\n4. An Apollo Investment\nApollo offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel earlier this year. The New York-based firm indicated that it would be willing to make an equity-like investment of as much as $5 billion, Bloomberg reported in September. But negotiations didn\u2019t lead to an announcement.\nApollo has an existing relationship with Intel. The firm agreed in June to buy a stake in a venture that controls an Intel chip plant in Ireland for $11 billion. That makes it more likely that the partners will engage in further talks.\n5. A Mobileye Transaction\nIntel acquired Mobileye, a maker of self-driving technology, in 2017. Though the business went public in 2022, Intel still owns most of the company. That situation has the potential to change under a new CEO.\nIn September, Intel said it isn\u2019t \u201ccurrently\u201d planning to divest its majority stake in Mobileye. But Bloomberg reported earlier in the month that the chipmaker was contemplating options for its 88% holding.\nIntel could offload some of the stake in the public market or via a sale to a third party, people familiar with the discussions said. In any case, it\u2019s unlikely to be a winning investment for Intel, which paid about $15 billion for Mobileye. The company currently has a market value of $14.1 billion.\n--With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins.\n(Updates with Commerce Department\u2019s comment in 13th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nMusk\u2019s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape\nTop Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Analysts said this change reflects Credo's transition towards a more profitable earnings growth model, particularly as it enters a multi-year adoption cycle for its Active Electrical Cable (AEC) product, which is instrumental for power-efficient AI clusters.\nFor the near term, BofA anticipates a strong second half for fiscal year 2025, driven by robust AI growth at Amazon Web Services, a key customer and investor in Credo.\n\u201cOur prior cautious view was based on limited TAM assumptions for AEC, but CRDO\u2019s earnings call addressed those concerns nicely, with 3x 10% customers, and growing momentum in other adjacent areas,\u201d analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote.\nAccording to BofA\u2019s note, Credo is expected to maintain operational expenditure growth at less than half of its sales growth over the next few years, with gross margins remaining resilient. This suggests significant operational leverage and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 74% in earnings per share between calendar years 2024-2027, compared to a 45% CAGR in sales.\nFurthermore, the company now boasts seven customers that each contribute more than 5% to sales, up from two in the previous quarter.\nBofA also highlights Credo\u2019s broadening product exposure and growing exposure to coveted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s AI chip Trainium2.\nDespite the positive outlook, BofA notes potential risks associated with Credo's premium valuation, sensitivity to shifts in AI deployment sentiment, and intensifying competition in the AEC market from companies like Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nAlso, gross margins are expected to remain flat in fiscal year 2025, while competitive pressures persist in AECs and other AI-related products. Additionally, sales concentration remains high, with three large hyperscale AEC customers comprising 58% of total sales.\nStory Continues\nRelated Articles\nBofA double upgrades Credo stock after strong Q3 print\nStanChart targets $200 billion in new wealth assets over next five years\nBig hedge funds score November gains with Trump election\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks.\nKen Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors.\nFisher said, \"I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused.\"\nBesides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors.\nIn the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips.\nREAD ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams\u2019 Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks.\nEven though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better.\n\"Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly,\" Ken Fisher said.\nKen Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the \"magnificent seven\" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions.\nStory Continues\n\"If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward\", Fisher said in a video interview.\nOur Methodology\nWe looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks.\nAs 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. They beckon 2025 with a rather historic run on the stock market that has seen several high-growth technology stocks flourish despite the fact that until September, interest rates in the US were at a two-decade high level.\nDriving the bullishness behind technology stocks is artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that relies on high-end GPUs to run advanced mathematical techniques and infer new conclusions from existing data sets has been the focus of Wall Street and big technology companies. So far, most of the AI-related stock gains have been limited to the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite graphics processing unit (GPU) company whose stock is up by more than\u00a0700%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nHowever, the gains have to broaden out to other stocks for the AI wave to continue. This broadening is dependent on the use of AI increasing among businesses and consumers. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo has some insights to share. In its report titled \u2018Generative AI \u2014 Potential pitfalls, challenges, and risks the bank outlines that while AI \u201chas the potential to be broadly transformative,\u201d there are several \u201coutstanding questions and concerns that need to be addressed before it is widely accepted on a larger scale.\u201d Quoting its \u2018The AI Index 2024 Annual Report,\u2019 the bank points out that from 2012 to 2023, the number of AI incidents has jumped more than tenfold from sitting at roughly 10 to ~122. These incidents cover the ethical misuse of AI such as the wrong detection of criminals stemming from facial recognition systems.\nWF\u00a0points\u00a0out that while these incidents are concerning, other factors will also determine AI\u2019s wider acceptability and use. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints. The bank adds that these factors are also accompanied by the potentially transformative effect of AI on the labor market. Starting from its beliefs about the labor market, WF believes that generative AI, which is different from other AI systems such as machine learning, will have a more \u201cnuanced\u201d impact on the labor market compared to traditional AI. Commenting on common worries of AI taking jobs away, the bank outlines that the jobs that AI will replace will in turn be replaced by new jobs created by AI. To quote WF, it believes \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s disruptive effect on the labor market to mirror other forms of automation \u2014 as in the past, its impact likely will be mitigated over time by new occupations spawned by the innovations themselves.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTo help bolster its claim, WF shares data from MIT. It points out that MIT\u2019s estimates show that \u201c60% of U.S. workers are now employed in occupations that did not exist 84 years ago.\u201d As for which job functions might give way to AI, these include knowledge-based roles such as those found in financial services and support roles such as those performed by customer support agents.\nTwo additional key disruptive AI effects that Wall Street in particular is keenly aware of are its rising costs and the effect on the utility industry. The S&P\u2019s utility sector is up by 28.36% year-to-date which leads the broader index\u2019s 26.48% in gains by nearly two percentage points. Commenting on this, the bank believes that \u201cthere will be a significant increase in hardware demand, notably within the data-center environment, to accommodate the substantial increase in AI workloads,\u201d adding that \u201cit may take a number of years to increase the operational efficiency of various large language models and decrease costs to a level more in-line with existing search engines.\u201d WF also shares that while existing opportunities to expand data center footprint to accommodate AI are present, as they \u201cdiminish, companies may revisit existing data-center locations to retrofit and upgrade hardware and infrastructure in support of the power and data-consumption needs of new AI technologies.\u201d\nGiven the criticality of the data center space to AI, WF expands on this sector in another\u00a0report. Titled \u2018Generative AI transforming data center landscape\u201d it comments on the capital expenditure required to set up data centers, future trends for data centers, and the stock market sectors that might benefit from growing interest and focus on the data center industry. According to its analysis, investor attention is mostly focused on AI-related investments in semiconductors and cloud computing.\nHowever, other sectors, such as \u201ccabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators\u201d are also important. WF quotes a utility company to explain why these tertiary sectors are critical in the AI wave. It shares that utility company believes that \u201cthe server rack power density required to train a generative-AI-based large language model can require up to five to seven times more power than server racks used for traditional IT workloads in a data center.\u201d\nWhile semiconductor companies are natural beneficiaries of the AI boom, some oft-ignored sectors that WF mentions are industrials and materials. It outlines that when it comes to building massive data centers, estimates suggest \u201cthat approximately 35% \u2013 45% of the cost is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out. These areas are addressable by companies who supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors).\u201d Additionally, \u201c40% \u2013 45% and 15% \u2013 20% of the remaining cost can be attributed to electrical and HVAC systems respectively,\u201d according to Wells Fargo. AI is having an effect on materials, as per the bank, in the form of \u201cincreased demand for materials that are used in the production of semiconductor chips, water handling and recycling within data centers, and steel and construction materials to build data centers.\u201d\nFor some materials stocks and a primer on how they are reliant on the broader economic activity, you can check out\u00a010 Best Materials Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s top AI & non-AI stocks that can outpace the flagship S&P, we selected technology-focused stocks from the bank\u2019s recent Focus List and ranked them by their consensus next twelve-month EPS estimates.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(AVGO) the Top Wells Fargo\u2019s Tech Stock to Beat the S&P?\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 128\nNTM EPS Estimate: $5.91\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor designer and cybersecurity software provider. Its dual model offers it exposure to broader consumer and enterprise semiconductor demand as well as a source of high-margin recurring revenue via the cybersecurity business. The key AI exposure enjoyed by Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is through the chip design business as it has the potential to partner up with firms such as OpenAI to design AI chips that help the industry shift away from NVIDIA\u2019s pricey GPUs that also suffer from supply constraints due to high demand. Conversely, the firm also depends on the consumer electronics industry which in turn is susceptible to cyclical slowdowns. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s acquisition of VMWare has also enabled the firm to grow its revenue. Consequently, an uptick in industrial and consumer sectors can inject tailwinds into Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s shares and the firm can benefit from a growing push towards custom AI chips.\nColumbia Threadneedle Investments mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cSimilar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company\u2019s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks. AVGO is a top cyclical stock Wells Fargo is confident about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to buy for long term growth.\nStrategist Expects S&P 500 to reach 6,600\nSome investors consider 2024 as a transition year, while others debate that this year was just the beginning of the level of volatility awaiting financial markets in 2025. It is not an exaggeration to say that 2024 has been rough for markets given that crucial events like the commencement of an easing cycle followed by the US elections remained a major influence on the overall environment. Amid all these awaited events, the tech sector has not been an investor favorite, however, that may change sooner than we think.\nOn November 26, Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, joined\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his opinion on the stock market, particularly the tech sector. Krishna raised his S&P 500 price target for 2025 to 6,600 and shed light on why he believes such is possible.\nHe shared that the economy is pretty constructive from a macro perspective given that the virtuous cycle between income and employment remains solid. He added that consumer balances are going up and believes that the overall economic conditions of the country have been positive. All these reasons combined explain the price target of 6,600 for the S&P 500.\nSpeaking of the technology sector, Krishna agreed that the \u201cmarket is, on a consistent basis, underestimating the earnings power of tech, especially big tech.\u201d He added that at the same time, the market is also overestimating the earnings power of the other non-tech names in the S&P 500. He shared that the market expected Big Tech to post earnings up by 19% year-over-year and have \u201cflat revisions\u201d in the third quarter. Non-tech stocks on the other hand were marked down by 2%.\nHowever, Krishna revealed that as the earnings period of Q3 2024 comes to a close, Big Tech actually delivered 31% of earnings growth during the quarter. He added that non-tech stocks have moved in the same direction but only incrementally. He explained that, for example, non-tech stocks were originally marked down, but instead, they expanded by 2%, accelerating at a very slow pace.\nHe also emphasized that the rate at which the market expects Big Tech earnings to slow down is in reality much lower than the actual deceleration rate. Overall, Krishna expects the market to converge but highlighted that it may not be as close as we expect it to be, probably not sooner than Q1 2026.\nStory Continues\nWhile turmoil and uncertainty remain a key element in the market, some stocks are revolutionary enough that they are bound to offer great opportunities in the coming years, if not now.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the best stocks to buy for long term growth we sifted through multiple rankings on the internet. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and ranked them in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nWhy Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) is Best Stock to Buy For Long Term Growth?\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\n2024 has been incredible for AVGO. Earlier this year, the company launched breakthrough technologies able to manage AI tasks and scalable AI systems. On November 5th, the company unveiled VeloRAIN, a platform that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the performance of AI security workloads. On the same day, the company launched a private cloud platform under its VMware Cloud Foundation to improve customers\u2019 AI autonomy and security.\nThe company also forged prominent partnerships throughout the year. To align with its strategic trajectory, on November 5, the company expanded its partnership with Telia to revolutionize Telco and Cloud infrastructure. Overall, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially to $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion, driven by ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers in Q4 2024.\nBroadcom Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) emphasis on introducing groundbreaking technologies is immense and is also its economic moat. At the moment, company officials believe AVGO is finally achieving stability on a company-wide level and is on track to becoming a technology powerhouse.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 8th on our list of best stocks to buy for long term growth. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

If you look at the image below, you can see Broadcom has a lower ROE than the average (11%) in the Semiconductor industry classification.\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Return on Equity December 2nd 2024\nUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Broadcom visit our risks dashboard for free.\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\nBroadcom's Debt And Its 8.4% ROE\nBroadcom does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.06. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\nStory Continues\nConclusion\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stock picks in Brad Gerstner's portfolio.\nGerstner Expects More M&As in New Term\nStrategists and investors are confident that the new administration will fuel the state of mergers and acquisitions in the United States. It is no surprise that renowned investor Brad Gerstner, founder and CEO of\u00a0Altimeter Capital,\u00a0believes the same. On November 6, Gerstner\u00a0appeared in an interview on\u00a0CNBC Television\u00a0where he shared his expectations of the stock market.\nGerstner shares that the Republicans have been particularly critical of big tech companies and their \u201cbundling powers\u201d that happen to \u201ccrowd out startups\u201d and \u201cstifle innovation and startups.\u201d He expects the new administration to scrutinize this trend heavily. He also adds that the true beauty of Silicon Valley lies in the innovation and technology bolstered by small tech and mergers and acquisitions.\nSpeaking of big tech, he suggests that these names have been cutting down on M&A deals and have instead directed their resources to stock repurchases, dividends, and onboarding new GPUs. He expects the new administration to alter the trend and loosen up the ability to do mergers and acquisitions.\nGertsner also suggests that the US market will be better off with a functioning mergers and acquisitions flow in Silicon Valley, which he refers to as the \u201cheartbeat\u201d of the place. He also shared his thoughts on the program, Invest America, which is expected to provide kids with $1,000 in seed money into investment accounts as soon as they are born. He has been working with leading lawmakers in the country to promote the program and is highly optimistic about its outcomes.\nGerstner is bullish on the program and highlighted that the move will bring a new era of enterprise, innovation, and capital management to the US economy. He added that this program will bolster the private market and likely create 3.7 million new stock market investors yearly. In addition to investors like Brad Gerstner, many large tech companies are on board with the program.\nBrad Gerstner is one of the top technology investors and has had many notable transactions over the past few years through his firm. He is bullish on tech and innovation, particularly artificial intelligence. In Q3 2024, he initiated 8 new positions and also raised his stakes in 7 stocks, ending the quarter with a portfolio of $6.75 billion in 13F securities. With that, let\u2019s discuss his top new picks as of Q3 2024.\nStory Continues\nBrad Gerstner Altimeter Capital\nBrad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital\nOur Methodology\nWe scanned Altimeter Capital\u2019s Q3 2024 portfolio and picked new additions from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we\u2019ve also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nAltimeter Capital\u2019s Stake Value: $68,464,388\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks third on our list of the 7 new stock picks by Brad Gerstner. He trimmed his position in NVIDIA slightly and added AVGO to his portfolio. It designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.\nThroughout the year, the company has launched crucial breakthrough technology for AI tasks and AI systems. On November 5, the company announced the launch of VeloRain, an AI and ML platform that enhances AI security workloads. On the same day, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) unveiled a private cloud platform, part of its VMware Cloud Foundation, improving AI autonomy and security for its customers.\nAttributable to its growing stakes in AI, the company expects revenue from AI to increase 10% from the previous quarter to reach $3.5 billion. This will bring the full-year total to $12 billion. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) saw a 47% increase in consolidated revenue and a 44% increase in net income.\nAVGO\u2019s performance and growing importance in the AI sector explain why hedge funds are bullish on the stock. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, 128 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\nClearBridge Investments\u2019\u00a0ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of new stock picks in Brad Gerstner's portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "Stocks will enter the final month of 2024 near record highs as investors look to cap off what's been another stellar year for US stocks.\nDuring last week's holiday-shortened trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 2%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended November at all-time highs.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's November jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also scatter the schedule.\nInvestors will look to this week's economic data for clarity on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, which will be announced on Dec. 18.\nIn corporate news, earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Okta (OKTA), and Lululemon (LULU) will highlight the coming week's schedule.\n\u2022 USD\n(^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA labor look-in\nExpectations for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have shifted in recent months.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a 66% chance the Fed cuts rates at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But looking out further, markets are pricing in just two more rate cuts over the next year, with concerns growing about the Fed's progress on bringing down inflation.\nA labor market that continues to slow, but not dramatically, also likely keeps the Fed focused on inflation, which makes a less compelling case for aggressive rate cuts in 2025. An update on that narrative will come with the November jobs report, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nEconomists expect the report to show a reversal of the dismal October employment report that many believed was heavily impacted by hurricanes and worker strikes.\nThe November report is expected to show the US labor market added 200,000 jobs in the month, up from the 12,000 monthly job additions seen in October. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to have inched up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\"Through the monthly swings of nonfarm payrolls, we expect the November employment report to reiterate that while the labor market remains solid in an absolute sense, the softening trend in employment conditions has yet to cease,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients. \"That message is likely to come through more clearly from the unemployment rate, which we look to rise to 4.2%.\"\nStory Continues\n'Magnificent' earnings revisions\nWall Street strategists have been largely bullish when issuing 2025 forecasts, with strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance seeing the S&P 500 ending the year between 6,400 and 7,000. A frequent call in these outlooks has been for a continued broadening of the stock market rally away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 and toward the other 493 stocks in the index.\n\"We\u2019ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it\u2019s a close call,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote, emphasizing that another strong year of economic growth could help support the S&P 493.\nBut not everyone agrees. Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out that Big Tech continues to top earnings estimates each quarter. And as long as that streak continues, Krishna argued \"Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year.\"\nTo Krishna's point, while the broadening is expected to take place throughout next year, earnings revisions remain more positive for many Big Tech names than the rest of the S&P 500.\nIn a research note published on Nov. 27, DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe pointed out that six Big Tech companies have seen earnings revisions for the current quarter come in either flat or higher in the past 30 days. Only Microsoft and Apple have seen their earnings estimates cut more than the S&P 500's 1.2% estimate trim in that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500's 10 largest non-tech companies have seen earnings estimates slashed by an average of 2.7%.\n\"US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings,\" Rabe wrote. \"Fortunately, Big Tech makes up a third of the S&P, so their fundamentals have an outsized impact on the index.\"\nThe case for a strong December\nAnother popular call among strategists has been for the roaring bull market to continue through year-end, with more all-time highs in store before trading wraps up in 2024.\nAnd history supports that argument.\nCarson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that, in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 out of 10 times. Since 2000, the index has risen every December after a rally of this magnitude over the year's first 11 months.\n\"History says a chase into year-end is quite possible,\" Detrick wrote in a research note.\nWeekly Calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, November final (48.8 expected, 48.8 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, October (0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); ISM Manufacturing, November (47.6 expected, 46.5 previously); ISM prices paid, November (54.8 expected);\nEarnings: Zscaler (ZS)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: Job openings, October (7.51 million expected, 7.44 million previously);\nEarnings: Box (BOX), Marvell (MRVL), Okta (OKTA), Pure Storage (PSTG), Salesforce (CRM)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Nov. 29 (+6.3% previously); ADP Private Payrolls, November (+165,000 expected, +233,000 previously); S&P Global US Services PMI, November final (57 previously), S&P Global US Composite PMI, November final (55.3 previously); ISM Services index, November (55.5 expected, 56 previously); ISM Services prices paid, November (58.1 previously); Factory orders, October (0.3% expected, -0.5% previously); Durable goods orders, October final (+0.2% previously)\nEarnings: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Campbell's (CPB), ChargePoint (CHPT), Chewy (CHWY), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below (FIVE), Foot Locker (FL), Hormel Foods (HRL), RBC (RBC), Victoria's Secret (VSCO)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, November (+50.9% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Nov. 30 (213,000 previously)\nEarnings: BMO (BMO), Build-a-Bear Workshop (BBW), Dollar General (DG), DocuSign (DOCU), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Kroger (KR), Lululemon (LULU), Petco (WOOF), TD Bank (TD), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\nFriday\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, November (+200,000 expected, +12,000 previously); Unemployment rate, November (4.2% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+3.9% expected, +4% previously); Average weekly hours worked, November (34.3 expected, 34.3 previously); Labor force participation rate, November (62.6% previously)\nEarnings: BRP (DOOO)\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive \u201ccritical shock\u201d for the country\u2019s fiscal health.\nREAD NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings\nThe Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years.\n\u201cThe use of AI presents the rare \u2014 possibly unique \u2014 opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system\u201d.\nWhile adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists\u2019 outlook on AI and healthcare is \u201ca mix of enthusiasm and despair\u201d.\n\u201cEnthusiasm because there\u2019s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. \u2026 But there\u2019s friction due to regulation, due to incentives \u2014 because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things \u2014 and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities\u201d.\nIn other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Broadcom Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $14.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +51.3%. The $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +44% and +16.7%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We hope to see some of you at these events. Finally, our second quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period will begin on January 18.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nStory Continues\nRajiv Ramaswami\nThank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We are happy to report first-quarter results that came in ahead of our guidance. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership, our TCO.\nTaking a closer look at the first quarter, we exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $591 million. We grew our ARR 18% year over year to $1.966 billion. We also saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in new logos and solid free cash flow generation.\nOur largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to organizations that are looking to modernize their IT footprint, including adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models and modern applications while also managing through disruption from industry M&A.\nOne of our largest wins of the quarter was a full stack expansion with a global provider of IT consulting services based in the APAC region. This existing Nutanix customer expanded with us by shifting more workloads to our cloud platform, and adding additional components of our portfolio, enabling them to increase their automation and self-service capabilities while also reducing their exposure to their other incumbent infrastructure provider. This expansion was also aimed at strengthening their go-to-market practice with Nutanix in the areas of generating AI, modern applications, and competitive migrations.\nAnother notable win in Q1 was a significant expansion with a North American-based Fortune 100 provider of food services and products. This customer was looking to implement a hybrid multi-cloud environment with the intent of running more of their workloads in the public cloud and lowering their total cost of ownership while also reducing their exposure to our largest competitor. They chose the Nutanix Cloud platform, including our Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2, running on AWS, along with Nutanix Cloud Management. This enables them to reduce their projected TCO by nearly 50%, while also consolidating their existing data center footprint.\nOn the product front, we recently announced the general availability of GPT-in-a-Box 2.0, our solution for simplifying the deployment of generative AI applications. A key component of this offering is Nutanix Enterprise AI, or NAI, which helps streamline deployment scaling and running of influencing end points for large language models. NAI can be deployed within GPT-in-a-Box on-prem or at the edge or independently, on native public cloud services, such as AWS, EKS, and Azure AKF. These new capabilities help further our vision of becoming the leading platform for running all apps and managing data anywhere.\nA first-quarter new logo with the government ministry in the EMEA region demonstrated early progress with the new generative AI and modern application capabilities of our platform. This customer was looking to modernize their infrastructure and chose a full stack Nutanix solution to support development and deployment of their cloud-native and generative AI applications. They chose our GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution including our Nutanix Kubernetes Platform and Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure, as well as our Nutanix Unified storage and Nutanix Database Service offerings.\nMoving on, we also continue to make progress on the partnership front, signing an expanded strategic partnership with AWS that will simplify cloud migrations and offer access to AWS services for customers looking to migrate to NC2 on AWS. As part of this collaboration, customers will gain access to promotional credits from AWS to support customer migrations and proof-of-concept trials as well as Nutanix licensing promotions. Customers can also gain access to promotional credits for migrating VMware cloud and AWS workloads to NC2 on AWS through the AWS VMware migration accelerator program.\nFinally, we continue to receive industry recognition in Q1, being named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for distributed hybrid infrastructure, alongside some of the leading public cloud providers, improving from our challenged position in the 2023 Magic Quadrant.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our solid first-quarter results. Our ongoing innovation on our cloud platform, particularly with respect to its support for generative AI and modern applications and on the progress we continue to make on partnerships. We remain focused while driving sustainable, profitable growth.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Rajiv, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will first discuss our Q1 fiscal '25 results, followed by our guidance for Q2 fiscal '25 and an updated outlook for the full fiscal year 2025.\nResults in Q1 '25 came in above the high end of our range across our guided metrics. Revenue in Q1 was $591 million, higher than the guided range of $565 million to $575 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 16%. The outperformance in revenue was driven by good renewals execution. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.966 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%.\nWe saw strength in landing new customers onto our platform, helped by more leverage from our OEM and channel partners from the various programs we have put in place to incentivize new logos and from a general increase in engagement from customers looking at us as an alternative in the wake of industry M&A.\nNRR, or net dollar-based retention rate at the end of Q1 was 110%. Expansion with existing customers was impacted largely by our US federal business for which Q1 is a seasonally strong quarter given their September 30 fiscal year-end. Our US Fed business performance was lower year over year relative to the strong comparison from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to impacts from the elongated continuing resolution resulting in lighter spending from our Fed customers.\nBased on our current view, we expect our US federal business performance to return to more normal levels in the second quarter. In Q1, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels, which we believe is influenced by the macroeconomic environment and continued increased scrutiny on spend. In addition, as discussed during prior earnings calls, we believe the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure.\nThese factors also impact our ARR growth. Average contract duration in Q1 was to 3.1 years flat sequentially quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 87.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 20%, higher than our guided range of 14.5% to 15.5%, largely due to higher revenue and to a smaller extent, due to lower expenses including as a result of certain nonrecurring payments and credits.\nNon-GAAP net income in Q1 was $122 million, of fully diluted EPS of $0.42 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares. GAAP net income and fully diluted GAAP EPS in Q1 were $30 million and $0.10 per share, respectively. Free cash flow in Q1 was $152 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 26%.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalence and short-term investments of $1.075 billion up from $994 million at the end of Q4.\nMoving to capital allocation. We repurchased about $20 million worth of shares in Q1 and used about $79 million of cash in Q1 to retire shares related to our employees' STAC liability for their quarterly RSU vesting.\nMoving to Q2 '25. Our guidance for Q2 is as follows: revenue of $635 million to $645 million; non-GAAP operating margin of 20% to 21%; fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares.\nMoving to the full year. The updated guidance for fiscal year '25 is as follows: revenue of $2.435 billion to $2.465 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 14% at third point and no change from our initial guidance. The non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 16% to 17%, an increase from our previous guidance. Free cash flow of $560 million to $610 million, representing a free cash flow margin of approximately 24% at the midpoint and an increase of $15 million relative to our prior initial guidance at the midpoint.\nI will now provide some commentary and assumptions regarding our updated fiscal year '25 guidance. First, we are seeing continued land-and-expand opportunities and a growing pipeline for our solutions. However, as we have discussed previously, we expect continued uncertainty in the timing, outcome and deal structure from the growing mix of larger deals in the pipeline. And as I mentioned earlier, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels, which we believe is related to the uncertain spending environment and which we expect to continue.\nSecond, the guidance assumes that renewals will continue to perform well in fiscal year '25. Third, the full-year guidance assumes that average contract duration will be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '24 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings.\nFourth, the non-GAAP operating margin guidance assumes incremental prudent investments in sales and marketing and research and development, targeted towards addressing our large market opportunity. Those investments are expected to continue to ramp through the course of the fiscal year.\nFinally, a note on seasonality. Based on our current view of renewal's cohorts and visibility into land and expand, we expect revenue seasonality in fiscal Q3 relative to Q2 to be similar to what we saw in fiscal year '23.\nIn closing, we are pleased that our Q1 performance exceeded the high end of our guidance and would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, investors and stakeholders for their continued trust in us. We remain committed to continued progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth, both through durable top line growth and expanding margins.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Pinjalim Bora, JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora\nRajiv, one for you. Maybe can you talk about what are you hearing from customers around the VMS offering? Trying to understand if this new partnership with AWS. It might act as a catalyst to kind of convince people to move to NC2 or are you seeing any signs of that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nOkay. Pinjalim, Rajiv here. I think you meant VMC on AWS, correct? You said VMS --\nPinjalim Bora\nCorrect. VMC, correct.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nVMC on AWS, correct. Okay. All right. So clearly, I think that seems to be an offering that Broadcom is not focused on as much. And it's created an opportunity for us, for sure, and customers are concerned as to what might happen with their offering.\nFor example, the go cloud version of their offering, garment cloud version was apparently deprecated by Broadcom. So this is one of the impetus for the expanded partnership that we have with AWS, where we are working together with them to provide EVM migration for customers from BMC onto NC2 on AWS. We talked about one of the wins last quarter actually, leading universities that actually went and did exactly that. And anyway. So this is really one of the impetus why AWS is partnering with us.\nThey're offering immigration credit. The migration accelerator program, and we are working together to help customers who might be interested in migrating off that offering on to something else in the public\nPinjalim Bora\nYes. Understood. One for Rukmini. Rukmini, I'm trying to understand the guidance. It seems like a very solid Q1 beat.\nYou took the Q2 numbers up, but the second half seems like it's an implied guide down because you didn't take the full year number up. So I'm trying to understand, is that just prudent caution around what you're seeing on the sales cycles, Were there any deals that mkind of moved from the second half into the first half that changed the seasonality a bit? And lastly, do you think we're close to a trough on NRR?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Pinjalim. Both good questions. I'll start with your revenue guidance first. So yes, we were happy with our Q1 revenue performance, but we are only one quarter into fiscal year. And given the uncertain environment, including that related to a new administration in the US, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year top-line guide until we have a better view of how the rest of the year is going to play out.\nAnd as I noted in my prepared remarks, we continue to see these modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. And we believe that the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions, more approvals and causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in deal structure outcome and timing.\nAnd finally, from a seasonality perspective, we've historically seen a fairly even split in revenue between the first half and second half of the fiscal year. So our current expectations aren't that different from what we've seen historically.\nSo that's on the revenue top-line guidance question, Pinjalim. I think your second part of the question was around NRR. So a few things on NRR. First, I will say that given that our GRR, while we don't disclose it, we've said in the past that it has not changed significantly relative to recent levels. So given that, the largest driver of net new ARR is land and expand ACV, right?\nAnd your question specifically is on which does not, for example, benefit from the strength that we saw in our land. So I want to first start by clarifying that. And we did see some divergence there between sort of the strength in our land performance.\nNow with respect to expand, with existing customers, expand accounts for the majority of our land and expand, which was impacted largely by our US Fed business, which was lower year over year relative to the strong compare we had from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to the CR and the continuing resolutions in the US. And so all the dynamics you talked about in large sales cycle, larger deal sizes, various sales cycles or that does impact expand as well, Pinjalim. So that all did go into the NRR number.\nNow I think your question was around, is this the -- is this -- have we hit sort of the low point for NRR. We don't guide to NRR, as you know. But we do expect that and will be impacted by some of these factors that we've talked about like the sales cycles and the mix of large deals when we expect some of that to continue.\nSo that, we believe is the case, but we don't explicitly guide to NRR.\nOperator\nMeta Marshall, Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall\nGreat. Maybe following up on the federal piece. You noted in the script that you expected kind of fiscal Q2 to be better. I would expect you would need the administration change, so maybe you wouldn't expect kind of federal to improve until fiscal Q3, but just wanted to kind of listen about what went into that commentary or you could explain that more. And then maybe just a second question.\nJust any update on timing of Dell PowerFlex kind of integration? Just anything there would be helpful.\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo Meta, on the federal question, I mean, we don't have visibility in terms of what the new administration is going to do or not do. So we can't really talk about what's going to happen after the new agitation comes in. So we have a near-term view on Q2, of course, which we factored in. And that's why we feel comfortable about our federal business coming back to more normal levels in Q2 based on what we know today. And of course, we'll have to see what the new administration does after they come on board.\nNow on the Dell question, specifically. So as you know, Meta, there's two parts to the Dell relationship. One is the existing hyper-converged solution that we have, which will be an appliance sale by combining our software on their service. That's been in the market now this quarter, and it's still early days for that.\nYour question on PowerFlex. We expect to have that in the market in the first half of calendar '25, and we expect to see some revenue contribution from it in FY26.\nOperator\nJim Fish, Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish\nI did want to build off of Meta's question and Pinjalim there a little bit. Can you just remind us how big this federal vertical can be for you guys here in fiscal Q1 versus kind of what you saw here? And what the actual impact net retention rate was? Like are we talking about a point or two difference that we would have seen versus the 110% or how to kind of quantify that?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nI'll take that, Jim. So First, on quantification of Fed, we don't disclose that, Jim. But as you can imagine and we've said this before, that for our Q1 is typically the seasonally strongest quarter given it's also the federal year-end, which covers September 30. So we don't disclose that number, Jim, but that is Q1 is our strongest Fed quarter. And similarly, right, we're not going to break out NRR impact by Fed or by any other sort of segmentation at this point.\nBut we did see the fact that overall Fed and expand specifically was lower than last year. It was a challenge for us in Q1 relative to what we saw last Q1, which was a strong one to compare.\nJames Fish\nGot it. And Rajiv, maybe for you. I think we're all kind of anxious to hear about when we could see more stand-alone into other storage arrays. Obviously, you just talked about the calendar first half of '25 seeing Dell PowerFlex. But how should we start thinking about Nutanix's relationships of getting stand-alone AHV integration into some of the other providers out there?\nAnd why we wouldn't start to see that AHV attach go from 7% today to faster to 100?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I think those are two different questions there, Jim. I think on the first question, clearly, the only one that we've announced so far has been Dell PowerFlex relationship. As you can imagine, we do have plans to expand that selectively to other storage arrays over time. I'm not going to preannounce anything right now, but you can assume that we are working on that in a very careful way. At the same time, we also want to make sure that whatever we do is actually focusing on expanding the market opportunity for us and doesn't cannibalize the existing HCI opportunity.\nSo we are focused specifically on working with storage array vendors that are workloads that would not necessarily be easier to capture with HCI because the workload we can capture with our own HCI platform, we would like to do that at the full stack.\nAnd over time, even for those that we do go in our goal is to sell the full stack over time. So stay tuned. I mean, we, of course, will continue to explore other options in the market when it comes to other storage arrays. And you can -- we don't have any more to say at this point. But the idea is to start with Dell and then over time expand to others.\nWith respect to your question on AHV penetration. Again, I think our philosophy has always been we support multiple hypervisors. And there's been a natural cadence to buy which the AHV adoption has continued to grow, and we are still at where it is. I don't necessarily need it to be 100%, frankly, but our goal is to increase the AHV footprint because we also want to be able to insert into VMware accounts, where our platform is running on top of ESX, the VMware hypervisor, and we'll continue to support that going forward as well.\nBut we would, of course, like to see more and more customers start to migrate over to our ASV footprint. And having, of course, this third-party storage support will only help amplify that.\nOperator\nJason Ader, William Blair.\nJason Ader\nSo when I look at the second half and you gave basically guidance revenue per quarter for the second half. But then looking at the operating margin for the year, you raised that only slightly after having pretty significant outperformance in Q1 and also guiding to a pretty robust operating margin in Q2. So that implies the second half is going to be kind of weigh down on the operating margin.\nAnd I know you said you're going to be ramping expenses, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing kind of idiosyncratic to the second half that we're not thinking about. And then can you talk about where that ramp up in spending is going to come. You said sales and marketing and R&D, but could you be more specific within those buckets.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nJason, first, on operating margin. So you're correct. So first, I'll start with revenue. What we said was -- I think in response to an earlier question, that our implied revenue split, first half to second half is roughly even based on the -- and that's similar to our historical patterns. While we expect operating expenses on the other hand, to grow over the course of the year, much like it did last fiscal year.\nSo to your point, you're correct that we will expect to see lower operating margins in the second half of the year and fiscal year '25. However, overall, we still expect to see year-over-year improvement in operating margin for the full fiscal year relative to fiscal year '24. And then to the second part of your question on where are we spending those dollars.\nSo first, in R&D, we have talked about investing, for example, in these AHV standalone to support the stand-alone storage arrays. So that's one area of R&D investment. Some other examples include we have ramped up our offerings around cloud native or containerized applications. That's another area generative AI plus our core enterprise platform, right, to the platform and making sure that it continues to evolve. So even within our core platforms, there are innovations that we continue to drive.\nSo that's on the R&D side, some examples of where we're investing.\nOn the sales and marketing side, we have talked about some investments we've made -- some we made last year and some will continue into this year, for example, around product specialist sellers, folks who are focused on selling our entire portfolio and helping our main field sellers go do that. We have increased some investments around the channel as another example, some inside sales folks who can be focused on driving both expansion and land around the more mid-market tiers. So those are some examples of areas that we're investing in both sales and marketing and in R&D.\nOperator\nWamsi Mohan, Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nIt's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Rukmini, the renewals business has been strong. How should we think about the growth in available to renew pool in fiscal '25 versus fiscal '24? And is there any danger that renewals kind of fall off a cliff in fiscal '26? Or is there a large enough cohort of customers who are going to renew in fiscal '26 that strong growth in renewals continues and it grows as a mix of the business.\nSo just your thoughts on available to renew pool and how you see that business continuing to grow?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. So you're correct that we did talk about renewals doing well for Q1. In terms of ATR for full year fiscal year '25, I think we referred to this in our last earnings call when we gave you all the initial guide for fiscal year '25. Available to the new pool or ATR is expected to grow nicely in '25 year over year versus '24, and we'll continue to grow quite nicely over the next few years, Ruplu. So I'm not going to give you a quantification for fiscal year '26 at this point.\nWe're still only one quarter into '25. But yes, we expect that growth in available to renew for our renewal cohorts to continue for the next couple of years.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nOkay. And maybe for my follow-up, I'll ask you another question. Free cash flow in fiscal 1Q was very strong. It was $152 million, which I don't think, over the last three, four years, you've had such a strong 1Q. Were there any one-time items?\nI know last quarter, you had said that you might get from a partner, I think you had said $30 million benefit for the full year in terms of free cash flow. So any guidance on how we should think about the progression of free cash flow first half versus second half in this year?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ruplu. We were happy with our free cash flow performance in Q1, as you alluded to. So nothing significant, I would call out as onetime. So you're right, those partner payments, we did call out for fiscal year '25 and those will continue to come in. They might be a little inconsistent in terms of quarter to quarter, but we're not breaking that out quarterly, Ruplu.\nThere wasn't any one thing I would call out. For example, in Q4, in our July quarter, we did call out there was one significant deal that we collected in that quarter. For example, there was nothing like that, that I would call out for Q1. And more generally, I think when you think about just, I think rest of the year, part of your question is $152 million was a strong Q1, and our full-year guide is $560 million to $610 million. And so I'll just remind you that, one, expenses are going up, expected to go up through the rest of the year.\nSo keep that in mind, right, those expenses will ramp over the course of the year, much like they did last fiscal year. So that in. And we do collect multiple years of cash from our customers typically upfront. And so that does mean that depending on duration or depending on some larger deals, there can be some variation quarter to quarter in that number, which is why we continue to guide for free cash flow really on an annual basis only.\nOperator\nMike Cikos, Needham.\nMichael Cikos\nI'm going to ask a boring one on guidance and build on some of the line of questioning that Mr. Rader was going after on the operating margin and the operating profit. But I just wanted to get a better understanding congratulations on the 20% operating margin we're seeing here in Q1.\nIs the view for full year in any way informed like are we potentially behind on hiring versus where we expected to be exiting Q1? Or are you potentially increasing your view of additional investments in sales and marketing and R&D? Because I know that's something that we had flagged on the previous quarter. Just wanted to wrestle those two items.\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Mike. Always welcome the boring question on the guide. So thank you for that. Not at all boring, actually. It's very, very practical.\nSo when we think of spend and our planning cycles, Mike. So we're coming out of our planning cycle. And so as we deploy this, again, similar to last fiscal year, some of this will be ramping over the course of the year. So that is in the plan. And so you'll continue to see that this year relative to last year, right?\nSo there's nothing unusual or different necessarily that I would call out other than, of course, as we hire people in Q1 or Q2, they might be there for partially for that quarter. But then for the next quarter, they're there for the full quarter, right? So there is that almost normalization that happened over the course of the year. And so that's what's baked into the op margin guide for the full year relative to what you saw in Q1.\nMichael Cikos\nGot it. And then just one other, if I could. I know that we're -- and I appreciate the commentary here as well as far as the Q2 versus 3Q seasonality on revenue. I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about this properly, even if I go back beyond last year, two years ago, we tend to see coal at a 7% to 8%, 7% feels about right as far as a sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3. And I appreciate your qualitative comments, but if you could further elaborate on that.\nWhat is driving that seasonal component? Is it really tied to year-end in Q2 and then maybe the sales incentive comp for your sales force in Q4? Is that why we should be thinking about that Q2 to Q3 sequential movements that we're talking to?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nYou're exactly right, Mike. So historically, if you look at our performance, Q2 and Q4 tend to be seasonally stronger quarters from a top line perspective, exactly for the recency outline because Q2 has the December year-end. And Q4 had our end of fiscal year, and therefore, some sales incentives tied to a strong finish there. What has happened also is as we now have the renewal cohorts layering in, they tend to follow similarly the land expand performance in the past because they're just reflective of deals that were signed and when those renewals view.\nSo now we have the impact of historical land and expand, but the renewal cohorts are also following that pattern. So we just wanted to remind folks of that going into Q3 and give you a sense of qualitatively, what to expect relative to the Q2 guidance.\nOperator\nBen Bollin, Cleveland Research Company.\nBen Bollin\nRajiv, I wanted to get your perspective a bigger picture on enterprise refresh behavior, in particular, around how you see customers evolving around three-tier versus HCI? Any thoughts on the pace and rate of enterprise on-prem AI deployments?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes, I'll take those two questions separately. I don't think Ben that much has changed with respect to three-tier versus HCI. We still continue to validate the proposition of 40% -- 40% to 50% lower TCO if you replace your three-tier with SCI and it also provides you the platform to really expand into becoming a hybrid cloud, which is what companies want. And so over time, I do expect to continue to see HCI gain into the legacy three-tier offering. So that part hasn't really changed.\nThe dynamics really haven't changed. Of course, it's usually tied to a hardware refresh cycle because that's when you refresh your storage arrays. And instead of refreshing storage here is what we tell customers when they just buy simple servers and put HCI on it. So no change really on that front.\nOn enterprise AI, what we see again is that the bulk of the spend so far have been not really in the enterprise, but in these large hyperscalers as they build out these massive clusters to train these large language models with huge investments from a small handful of very large providers. So we see that for sure.\nNow within the enterprise, most enterprises are, I would say, in the early stages of deploying Generative AI, largely for RAG relative long into generation and fine-tuning and inferencing. They're not going to train these models. They're going to use models that are pre-existing and then use them to drive inferencing but more cost-effective, smaller clusters. We think that, that segment of the market is in early stages. We have seen the first set of applications come about.\nEven this quarter, as you know, we talked about this government customer in EMEA that's starting to use our GPT 2.0 offering. I would say most enterprises are in the early stages of adoption, including ourselves, where we're targeting to see things like a 25% productivity gain for our developers, our improvements in how we manage legal contracts. So companies looking at fraud detection. These are the kind of use cases that we're starting to see emerge. But I would say it's in the early days.\nMost enterprises are only now getting into the act of trying to build these applications. And I do think that this space is going to continue to grow over the next few years, but it's still largely incubation at this point in the enterprise.\nBen Bollin\nThat's great. And Rukmini, if I could. In the past, you had provided some perspective on the growth of $1 million-plus deals in your pipeline relative to the remainder of the business. Curious if you have any updates on that metric exiting the quarter?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nThank you, Ben. I will say we are continuing to see nice growth in our pipeline, including for the larger deals that we've talked about before, Ben, we're not updating those metrics specifically on a quarterly basis. But yes, we are seeing continued interest and engagement and growth in pipeline from those $1 million-plus sort of cohorts and more generally.\nOperator\nSimon Leopold, Raymond James.\nVictor Chiu\nThis is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to drill into your commentary around the increased customer engagement from VMware Basin. Maybe help us understand if this was an incremental acceleration relative to what you were previously observing? If so, maybe help us understand what's driving that and if you expect that to continue?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nSo, Victor, the market continues to be dynamic. But from our perspective, it's still largely unchanged in terms of our opportunity, a multiyear opportunity to gain share. So we haven't seen a significant change in that this quarter compared to the last several quarters really. And we haven't seen any real meaningful changes in our win-loss rate size around these opportunities. I'll say what we've already said before, right, a lot of these deals are tied to VMware customers, their ELA renewal cycles.\nThey try to when the installed base is coming up for a hardware refresh, although we are also expanding our ability to capture -- to have our solutions work on existing hardware like, for example, the three-tier work that we're doing with Dell or like continuing to be able to deploy our software on already existing BMS HCI customers. And of course, it's a dynamic market in the sense that sometimes we see aggressive behavior from Broadcom as well to keep those customers especially the very large ones. So really, I would say, net-net, nothing much has changed.\nVictor Chiu\nOkay. And if the organization decides that they wanted to move away from VMware kind of, on average, how long is that transition typically? And kind of what are the steps involved that required for a customer to do something like that?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nCorrect. It depends on the scale and complexity of their deployment. So if they are -- for example, I'll give you the two bookends. So on the small -- on the easy side, if they are just largely the say, vSphere customer and they're willing to replace their hardware. It's a very easy migration.\nWe can migrate that within a month or two off a relatively small scale. A lot of that is automated as well. Same goes for public cloud to public cloud. And there was a question earlier about VMS Cloud on AWS. Those offerings are actually very easy to migrate.\nAgain, this in a month, we can have those customers off and on to a tan offer. But at the other end of the spectrum are these large customers that use multiple VMware products with massive estates. And there, it can be many years. It can be three years to do a migration. Just because they can't migrate all of it at once, there is a requirement for a professional services engagement to convert over some of their more complex custom scripts, they have return on customer investments they've made on top of the VMS portfolio.\nSo those migrations tend to be complex, require professional services and take a few years. So there's an entire spectrum across those.\nVictor Chiu\nDo you have maybe kind of a general ballpark kind of estimation of what percentage is the easy kind of low-hanging fruit? And what --?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I would say if you look at -- with the exception of, I think, if you go to a large Tier 1 big global accounts, those are the ones that are difficult, right? The vast majority of the smaller customers are going to be more on the easy side.\nOperator\nMatt Hedberg, RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg\nI just wanted to ask, obviously, it sounds like the federal business had some headwinds. Maybe just a simple question, but Rajiv, did the enterprise business, do you think it deteriorated from a demand perspective versus last quarter? Just because it seems like good revolve, but just trying to get a kind of finer point on sort of like your thought on enterprise spending today versus maybe many days ago?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. Matt, clearly, we saw the softness in Fed for sure. We saw it -- that was a very clear cut. The broader enterprise, I we've actually, again, been doing quite well at landing new logos and people migrating. But of course, some of that is perhaps due to just what's happening with the Broadcom situation.\nSo we haven't seen a decline in enterprise spend or less willingness to spend. What we have seen, and we've been talking about this in multiple quarters, Matt, is lot more inspection going on the Fed and a lot more approvals being required higher in the food chain, looking at TCO more carefully, which, of course, plays to our benefit in some articles what we talk about in this environment is how we can reduce TCO.\nSo that dynamic has been going on now for several quarters. We haven't seen much of a change. So net-net, I have to say it for the broader enterprise demand, we haven't seen a change this quarter compared to the prior quarters.\nMatthew Hedberg\nGot it. That's very clear. And then maybe another sort of, I guess, macro question for Rukmini. Obviously, it's not your year-end, but do you typically see a December budget flush from an enterprise percent? I can't imagine you're baking that into guidance.\nJust kind of curious on historically, do you see customers kind of spend it or lose it mentality when it comes to December, your calendar year end?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nI mean certainly, sometimes, right? I mean they may have a budget that's available for this year. We've seen that in the past. We probably will see some of that this year as well, right? I mean I think they do have -- I mean, if your company is on that calendar cycle, yes, you probably will have some budget to spend -- but again, I would not say we factor whatever we can see into our guide for Q2.\nSo nothing really different this year compared to prior years. And so typically, we see a seasonal increase in Q2 compared to Q1. And that's driven in part by the fact that what you alluded to, Matt, but people spending at the end of the year.\nOperator\nGeorge Wang, Barclays.\nI just had two quick ones. Firstly, can you kind of double-click in terms of the channel incentives in place kind of what has changed versus three months ago in terms of providing the promo and the incentives to the channel, especially at the backdrop of for maybe overlapping Nutanix or VMware contract?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean this is a few months ago that we made the change, no recent changes, by the way, on the channel side. We made that going a while ago. But what we did, we did a couple of things there, Joe. First thing we did was we took a subset of our customer base, our target prospects and handed them off entirely to the channel to go drive.\nAnd so we don't have our reps on those accounts. We leave it to the channel, and we provided more incentives to those channel partners to bring us business. So we have incentives in place for our channel partners to bring new logos to us in terms of rewards that they will get more rewards when they bring new logos to us. We are also committed to the channel in the sense that all our deals go through the channel partners. So we're not trying to work around them or shut them out of any of the deals.\nAnd so we've seen, certainly, as a result of all of that, a significant increase in channel partner engagement with us over the last year or two. Some of it is, of course, just what they're seeing with Broadcom, more child partners coming to us, some of it is our own incentives that we are offering for them.\nAnd we also have incentives for the end customer as well, right? So for example, to help them tide over migrations, we can offer them free licenses for a period of time to help them while they're still spending money on VMware to get going on our products until they're ready to go migrate fully over.\nOkay. Just a follow-up, if I can. Just in terms of repatriation, just as kind of a theme, which benefits on Nutanix. Just curious if anything has changed on the repenetration, any additional data points versus last quarter?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. In terms of cloud repatriation, I would say we haven't seen like a massive repatriation of workloads coming back from the public cloud. We see some of that here and there, right? That's where I would characterize it not has changed compared to past quarter. But I think what we see is, again, I can see there is people are much more careful about what they go put in the cloud.\nSo keep in mind that the vast majority of enterprise workloads are still on-prem, not in the public cloud. And now CIOs are being more circumspect about what to use the public cloud for. For example, there's a realization that if we have steady-state workloads, those workloads can be run more efficiently on-prem than in the public cloud. And so this CIO of therefore saying, well, I'm going to keep that workload on-prem. I'm not going to move that to the public cloud.\nSo that's what we are seeing.\nOperator\nNehal Chokshi, Northland Capital Markets.\nNehal Chokshi\nCongrats on the really strong new logo up to 2% year-over-year. That's really impressive. I'm trying to put though, why is ARR decelerating given the strong land that you're seeing? And then if I look at the incremental ARR, i.e., the change quarter-over-quarter or October quarter, relative to the year ago quarter, that was down a lot as well. So thoughts on why are there such a weak incremental ARR characteristics, especially given the backdrop that you're having such strong WAN metrics?\nRukmini Sivaraman\nNehal, thank you. So a few things to -- I'll start with on your point about net new ARR. So One of the biggest drivers of net new ARR, which is simply, as you pointed out, the difference between ARR in this quarter versus the prior quarter is land and expand ACV. And given that our GRR has not changed significantly relative to recent historical levels. And so when you think about land and expand, we did see some divergence, as you point out in the performance of the land versus the expand portion of our business.\nSo we saw strength in the new customers. And we've talked about why that is. And so really happy with that performance.\nExpansion with existing customers, which actually accounts for the majority of the land and expand was impacted largely by our US federal business, Nihal, and we've talked about why we believe that will be the case. And so -- and overall, by the way, right, we've talked about these larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline which are taking longer to close and have data variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. So all of those factors also do impact our ARR growth. So that's how to think about just ARR and net new ARR.\nOperator\nMichael, Wells Fargo.\nI'll ask one on behalf of Aaron. I just want to ask about GPT 2.0 or GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution. I'm just curious, as you think about, I guess, the positioning of that in the marketplace relative to kind of a full stack or a three-tier architecture with NVIDIA's AI enterprise software suite. How do these differ in terms of where they sit in the market that I guess do you see opportunity to maybe move up market as these solutions mature going forward?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. I mean some of that is also a difference between training and inferencing. We are largely with GPT-in-a-Box focused on influencing, focusing on smaller clusters, not massive compute funds to our trade models. Smaller clusters that enterprises can use to deploy more cost-effective AI inferencing applications. I'll give you one example.\nWe, for example, one of our first use cases in Nutanix internally, was a customer service use case where incoming service request from a customer support ticket, the support engineer actually has a natural language into search interface through which they enter the query and then we look through all-on-one basis to try and accelerate our -- the ability to answer that issue. And that AI application is running on just a small cluster, okay, leaving an open source large language model.\nAnd that's the kind of upstarting on GPT-in-a-Box internally. And that's the kind of use case that we're enabling for the enterprise, where you have your secure data, you want to do your inferencing on it, using existing models that are already pretrained, but fine-tuned with your use cases. So that's a cost-optimized solution.\nAnd by the way, we are partnered with NVIDIA on that because we work with the immediate inferencing solution as well as, of course, using their GPUs to do all the hard work needed here. So again, I just think we want to distinguish between influencing on small clusters, which is mostly what we do versus training of very large clusters.\nThat's helpful. And if I can sneak one more in. Just as we think about an improving sort of traditional server end demand environment and as we think about refresh cycles. Obviously, that presents an insertion opportunity for you guys within three-tier architecture. So I'm curious with the new partnerships with Dell and Cisco.\nHave you seen your win rates at all changing? Or do you anticipate those improving given your kind of broader ability to enter those deals?\nRajiv Ramaswami\nYes. First of all, I think I think Cisco and Dell selling our products is, of course, positive for us. And Cisco has been a good contributor to our new logos this quarter as well as last quarter. That is still, I think, very early days for us. And that's independent of the server refresh cycle or not, right?\nSecond, I would say, with respect to refresh cycles, yes, server refreshes will help, but also storage of freshers are important, right? Because that's when we get the opportunity to displace those three-tier architectures with HCI footprint. So both matter. I think having Dell and Cisco as friends in the market, of course, significantly helps. And at the same time, the refresh cycles -- more so, I would say storage or fresh and server refresh will help us insert HCI into existing deployments.\nOperator\nThank you, and thanks for participating. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect.\nView Comments"

So on that note, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for ServiceNow:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.11 = US$1.3b \u00f7 (US$18b - US$6.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\nTherefore, ServiceNow has an ROCE of 11%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 9.1% generated by the Software industry.\nCheck out our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nNYSE:NOW Return on Capital Employed December 3rd 2024\nIn the above chart we have measured ServiceNow's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.56%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.42%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.83%.\nThe the stock of maker of software that automates companies' technology operations has risen by 11.62% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.44% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.11%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of ServiceNow in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $3.60, indicating a 15.76% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.96 billion, up 21.28% from the prior-year quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.87 per share and revenue of $10.97 billion. These totals would mark changes of +28.66% and +22.33%, respectively, from last year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for ServiceNow should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. At present, ServiceNow boasts a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nInvestors should also note ServiceNow's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 75.09. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 30.22 for its industry.\nWe can also see that NOW currently has a PEG ratio of 3.05. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Computers - IT Services industry stood at 2.82 at the close of the market yesterday.\nStory Continues\nThe Computers - IT Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 39, which puts it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

(NYSE:NOW) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$4.16b\nUS$5.10b\nUS$5.77b\nUS$6.93b\nUS$7.78b\nUS$8.51b\nUS$9.14b\nUS$9.68b\nUS$10.2b\nUS$10.6b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x24\nAnalyst x16\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 12.25%\nEst @ 9.36%\nEst @ 7.34%\nEst @ 5.92%\nEst @ 4.93%\nEst @ 4.24%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%\nUS$3.9k\nUS$4.5k\nUS$4.7k\nUS$5.3k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\nStory Continues\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$11b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$253b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$253b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$130b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$182b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$1.0k, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNYSE:NOW Discounted Cash Flow November 29th 2024\nImportant Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ServiceNow as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.042. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for ServiceNow\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nMoving On:\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +9.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share, indicating a change of +15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)\nWhat a fantastic six months it\u2019s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is NOW a Good Business?\nFounded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.\n1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nServiceNow\u2019s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters,\u00a0its year-on-year growth averaged\u00a024.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nSell-side analysts expect ServiceNow\u2019s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nServiceNow\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate\nServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\nStory Continues\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on ServiceNow, and with the recent rally, the stock trades at 17.6x forward price-to-sales (or $1,055 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than ServiceNow\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we\u2019re here to help you pick them.\nGet started by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like United Rentals (+550% five-year return).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

One such country in the picture that\u2019s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race.

McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do \"everything they can to lock their digital doors\" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\"While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies.

For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nWhat's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?\nServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow\u2019s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nCan we expect growth from ServiceNow?\nNYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nIf you'd like to know more about ServiceNow as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

While many are still bullish on further upside in the stock, we believe it's time to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the profits.\nServiceNow specializes in digital workflow automation, providing cloud-based workflow automation solutions that help organizations improve their operations. Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.\nThe company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.\nHard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage\nThe rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.\nApproximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.\nSome of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.\nOur bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft\u2019s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.\nCarahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn\u2019t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company\u2019s future relations with the government.\nIn a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.\nThis also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn\u2019t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock\u2019s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow ranks 24th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 97 hedge fund portfolios held NOW at the end of the second quarter which was 90 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, ServiceNow has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\nPerformance of an Industry Player\nServiceNow belongs to the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.\nIn recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.\n\"We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously\u201d\nHelberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.\nREAD NEXT: 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now and 10 AI News Investors Can\u2019t Afford to Miss\nThis news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a \u201cwall\u201d. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI\u2019s Orion is \u201cso far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI\u2019s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.\u201d\nHowever, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is \u201cno wall\u201d. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it\u2019s possible to have reached a turning point.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we\u2019ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.\u201d\nGary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:\n\u201cThe economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense\u2026\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?
