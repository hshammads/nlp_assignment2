Commercial nuclear reactors generate about 1 gigawatt of electricity, enough for 750,000 typical homes.\nMeta is racing to line up clean energy to meet the massive electricity needs of its artificial intelligence ambitions. Like fellow tech giants Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc., it\u2019s now pursuing a tantalizing but hard-to-develop energy source \u2014 nuclear power. Reactors offer the promise of clean energy around the clock, but electric utilities have shown little interest in building them, due to their high cost and long construction timelines. Deep-pocketed technology companies may be able to accelerate development of the next wave of nuclear plants.\n\u201cThey are willing to take on a little more of the early financial risk,\u201d said Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute research organization. \u201cUtility companies are not keeping pace with technology companies\u2019 needs.\u201d\nMeta said it would consider both large, conventional reactors and small modular designs, a new approach that may be faster and cheaper to deploy but remains untested.\nThe announcement follows recent announcements from Alphabet and Amazon to invest in companies developing advanced reactor technologies. And Microsoft Corp. has agreed to buy power from a reactor that Constellation Energy Corp. plans to restart at the Three Mile Island site in Pennsylvania.\nWhile there\u2019s almost no nuclear construction activity now in the US, Stein said Meta\u2019s goal to have power in the next decade is feasible.\n\u201cThere are definitely some candidates that may be ready by the early 2030s,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they get started very soon.\u201d\n(Updates with comment from analyst and more details, starting in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nElon Musk\u2019s Least Favorite Judge Strikes Again\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Tesla (TSLA)\u2014three stalwarts of the modern market\u2014have not only been leaders this year but also appear poised to continue their outperformance. Strong earnings growth forecasts, top Zacks Ranks, and compelling technical setups are bolstering their bullish outlook.\nBelow, we explore why these three Magnificent Seven members stand out and why they could be smart buys for investors seeking both growth and momentum.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta Platforms (META): Fair Valuation and Momentum Breakout\nMeta Platforms has been a market darling this year, thanks to its relentless focus on profitability and innovation. Following a period of heavy investment in its metaverse initiatives, Meta has shifted gears toward efficiency, and investors have rewarded the pivot with confidence in the stock.\nWhy Meta Looks Compelling Now:\nValuation: Despite its significant run-up, Meta remains attractively valued compared to its tech peers. Today, it is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 26.1x, a reasonable multiple for such a fast growing and profitable company.\nEarnings Growth: Meta boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), underpinned by strong earnings growth forecasts. Analysts project continued revenue and profit expansion with earnings expected to climb at an impressive 20% annually over the next three to five years.\nTechnical Setup: From a charting perspective, Meta is in the midst of a major technical breakout. After consolidating for several weeks it is breaking out today.\nInvestors seeking a combination of growth and value should strongly consider Meta, particularly as pushes new all-time highs.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nAmazon (AMZN): AWS Reacceleration Ignites Growth\nAmazon has reclaimed its status as a market leader, benefiting from an improving macro environment and the reacceleration of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment. Despite its size, Amazon has demonstrated remarkable flexibility in adapting to changing consumer and business needs, allowing it to maintain its dominance across e-commerce and cloud computing.\nKey Catalysts for Amazon:\nValuation: Amazon remains historically cheap relative to its growth potential. Today, Amazon trades at a one year forward earnings multiple of 40x, which is near the most reasonable valuation in the company\u2019s history.\nEarnings Momentum: With a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Amazon is seeing upward revisions to earnings forecasts as analysts anticipate strong performance in cloud computing and ongoing efficiency gains in e-commerce. EPS are forecast to grow 28.9% annually, the highest projection among the Mag 7 stocks.\nTechnical Strength: Amazon\u2019s stock price is approaching record highs, fueled by a powerful uptrend. A breakout above these levels could trigger further buying as investors pile in.\nStory Continues\nFor long-term investors, Amazon\u2019s blend of robust fundamentals and improving technical momentum makes it a must-watch candidate for portfolios focused on mega-cap growth.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nTesla (TSLA): Epic Rally in Progress\nTesla\u2019s stock has been a force of nature in 2024, surging alongside Elon Musk\u2019s ever-expanding influence. Known for its cyclical trading patterns\u2014alternating between massive rallies and sharp corrections\u2014Tesla is currently in the midst of one of its epic bullish phases.\nWhy Tesla Stands Out:\nLeadership and Vision: Tesla\u2019s position as a leader in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy solutions continues to drive investor enthusiasm. Elon Musk\u2019s outsized presence in the tech and business world has only amplified Tesla\u2019s ability to command attention and capital.\nMomentum: Tesla holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and exhibits tremendous price momentum. Analysts expect continued earnings growth as the company benefits from economies of scale and the increasing adoption of EVs globally.\nTechnical Indicators: Tesla is forming a bull flag continuation pattern, which is a textbook bullish setup. If the stock breaks out of this consolidation, it could retest its 2022 record highs, presenting significant upside potential.\nTesla\u2019s ability to maintain a cult following, combined with its explosive trading patterns, makes it a prime candidate for investors willing to ride the wave of its current rally.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShould Investors Buy Shares in TSLA, AMZN, and META?\nFor growth-oriented investors, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla represent some of the most compelling opportunities among the Magnificent Seven and in today\u2019s market. Each company is backed by strong earnings forecasts, attractive valuations, and bullish technical setups.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Behind them, a plane flies towards Big Ben.\n\u2018Maximum protection\u2019 to free expression\nAll three images were reported to Facebook but initially left online by its automated software. The tech giant has since removed the first post, but argued the second and third images did not violate its hate speech rules.\nThe oversight board, whose members include Alan Rusbridger, former Guardian editor, said Meta had argued it had erred in favour of offering \u201cmaximum protection\u201d to free expression.\nThe watchdog, which was set up by Mark Zuckerberg in 2020, is able to offer policy recommendations to Meta, although these are not binding.\nThe board said it planned to investigate the \u201cpreparedness and crisis response to violent riots targeting migrant and Muslim communities\u201d. It would also examine the \u201crole social media played in the 2024 UK riots, including the spread of misinformation, in organising riots and informing the public of relevant developments\u201d.\nAnti-immigrant rioting broke out across the UK after three girls were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport this summer.\nRioters attacked Muslim businesses and hotels holding asylum seekers.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has charged 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time of the incident, with the killings as well as a terror charge for alleged possession of a military study of an Al-Qaeda training manual and a charge under the Biological Weapons Act. He is due to go on trial next year and has not entered a plea.\nThe knife attack itself has not been judged a terrorist incident by police.\nDozens of arrests for racists posts\nIn the wake of the knife attack, far-Right groups used social media to organise violent protests.\nThere have since been dozens of arrests of people who shared racist posts or called for violence against Muslims. In August, a woman was jailed for 15 months for writing a post urging people to \u201cblow up the mosques\u201d.\nStory continues\nMPs have tried to summon Elon Musk to account for the role of X in the spreading of disinformation during the riots. Mr Musk claimed in a post on X to his 200m followers that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d in the UK, prompting condemnation from Sir Keir Starmer.\nChi Owurah, chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, said last month: \u201cThe violence we saw on UK streets this summer has shown the dangerous real-world impact of spreading misinformation and disinformation across social media.\u201d\nA Facebook spokesman said: \u201cDuring the UK riots we activated our crisis policy protocol \u2013 which we developed in response to a prior recommendation from the oversight board \u2013 and deployed dedicated teams to remove violating content and engage directly with local authorities.\n\u201cWe welcome the oversight board\u2019s guidance in these cases and will implement their decisions once they have finished deliberating.\u201d"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks.\nKen Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors.\nFisher said, \"I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused.\"\nBesides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors.\nIn the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips.\nREAD ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams\u2019 Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks.\nEven though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better.\n\"Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly,\" Ken Fisher said.\nKen Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the \"magnificent seven\" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions.\nStory Continues\n\"If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward\", Fisher said in a video interview.\nOur Methodology\nWe looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm's stake at the end of Q3 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nFisher Asset Management\u2019s Equity Stake: $3.76 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes: 235\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a communication service company that develops products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family. As the owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, the company generates 98% of its revenues from digital advertising. Likewise, the company's core digital advertising business is booming amid a resilient economy on lower interest rates.\nOn October 30, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its third-quarter results. The company made $40.59 billion in revenue, up 19% from last year. Its operating margin increased to 43%. User engagement grew, with 3.29 billion daily active users across its apps, a 5% rise. The average ad price also went up by 11%.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is putting more money into generative AI with its large language model, Llama. This is part of their plan to make their apps more engaging. More engagement means more advertisers, which leads to more ad revenue. Analysts expect Meta's earnings to grow at an annual rate of 25% and revenue by 16% from 2023 to 2026. The growth will come from their apps, which have 3.29 billion daily users, and new augmented and virtual reality products.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 12th on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

It could further help improve internet connectivity to some unserved and underserved communities. It is believed to form a W beginning with the East Coast of the United States, South to Cape Town in Africa, to Mumbai and Chennai in India, Darwen in Australia, and then up the West Coast of the United States. According to sources, it could become operational by 2025. However, some say there could be a delay for some reasons, including high demand for cable laying ships given that they are already booking up as far as the middle of the next decade.\nThis ambitious project complements others like Google, which have engaged in subsea cable investment to boost service provision and respond to connectivity issues. Just as Meta seeks to reinforce its worldwide connections, its multi-billion-dollar gamble on subsea pipelines might alter the world's digital infrastructure, but it still exposes the company to the risk of cost escalation or excessive regulation.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

The stock has surged a remarkable 189% year-to-date, reflecting the company\u2019s significant role in the AI industry and strong financial performance throughout the year.\nIts Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), initially used for the video games market, now rake in significant revenue from AI customers.

Yet because these personal devices are used for work, the tech company, which has made privacy a key part of its messaging, allegedly claims broad permissions to \u201caccess, search, and use all of its employees\u2019 data\u2014including their personal data,\u201d on the personal devices, according to a press release.\nApart from it being impractical to carry around two phones, even if employees were to choose to use a phone issued by the company, the Apple-owned device would still record the employees\u2019 location, among other personal details, the lawsuit claims.\nEmployees who use their personal devices for work often use their personal iCloud accounts because Apple allows only one iCloud account per device. Apple can then use the iCloud account on a personal device that an employee uses for work to access their personal data and that of any devices synced to that iCloud account, which could include devices owned by an employee\u2019s family, the lawsuit alleges.\nApple also requires employees to agree it \u201ccan engage in physical, video, and electronic surveillance of them,\u201d and that it can search an employee\u2019s Apple and non-Apple devices while they are on \u201ccompany premises,\u201d which according to one Apple policy, can include their home offices, according to the lawsuit.\n\u201cFor Apple\u2019s employees, the Apple ecosystem is not a walled garden. It is a prison yard. A panopticon where employees, both on and off duty, are ever subject to Apple\u2019s all-seeing eye,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that through its employee policies, Apple prevents employees from discussing \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201ctraining\u201d against California law and prevents them from accepting speaking engagements that relate to Apple\u2019s business without company approval. Because of this policy, Bhakta was not allowed to accept speaking engagements on digital advertising, which harmed his job prospects, the lawsuit claims. It also made him edit his LinkedIn to remove some information about his position at Apple.\nStory Continues\nThe lawsuit also alleges that under its equity plans and agreements, Apple illegally claims the right to claw back vested stock that an employee has earned if they disclose any confidential information or breach an agreement with the company.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that Apple, whose ethos is privacy and confidentiality, would try to monitor and censor me,\u201d said Bhakta in a press release. \u201cThat hurts my ability to advance professionally. I hope this complaint causes Apple to change their approach to monitoring employees outside of work and reminds employees that they have the power to stand up too.\u201d\nApple did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment. In a statement to Semafor, an Apple spokesperson said the company disagreed with the claims in the lawsuit and added, \u201cEvery employee has the right to discuss their wages, hours, and working conditions, and this is part of our business conduct policy, which all employees are trained on annually.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

The latest country to embrace it is Japan. According to\u00a0The Japan Times,\u00a0private-sector businesses in the country have begun embracing related information technologies to enhance operational efficiency. GenAI search services, in particular, are proving\u00a0useful for searching corporate databases.\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI News Updates This Weekend\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nThe news states how Lion, a leading Japanese consumer goods company, has built a generative AI-powered search system that allows its researchers to search through research reports and conference materials stored in the company\u2019s database efficiently.\n\u201cTo drive innovation, we need a system that allows researchers to have quick access to technical knowledge when they need it\u201d.\nYamaoka revealed that the time required to locate a desired document has been reduced to an average of one-fifth of that with conventional search systems. The company further states that GenAI is proving beneficial not only for recruits and young employees but also for those transitioning to new workplaces, allowing them to \u201csystematically acquire knowledge in unfamiliar fields\u201d. Even though GenAI comes with its fair share of challenges such as hallucinations and copyright concerns, it also stands to benefit the corporate world in the long run.\nIn other news, one popular AI chatbot is seemingly facing a technical glitch and preventing it from saying one name in particular: David Mayer. If there is one name in the AI realm that everyone knows about, it\u2019s ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence chatbot has been trained on large amounts of data to create content, including voices, music, pictures, and videos. However, it was recently unearthed by a Reddit user that the AI chatbot is unable to say David Mayer.\nAccording to AI expert Justine Moore, a plausible scenario is that someone named David Mayer went out of his way to remove his presence from the internet. For example, strict privacy laws in the European Union allow citizens to file \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nApple (AAPL)'s AI Ambitions: Loop's 'Buy' Rating and the Future of Apple Intelligence\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has gained popularity in the AI investment theme after the launch of Apple Intelligence, its AI-driven personal system. \u00a0On December 2nd, Loop reiterated Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a \u201cBuy\u201d and said that it believes Apple has the opportunity to become the go-to choice for users to use and access generative AI, similar to how the company became essential for social media with the iPhone and digital content with the iPod.\n\u201cOur thesis is that AAPL has an opportunity the next few years to solidify itself as consumer\u2019s Gen AI \u2018base camp\u2019 of choice, just as it did for social media 15 years ago (with iPhone) and digital content consumption 20 years ago (with iPod)\u201d.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of AI news investors shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $256.\nThe analyst cited the multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flows as factors for rating reiteration.\nThe analyst writes that, as per SensorTower data, App Store revenues in first-quarter FY25 (after 64 days) rose to $5.6 billion, a 15.2% year-over-year increase. Total downloads (iPhone and iPad) grew by 7.4% year-over-year, reaching 6.1 billion.\nIn November, global App Store revenue increased by 15.8% year-over-year, with China showing a 9.0% year-over-year growth, adds the analyst.\nMohan writes that App store dollars per download also rose by 7.3% year-over-year.\nEntertainment app revenue grew 35% year-over-year after 64 days and Gaming revenue increased 5% to $2.7 billion. Games remain the largest segment, followed by Entertainment (16%) and other categories, adds the analyst.\nMohan says this highlights a shift toward more diverse revenue streams as non-gaming apps monetize more. The impact of the new Apple Intelligence on download and revenue trends will be closely monitored.\nThe analyst projects total services revenue growth of 13% year-over-year for both first-quarter and second-quarter of FY25 and sees the resilience in services as a long-term positive indicator.\nMohan writes that 270 days after Apple\u2019s compliance deadline, there has been minimal impact on web browser downloads in the EU.\nThe iPhone company reported\u00a0fiscal\u00a0fourth-quarter\u00a0revenue\u00a0of\u00a0$94.9 billion, topping analyst estimates of\u00a0$94.56 billion.

Over the past three months, Apple's shares have appreciated 7.32%; they closed at $239.07. With a forward price-to----earning ratio of 32.26 above historical averages, analysts have raised questions about the valuation of the stock. The present price of the company also exceeds the GuruFocus Value estimate of $187.95, so indicating a possible premium valuation that investors should be wary of. The complaint adds to Apple's already intense regulatory scrutiny directed on its App Store policies internationally.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

You invest here and create jobs.\u201d\nIf confirmed, that would be a tenfold increase from Apple\u2019s last offer of $100 million. Its initial bid was an even smaller $10 million for a factory making accessories and components in the city of Bandung just outside of the capital Jakarta, Bloomberg News earlier reported. Representatives for Apple didn\u2019t immediately reply to emails seeking comment outside of regular office hours.\nIndonesia prohibited the sale of Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone 16 devices, saying it has failed to comply with domestic content requirements for smartphones and tablets. The Cupertino, California-based company had pledged in 2023 to invest 1.7 trillion rupiah ($107 million) for developer academies across Indonesia yet had fallen short by some $10 million.\nRoeslani doubled-down on an earlier government demand that Apple should offer Indonesia a better deal than Vietnam, where it\u2019s funneled about $15 billion for manufacturing facilities. \u201cTheir investment must be bigger,\u201d he said.\nIndustry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, whose office had imposed the iPhone 16 ban, said last month that his top priority was to get Apple to open a local plant, similar to other phone makers like Samsung Electronics Co. and Xiaomi Corp.\nIf Apple manufactures its devices locally, it would create a ripple effect of investments across related sectors and create more jobs, Roeslani said. \u201cThe most important thing is that the global value chain will move to us,\u201d he said.\nIndonesia has a long track record of playing hardball with companies to seek more investment and protect its domestic industry. The government has forced ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok to split its shopping feature from its social media platform a bid to shield its retail sector from cheap Chinese-made goods. It\u2019s also banned the export of raw materials like nickel to push companies to process minerals onshore and develop local battery plants.\nStory Continues\nThe intensified push for investment comes as newly inaugurated President Prabowo Subianto aims to reach 8% economic growth in his five-year term. Gross domestic product expanded at just 4.95% last quarter, its slowest pace in a year, amid weakening factory activity and consumption.\nIndonesia is a potential growth market for Apple with a young, increasingly tech-savvy population. The $1-trillion economy has over 350 million active mobile phones, outnumbering the nation\u2019s 270 million population, according to government data.\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n(Updates to say Apple didn\u2019t immediately reply to requests for comment in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nElon Musk\u2019s Least Favorite Judge Strikes Again\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

The underperformance reflects investor pessimism toward China\u2019s economic revival efforts, on top of concerns over monetization and trade bans.\nThe latest earnings season disappointed, with neither Beijing\u2019s recent stimulus nor the AI euphoria yet to offer much upside. Tencent Holdings Ltd. President Martin Lau said the firm\u2019s cloud computing business won\u2019t be \u201cexploding\u201d from AI demand the way it has for US peers, as Chinese customers just aren\u2019t spending that much on the technology.\n\u201cObviously, the next thing we\u2019re hoping for is AI, but there are some factors that make it a bit more challenging in China,\u201d said Richard Clode, who manages Janus Henderson\u2019s $1.85 billion Global Technology Leaders Fund in London. With fewer startups, slower digitalization and restricted access to the latest chips, \u201cthe new trend is just not as powerful in China as in some other bits of the world,\u201d he said.\nThe biggest driver of the huge gains in US tech stocks has been Nvidia Corp., the AI juggernaut that China has little chance of rivaling near term. While the Biden administration\u2019s latest restrictions on tech exports stop short of prior threats, incoming US president Donald Trump has taken a hardline stance against China and his plans remain to be seen.\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s internet pioneers are reeling from the impact of weak consumer demand and fierce competition on their e-commerce and game operations. AI business is providing little comfort as the nation lags in adoption of the new technology.\nCloud revenue for the September quarter rose 11% from a year ago at Baidu Inc. and 7% at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. amid sluggish AI-related business. That compares with over 30% growth at Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Azure and an almost 20% gain for Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS.\nDespite trade restrictions, Baidu and Tencent have said over the past year that they have enough chips to train their large language models for the foreseeable future. However, monetization of AI operations has been a key challenge.\nStory Continues\nAlibaba, Tencent and state-backed competitors have been locked in a lengthy price war to attract cloud customers who are reluctant to spend. Baidu\u2019s recent results showed AI-powered search content is failing to drive advertising sales.\nUnlike US peers, China\u2019s tech industry doesn\u2019t have a mature enterprise software industry racing to incorporate AI, or lots of startups consuming computing power from the cloud, said Daisy Li, a fund manager at EFG Asset Management HK Ltd. \u201cAlthough investors may speculate on Chinese AI application firms based on the trading of their US counterparts, the fundamentals of the two markets are actually quite different.\u201d\nWith confidence in Beijing\u2019s economic measures slipping and lack of support from corporate earnings, the Hang Seng Tech Index is down 18% from an October peak. The Nasdaq 100 has gained more than 7% in the same span.\nOne positive from this is that Chinese tech stocks are now more than 40% cheaper than American peers. The Hang Seng Tech trades at 15 times estimated forward earnings versus more than 26 times for the US tech gauge. That may not be enough to lure growth-focused investors back for now.\nIn China, \u201cI think the internet story is just maturing, which means to a lower growth outlook,\u201d said Janus Henderson\u2019s Clode, who has been investing in Chinese tech stocks for about 20 years. \u201cThere\u2019s not much growth and there are a lot of players trying to get that growth. So that\u2019s not the best backdrop for investing.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nSalesforce Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts\u2019 estimates, boosting investor hopes that the company\u2019s much-hyped strategy for artificial intelligence products will lift financial results.\nUS telecommunications companies are still working to kick out state-sponsored Chinese hackers who breached their networks as part of a spying campaign that dates back months, US officials said Tuesday.\nAmazon.com Inc. is ramping up its artificial intelligence offerings, rolling out powerful new chip arrays and a large language model it says can compete with leading rivals.\nIntel Corp.\u2019s search for a new chief executive officer will focus heavily on outsiders, with the chipmaker considering candidates such as Marvell Technology Inc. head Matt Murphy and former Cadence Design Systems Inc. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, according to people familar with the situation.\n--With assistance from Catherine Ngai.\n(Updates with share-price changes in the second paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nElon Musk\u2019s Least Favorite Judge Strikes Again\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., Stryker Corp. and Lam Research Corp., as well as a micro-cap stock, ImmuCell Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nAmazon\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet \u2013 Commerce industry over the past year (+45.5% vs. +40.8%). The Zacks analyst believes that strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed well to the stock's performance. Ultrafast delivery services, expanding content portfolio and Amazon\u2019s expanding global presence have also benefited the company. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\nHowever, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon here >>>)\nStryker\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+33.9% vs. +20.9%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong international sales, ongoing procedural recovery and a strong order book for capital equipment bode well for the company. Strong customer demand is a major plus.\nYet, inflationary pressure and supply-chain challenges continue to plague Stryker. Stiff competition in the MedTech space remains a headwind.\n(You can read the full research report on Stryker here >>>)\nShares of Lam Research have underperformed the Zacks Electronics \u2013 Semiconductors industry over the past year (+10.6% vs. +45.7%). Per the Zacks analyst, global spending on mature nodes is likely to be flat year over year. Growing tensions between the United States and China remain major concerns and have contributed to the stocks underperformance this year.\nHowever, the company is riding on its strength across 3D DRAM and advanced packaging technologies. Also, rebound in the system business owing to improving memory spending is a positive.\nStory Continues\n(You can read the full research report on Lam Research here >>>)\nImmucell\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the last six months (-3.9% vs. +11.9%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company has been hindered by high production costs and increased depreciation from expanded facilities. High customer concentration, shareholder dilution and competition from giants like Zoetis and Merck also pose risks.\nYet, robust customer demand for First Defense has been a key driver of sales growth. The remediation of contamination issues and investments in capacity expansion have positioned the company to stabilize output at higher levels.\n(You can read the full research report on Immucell here >>>)\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average delivered weekly gains in excess of 1%, capping a robust month and finishing at fresh record highs.\nLast Friday\u2019s rally marked the best post-Thanksgiving move for the S&P 500 since 2012. The Nasdaq posted a similar weekly advance but remains just below its own all-time high.\nOn the month, the S&P 500 climbed 5.73%, while the Nasdaq rose an impressive 6.21%. But it\u2019s the Dow that\u2019s been outperforming, as the major industrial average soared 7.54% in November. Even better, the Russell 2000 surged 10.8% as small-caps respond favorably to the idea of deregulation under a second Trump administration.\nWe\u2019re seeing clear signs of sector rotation. Certain pockets of the market are returning to the forefront (namely financials and industrials), while others have taken a backseat. Tech stocks have undoubtedly led this bull market since its start more than two years ago, but they\u2019ve been mainly lagging in this new post-election era, in part due to weakness in semiconductor stocks.\nWhile the third-quarter earnings season has wound down, market participants will still receive a number of big-time reports this week including the likes of Marvell Technology and Lululemon, to name a few.\nSeasonality Supports More Gains in December\nStocks have climbed higher 9 out of the past 10 times in December during election years. Needless to say, those are pretty good odds.\nSince 1950, the month of December ranks third-best for the Dow and S&P 500, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively. It\u2019s the third-best month as well for the Nasdaq (since 1971) and second-best for the Russell 2000 (since 1979).\nWe rarely see big declines in the Christmas-themed month; the last large monthly loss was in 2018, which was the worst December performance for the Dow since 1931.\nWhen markets have experienced fantastic gains leading up to December (as was the case this year), stocks usually consolidate in the first half of the month. This is mainly due to profit-taking and the implementation of tax harvesting strategies by institutions.\nStory Continues\nOn a brighter note, no other month is likely to be positive in election years, with the S&P 500 higher more than 83% of the time since 1950. And with substantial gains heading into December, a year-end rally is quite possible. The past 10 instances in which the S&P 500 was up at least 20% going into December, the final month of the year was up 9/10 times with an average gain of 2.4%:\nData Indicative of Resilient Economy\nAmerican consumers continue to pull out their wallets. Black Friday sales grew at a quicker pace in the US this year; retail sales rose 3.4% according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, outpacing last year\u2019s figure. Online sales surged 14.6% as e-commerce growth dominates shopping trends. The trend resumed on Cyber Monday, when Americans spent $13.3 billion online \u2013 a 7.3% jump relative to the same day in 2023.\nMeanwhile, the underlying inflation trend has stalled a bit but remains on a downward trajectory. Last week, we learned that the minutes from the Fed\u2019s November meeting showed officials preferred a gradual pace of interest rate cuts and will remain dependent on incoming data.\n\u201cParticipants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to 2% and the economy remaining near maximum employment, it would likely be appropriate to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time,\u201d the minutes read.\nMarkets are pricing in a roughly 80% chance of a 25-basis point cut at the upcoming meeting.\nThe core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out volatile food and energy components, rose 0.3% in October from the prior month, in line with expectations. On an annual basis, core prices rose 2.8%, also meeting estimates.\nIn terms of economic growth, the second estimate of third-quarter GDP was unchanged, showing the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.8% during the period.\nAnd the jobs market has held up well despite some signs of cooling. The number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits moved lower to 213,000 for the week ending November 23rd, down from 215k during the prior week. We\u2019ll get the November employment report on Friday, which is expected to show the US economy added 214,000 jobs last month.\nStocks to Watch in December\nPayment service provider Block saw its shares hit a 52-week high on Monday following the heavy shopping weekend. Sellers using Block\u2019s suite of products broke records with 144 million global consumer transactions, a 17% improvement versus last year. Block stock, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been underperforming this year with an 18.5% return.\nCloud computing and retail giant Amazon held its Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event from November 21st through December 2nd, and it turned out to be the largest in the company\u2019s history. The event witnessed record sales along with the highest number of items sold. Devices such as the Amazon Echo and Fire TV were two of the best-selling products. Amazon stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has been outperforming the market, up nearly 40% this year.\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla saw its stock decline on Tuesday after a Delaware judge blocked CEO Elon Musk\u2019s massive compensation package for the second time this year. Tesla is likely to file an appeal based on the fact that the package was approved by shareholders by an overwhelming majority. Tesla stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and broke out in November. Shares are up better than 40% year-to-date.\nBottom Line\nThe S&P 500 is up more than 25% this year through November. If we finish in this territory, it would be the first time since 1998-99 that the benchmark index rose 20% or more in consecutive years.\nWith many stocks somewhat extended here, it simply doesn\u2019t make much sense to get too aggressive into the end of the year. As discussed, the beginning of the month can be a bit of a lull, particularly when we\u2019ve had a strong year.\nBut things then tend to pick up in the latter half of the month. And from a historical perspective, prospects of a year-end rally appear enticing. Make sure you\u2019re taking advantage of all that Zacks has to offer as markets look to close out a banner 2024 on a positive note.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

ANF, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Chewy, Inc. CHWY and Torrid Holdings Inc. CURV.\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n4 Retail Stocks to Buy as Cyber Monday Drives Holiday Shopping Spree\nCyber Monday has emerged as one of the major shopping events second only to Black Friday, offering bargain hunters another opportunity to grab amazing deals and discounts. According to Adobe Analytics, Cyber Monday sales are likely to be strong, propelled by stellar consumer demand and an expanding e-commerce landscape. Online spending is expected to have reached more than $13 billion.\nRetailers \u2014 Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Amazon.com, Inc., Chewy, Inc. and Torrid Holdings Inc. \u2014 are embracing innovative strategies and enhancing delivery logistics to provide consumers seamless shopping experience. The integration of store, online and mobile platforms is not only enhancing convenience but also driving higher conversion rates. Services such as doorstep delivery, curbside pickup and buy online, pick up in-store offer expedited delivery options and flexibility for shoppers.\nWith inflationary pressures moderating and consumer confidence stabilizing, the outlook for retail remains positive. Moreover, the rise of \u201cBuy Now, Pay Later\u201d options and expanded payment flexibility are enhancing consumer purchasing power. These innovations have enabled shoppers to spend more freely, boosting holiday sales.\nGiven these dynamics, several retail stocks stand out as promising investment opportunities.

          "whole_article": "The District of Columbia sued Amazon on Wednesday, alleging the company secretly stopped providing its fastest delivery service to residents of two predominantly Black neighborhoods while still charging millions of dollars for a membership that promises the benefit.\nThe complaint filed in District of Columbia Superior Court revolves around Amazon\u2019s Prime membership, which costs consumers $139 per year or $14.99 per month for fast deliveries \u2014 including one-day, two-day and same-day shipments \u2014 along with other enhancements.\nIn mid-2022, the lawsuit alleges, the Seattle-based online retailer imposed what it called a delivery \u201cexclusion\u201d on two low-income zip codes in the district \u2014 20019 and 20020 \u2014 and began relying exclusively on third-party delivery services such as UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, rather than its own delivery systems.\nAmazon says it made the change based on concerns about driver safety.\n\u201cThere have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages\u201d in the two zip codes and the company made the change to \u201cput the safety of delivery drivers first,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a prepared statement.\n\u201cWe made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers,\u201d Nantel said. \u201cThe claims made by the attorney general, that our business practices are somehow discriminatory or deceptive, are categorically false.\u201d\nThe District of Columbia's attorney general\u2019s office alleged the company never told Prime members in the two zip codes about the change even though they experienced slower deliveries as a result. Amazon also did not tell new customers about the exclusions when they signed up for Prime memberships, the lawsuit says.\n\u201cAmazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in a statement, referencing the two areas in the city where Amazon is accused of excluding its speediest deliveries.\n\u201cWhile Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" Schwalb said.\nThe lawsuit says Amazon has nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the two zip codes, a number that represents nearly half of the population. Prime members in those neighborhoods have ordered more than 4.5 million packages in the past four years, and are more likely to rely on Amazon since they have fewer services and retail stores nearby, the city said. The area is also a notorious food desert.\nStory Continues\nThe district says that in 2021, before Amazon implemented its delivery \u201cexclusion,\u201d more than 72% of Prime packages in the impacted zip codes were delivered within two days. But last year, it was only 24%, according to the complaint.\nMeanwhile, the district's lawsuit says Prime members who lived in other parts of the city received two-day deliveries 75% of the time. Amazon was also improving its delivery speeds nationwide.\nWhen some customers in the city complained about the slower deliveries, Amazon concealed the true reason for the delays and \u201cdeceptively implied\" that the delays \"were simply due to natural fluctuations in shipping circumstances, rather than an affirmative decision by Amazon,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nDistrict officials are asking the court to issue an order prohibiting Amazon from \u201cengaging in unfair or deceptive practices.\u201d They also want the company to pay restitution or damages to affected Prime members, as well as civil penalties.\nNantel said Amazon is \u201calways transparent\u201d with its customers \u201cduring the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive.\u201d Since 2022, nearly 1.5 million Prime-eligible products were delivered in two days or less to Prime customers residing in the two zip codes, the company said.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to do, and have offered, is to work together with the attorney general and their office in an effort to reduce crime and improve safety in these areas,\u201d Nantel aid. \"Nevertheless, we will proceed in the process and demonstrate that providing fast and accurate delivery times and prioritizing the safety of customers and delivery partners are not mutually exclusive.\u201d\nThe complaint filed Wednesday represents the second major legal battle between Amazon and the District of Columbia which also filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company.\nView Comments"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Stryker Corp. (SYK) and Lam Research Corp.

The Zacks analyst believes that strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed well to the stock's performance. Ultrafast delivery services, expanding content portfolio and Amazon\u2019s expanding global presence have also benefited the company. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\nHowever, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds.

Strong earnings growth forecasts, top Zacks Ranks, and compelling technical setups are bolstering their bullish outlook.\nBelow, we explore why these three Magnificent Seven members stand out and why they could be smart buys for investors seeking both growth and momentum.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta Platforms (META): Fair Valuation and Momentum Breakout\nMeta Platforms has been a market darling this year, thanks to its relentless focus on profitability and innovation. Following a period of heavy investment in its metaverse initiatives, Meta has shifted gears toward efficiency, and investors have rewarded the pivot with confidence in the stock.\nWhy Meta Looks Compelling Now:\nValuation: Despite its significant run-up, Meta remains attractively valued compared to its tech peers. Today, it is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 26.1x, a reasonable multiple for such a fast growing and profitable company.\nEarnings Growth: Meta boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), underpinned by strong earnings growth forecasts. Analysts project continued revenue and profit expansion with earnings expected to climb at an impressive 20% annually over the next three to five years.\nTechnical Setup: From a charting perspective, Meta is in the midst of a major technical breakout. After consolidating for several weeks it is breaking out today.\nInvestors seeking a combination of growth and value should strongly consider Meta, particularly as pushes new all-time highs.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nAmazon (AMZN): AWS Reacceleration Ignites Growth\nAmazon has reclaimed its status as a market leader, benefiting from an improving macro environment and the reacceleration of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment. Despite its size, Amazon has demonstrated remarkable flexibility in adapting to changing consumer and business needs, allowing it to maintain its dominance across e-commerce and cloud computing.\nKey Catalysts for Amazon:\nValuation: Amazon remains historically cheap relative to its growth potential. Today, Amazon trades at a one year forward earnings multiple of 40x, which is near the most reasonable valuation in the company\u2019s history.\nEarnings Momentum: With a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Amazon is seeing upward revisions to earnings forecasts as analysts anticipate strong performance in cloud computing and ongoing efficiency gains in e-commerce. EPS are forecast to grow 28.9% annually, the highest projection among the Mag 7 stocks.\nTechnical Strength: Amazon\u2019s stock price is approaching record highs, fueled by a powerful uptrend. A breakout above these levels could trigger further buying as investors pile in.\nStory Continues\nFor long-term investors, Amazon\u2019s blend of robust fundamentals and improving technical momentum makes it a must-watch candidate for portfolios focused on mega-cap growth.\nTradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nTesla (TSLA): Epic Rally in Progress\nTesla\u2019s stock has been a force of nature in 2024, surging alongside Elon Musk\u2019s ever-expanding influence. Known for its cyclical trading patterns\u2014alternating between massive rallies and sharp corrections\u2014Tesla is currently in the midst of one of its epic bullish phases.\nWhy Tesla Stands Out:\nLeadership and Vision: Tesla\u2019s position as a leader in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy solutions continues to drive investor enthusiasm. Elon Musk\u2019s outsized presence in the tech and business world has only amplified Tesla\u2019s ability to command attention and capital.\nMomentum: Tesla holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and exhibits tremendous price momentum. Analysts expect continued earnings growth as the company benefits from economies of scale and the increasing adoption of EVs globally.\nTechnical Indicators: Tesla is forming a bull flag continuation pattern, which is a textbook bullish setup. If the stock breaks out of this consolidation, it could retest its 2022 record highs, presenting significant upside potential.\nTesla\u2019s ability to maintain a cult following, combined with its explosive trading patterns, makes it a prime candidate for investors willing to ride the wave of its current rally.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShould Investors Buy Shares in TSLA, AMZN, and META?\nFor growth-oriented investors, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla represent some of the most compelling opportunities among the Magnificent Seven and in today\u2019s market. Each company is backed by strong earnings forecasts, attractive valuations, and bullish technical setups.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine Netflix\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\nSee our latest analysis for Netflix\nWhat Is Netflix Worth?\nAccording to our valuation model, Netflix seems to be fairly priced at around 16.08% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Netflix today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $773.37, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Netflix\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from Netflix?\nNasdaqGS:NFLX Earnings and Revenue Growth December 3rd 2024\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Netflix. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NFLX\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NFLX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of Wells Fargo\u2019s Tech Stocks To Beat The S&P: 14 Top AI & Non-AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks.\nAs 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. They beckon 2025 with a rather historic run on the stock market that has seen several high-growth technology stocks flourish despite the fact that until September, interest rates in the US were at a two-decade high level.\nDriving the bullishness behind technology stocks is artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that relies on high-end GPUs to run advanced mathematical techniques and infer new conclusions from existing data sets has been the focus of Wall Street and big technology companies. So far, most of the AI-related stock gains have been limited to the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite graphics processing unit (GPU) company whose stock is up by more than\u00a0700%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nHowever, the gains have to broaden out to other stocks for the AI wave to continue. This broadening is dependent on the use of AI increasing among businesses and consumers. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo has some insights to share. In its report titled \u2018Generative AI \u2014 Potential pitfalls, challenges, and risks the bank outlines that while AI \u201chas the potential to be broadly transformative,\u201d there are several \u201coutstanding questions and concerns that need to be addressed before it is widely accepted on a larger scale.\u201d Quoting its \u2018The AI Index 2024 Annual Report,\u2019 the bank points out that from 2012 to 2023, the number of AI incidents has jumped more than tenfold from sitting at roughly 10 to ~122. These incidents cover the ethical misuse of AI such as the wrong detection of criminals stemming from facial recognition systems.\nWF\u00a0points\u00a0out that while these incidents are concerning, other factors will also determine AI\u2019s wider acceptability and use. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints. The bank adds that these factors are also accompanied by the potentially transformative effect of AI on the labor market. Starting from its beliefs about the labor market, WF believes that generative AI, which is different from other AI systems such as machine learning, will have a more \u201cnuanced\u201d impact on the labor market compared to traditional AI. Commenting on common worries of AI taking jobs away, the bank outlines that the jobs that AI will replace will in turn be replaced by new jobs created by AI. To quote WF, it believes \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s disruptive effect on the labor market to mirror other forms of automation \u2014 as in the past, its impact likely will be mitigated over time by new occupations spawned by the innovations themselves.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTo help bolster its claim, WF shares data from MIT. It points out that MIT\u2019s estimates show that \u201c60% of U.S. workers are now employed in occupations that did not exist 84 years ago.\u201d As for which job functions might give way to AI, these include knowledge-based roles such as those found in financial services and support roles such as those performed by customer support agents.\nTwo additional key disruptive AI effects that Wall Street in particular is keenly aware of are its rising costs and the effect on the utility industry. The S&P\u2019s utility sector is up by 28.36% year-to-date which leads the broader index\u2019s 26.48% in gains by nearly two percentage points. Commenting on this, the bank believes that \u201cthere will be a significant increase in hardware demand, notably within the data-center environment, to accommodate the substantial increase in AI workloads,\u201d adding that \u201cit may take a number of years to increase the operational efficiency of various large language models and decrease costs to a level more in-line with existing search engines.\u201d WF also shares that while existing opportunities to expand data center footprint to accommodate AI are present, as they \u201cdiminish, companies may revisit existing data-center locations to retrofit and upgrade hardware and infrastructure in support of the power and data-consumption needs of new AI technologies.\u201d\nGiven the criticality of the data center space to AI, WF expands on this sector in another\u00a0report. Titled \u2018Generative AI transforming data center landscape\u201d it comments on the capital expenditure required to set up data centers, future trends for data centers, and the stock market sectors that might benefit from growing interest and focus on the data center industry. According to its analysis, investor attention is mostly focused on AI-related investments in semiconductors and cloud computing.\nHowever, other sectors, such as \u201ccabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators\u201d are also important. WF quotes a utility company to explain why these tertiary sectors are critical in the AI wave. It shares that utility company believes that \u201cthe server rack power density required to train a generative-AI-based large language model can require up to five to seven times more power than server racks used for traditional IT workloads in a data center.\u201d\nWhile semiconductor companies are natural beneficiaries of the AI boom, some oft-ignored sectors that WF mentions are industrials and materials. It outlines that when it comes to building massive data centers, estimates suggest \u201cthat approximately 35% \u2013 45% of the cost is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out. These areas are addressable by companies who supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors).\u201d Additionally, \u201c40% \u2013 45% and 15% \u2013 20% of the remaining cost can be attributed to electrical and HVAC systems respectively,\u201d according to Wells Fargo. AI is having an effect on materials, as per the bank, in the form of \u201cincreased demand for materials that are used in the production of semiconductor chips, water handling and recycling within data centers, and steel and construction materials to build data centers.\u201d\nFor some materials stocks and a primer on how they are reliant on the broader economic activity, you can check out\u00a010 Best Materials Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s top AI & non-AI stocks that can outpace the flagship S&P, we selected technology-focused stocks from the bank\u2019s recent Focus List and ranked them by their consensus next twelve-month EPS estimates.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 121\nNTM EPS Estimate: $22.77\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the world\u2019s biggest video streaming company. It enjoys a wide moat in the industry and is the market leader. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s market position has enabled it to amass a whopping 282.7 million subscribers under its belt. This subscriber base is the key to the firm\u2019s hypothesis, as its fate now depends on the ability to monetize the user base, retain its customers, and add new users into its fold. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also benefits from the fact that it produces television shows and movies, which sets it apart by offering exclusive content to its subscribers. The ability to take on traditional television channels and bolster its user base is central to creating tailwinds as is evident by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s 6.5% share price gain since the historic fight between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul which saw 60 million household worldwide tune into its platform.\nEnsemble Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cThe rapid recovery of Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth has shocked investors who drove the stock down to a price of just $166 in May 2022. While at the time, bearish investors were declaring the company\u2019s growth days were behind it, instead the company added a remarkable 13.1 million new subscribers in the most recent quarter. This was the single largest quarterly subscriber addition other than the large gains experienced during the first quarter of COVID. For all of 2023, the company added nearly 30 million new subscribers, making it the largest annual gain in Netflix history other than the first year of COVID.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 2nd on our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks. NFLX\u00a0 is a top cyclical stock Wells Fargo is confident about. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

The new price target reflects a 32X multiple on their 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $30.\nEvercore highlighted that the company is seeing significant upside potential, with a mid-single-digit percentage increase to street 2026 EPS estimates.\nThe firm noted that Netflix could see even more substantial gains if it returns to its historical price increase cadence.\nHowever, they caution that the $950 price target doesn't imply dramatic near-term upside, and Netflix remains a \"relatively small buy\" for them at current levels.\nThe positive survey results, which include data from the U.S., France, and Germany, are said to underscore Netflix's competitive edge in the streaming industry.\n\"Netflix is in the strongest position financially, fundamentally, and competitively that we have ever seen,\" the firm stated. Key drivers are said to include improved churn intent and price sensitivity results across all three markets, which bode well for its subscription business.\nFour major catalysts for Netflix in the near term include Christmas Day NFL games, the much-anticipated release of Squid Games II on December 26, WWE Raw in January, and upcoming price increases.\nEvercore also noted that Netflix continues to expand its competitive lead in terms of content quality and is gaining traction with its live sports and stand-up comedy offerings.\nWith the firm\u2019s positive outlook on Netflix\u2019s ability to sustain its growth, it remains confident in the stock\u2019s future prospects.\nRelated Articles\nNetflix stock target raised at Evercore on 'very strong catalyst path'\nIntel CEO Gelsinger forced out after board lost confidence in turnaround plan\nFirst Solar shares climb on raised target, positive outlook\nView Comments"

But as I learned while trying not to be distracted by the drone flying out of Serhant\u2019s office window capturing wide shots, his fame is a feature, not a bug.\nMaybe you recognize Serhant\u2019s name from Million Dollar Listing or his new Netflix show, Owning Manhattan. Or maybe you\u2019ve bought an apartment from the man himself or one of his rapidly growing army of brokers, all operating under his eponymous real estate empire, which closed the sixth most residential sales in Manhattan last year, according to the Real Deal.\u00a0(Serhant tells me he\u2019s opening in a new market roughly every 14 days.)\nBut now, Serhant wants to position himself as a tech entrepreneur, raising $45 million from the respected New York venture firms Camber Creek and Left Lane Capital and launching an app called S.MPLE, designed to help brokers navigate their sales.\nMost software founders gain celebrity because of the success of their products, but from his flagship headquarters in SoHo, which greets guests with a massive statue of an S right inside the front door, Serhant makes a convincing case for why the reverse can also be true.\nThrough his reality shows and millions of social media followers, Serhant helped pioneer a new form of real estate sales, where brokers find buyers through virality rather than staid listings in newspapers and Craigslist. His average agent is 20 years younger than the industry average. \u201cThey only know their business through social media,\u201d he tells me. The number one lead generator? LinkedIn.\nSerhant describes S.MPLE as \u201cInstacart for salespeople\u201d (See, he really is one of you.) It wasn\u2019t his first foray into developing real estate-focused tech, including an aborted metaverse platform called UNIVERS and a real-time video editing app called Spaces, which never took off with his agents. \u201cI used to call them missteps,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to go through that process.\u201d\nS.MPLE came as a learning from his second attempt\u2014that people want to spend less time on their screens, rather than more. The app allows brokers to automate parts of their sales process, from listings to communication. Rather than your typical SaaS product though, the real innovation\u2014like Serhant\u2019s brokerage business\u2014is his distribution funnel. Every aspect of his operation, from social media to reality TV to actual real estate sales\u2014works as a flywheel to generate more business. \u201cOur customer acquisition cost is near zero,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIf a significant amount of your dollars are going to Meta ad spend or figuring out how to take a product and create distribution, it's just a rough race.\u201d\nStory Continues\nSerhant says that he\u2019s been profitable from the beginning and that he\u2019s bringing venture investors on board because of the help they can provide from a strategic partnership perspective, with Left Lane Capital known for its consumer-focused portfolio and Camber Creek focused on property technology. Both firms recognized Serhant\u2019s \u201cinherent value,\u201d as Left Lane Capital\u2019s Harley Miller describes it. \u201cIt's made investors like us wake up to the power of this distribution and how big of a value driver and unique competitive moat it can be,\u201d Miller tells me.\nJeffrey Berman, general partner at Camber Creek, says that the most successful firms in his portfolio have \u201ccracked the code\u201d of the business-to-business-to-consumer model. He points to the rent payment platform Flex, which deals with multi-family-owner operators who can market to tenants en masse. \u201cIt's not apples to apples with the idea of having a socially recognizable personality, but it's similar in terms of the ability to [market] at a relatively low cost,\u201d he says.\nFor now, Serhant is rolling S.MPLE out to brokers across his own company and plans to expand to other outfits. His software ambitions may not supersede his Netflix renown anytime soon, but that might only aid his efforts. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a quote-unquote celebrity broker,\u201d Berman tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s actually a technology CEO, and he\u2019s running a pretty big company at that.\u201d\nLeo Schwartz\nTwitter: @leomschwartz\nEmail: leo.schwartz@fortune.com\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\nNina Ajemian curated the deals section of today\u2019s newsletter.

(NASDAQ:MGNI) stands against the other best Adtech stocks to buy.\nAs per Dimension Market Research, the Global\u00a0AdTech market\u00a0size touched\u00a0US$1,066.8 billion in 2023\u00a0and should reach US$3,528.4 billion by 2032. The market is expected to compound at ~14.2% from 2024 to 2032.\u00a0Some of the critical trends include a strong emphasis on privacy-centric advertising, growth fueled by AI-driven personalization, and dominance of video and mobile advertising.\nKey Trends Defining the AdTech Market\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning continue to drive sophisticated audience segmentation and personalized ad experiences. As per Geomotiv, a software development company, these technologies can quickly analyze vast amounts of data, predict user behavior, and tailor ads in real time. Collectively, these features help to improve engagement and conversion rates. The benefits of personalization and the opportunities provided should drive the demand for these solutions and the growth of AI-oriented AdTech companies.\nMarket experts believe that advertisers continue to target Programmatic advertising. This space continues to expand beyond traditional digital channels. Adnimation, a software company, highlighted that CTV ad spending is expected to grow to\u00a0$42.4 billion by 2027\u00a0in the US. Publishers that have video content should prioritize CTV and\u00a0find for best supply-side platform (SSP)\u00a0to tap into a rapidly growing market.\nAdvertisers have been leveraging programmatic to reach the audiences with targeted ads. Furthermore, programmatic continues to make inroads into the audio format, such as podcasts and music streaming services. Next, AdTech SaaS companies have been providing customizable solutions, which enable advertisers to tailor the tools and features as per the specific needs. The popularity of these products continues to grow among advertisers and publishers.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\nBlockchain and\u00a0Influencer Marketing Should Drive Growth\nAs per Adnimation, data-driven influencer marketing is expected to dominate the broader AdTech market. Furthermore, the publishers and their AdTech counterparts continue collaborating with micro-influencers to fuel engagement and conversions. \u00a0Blockchain technology should also be key in ensuring transparency in digital ad transactions. By decentralizing ad transactions, blockchain can help reduce ad fraud, improve trust between publishers and advertisers, and enable accurate tracking of ad performance. This will result in more reliable revenue streams. Adnimation also believes that, by 2025, video is expected to dominate digital ad formats, making up\u00a082% of all internet traffic.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo list the 11 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we scanned through online rankings and AdTech-focused ETFs.

The collaboration is expected to have a substantial impact on Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s future revenues.\nBofA Securities\u00a0analyst Omar Dessouky\u00a0believes that the Netflix partnership should result in a $30-million revenue run rate by 2025 end.\u00a0 Furthermore, the analyst believes that the Netflix partnership should be able to contribute $44 million/$69 million/$199 million\u00a0to Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s revenue in 2026, 2027, and 2028. Industry experts believe that Netflix should become the company\u2019s largest CTV customer, which should help it offset any weakness from other partnerships.\nAs Netflix's ad-supported tier grows, Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) is expected to see improved revenue without proportional increases in costs. This should result in higher profitability. Furthermore, the company\u2019s growth momentum is expected to be aided by its CTV advertising segment, which should see strong ad spend growth and programmatic adoption.\nMagnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s partnership with Disney got a\u00a02-year extension, which further strengthens a 6-year collaboration.\u00a0As a result of this, Magnite will help in monetizing Disney\u2019s vast ad-supported content, spanning more than 30 DSPs. Courtesy of this high-profile content, the expanded relationship gives Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) a strong standing in premium advertising.\nChoice Equities Capital Management, a hedge fund manager, recently released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMagnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) and CROX \u2013 Magnite, Inc. and Croc\u2019s Inc. remain holdings in the portfolio and were recently discussed in detail on the Yet Another Value Blog podcast, which can be found here: YAVB podcast. As discussed herein, both remain well-positioned in their respective industries and represent attractive values on anticipated cash flows in years to come. Magnite, as highlighted, looks attractive on its own merits, though shares could become particularly interesting should a handful of industry anti-trust events break their way.\u201d\nOverall, MGNI ranks 8th on our list of best AdTech stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MGNI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Roku (ROKU). Shares have added about 5.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Roku due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nROKU Q3 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Revenues Increase Y/Y\nRoku reported third-quarter 2024 loss of 6 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents. The company had incurred a loss of $2.33 per share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues increased 16.47% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to $1.062 billion and beat the consensus mark by 4.37%. Growth of The Roku Channel\u2019s streaming households and streaming hours drove third-quarter performance. Roku\u2019s streaming households and streaming hours grew 13% and 20%, respectively, year over year.\n\nStreaming Households were 85.5 million, representing a net increase of 2 million from the second quarter of 2024. The Roku Home Screen, which is the beginning of viewers\u2019 streaming experience, reaches U.S. households with more than 120 million people every day, reflecting greater engagement and more monetization opportunities.\n\nThe Roku operating system (OS) was again the #1 selling TV OS in the United States, with TV unit sales greater than the next two TV operating systems combined. The Roku OS was also the #1 selling TV OS in Mexico and Canada.\n\nGlobally, users streamed a record 32 billion hours in the third quarter, up 20% hours from the prior quarter.\n\nThe average revenue per user remained flat year over year at $41.1 (on a trailing 12-month basis).\n\nThe Roku Channel remained the #3 app on Roku\u2019s platform in the third quarter by both reach and engagement, with Streaming Hours up nearly 80% year over year. This ongoing growth is largely due to the company\u2019s position as the lead-in to TV and Home Screen\u2019s power to drive viewership. The Roku Channel\u2019s Nielsens\u2019 The Gauge hit an all-time high ranking for August 2024, representing 4.1% of total TV streaming time in the United States. Roku launched Roku Sports Channel in August providing viewers with free sports content. Good Morning Football: Overtime, a new extension series of NFL Network\u2019s long-running Good Morning Football was also added to the Roku Channel.\nQuarter Details\nPlatform revenues (85.5% of revenues) increased 15.43% year over year to $908.2 million, driven by contributions from streaming services distribution and advertising activities, despite continued softness within the media and entertainment vertical.\n\nDevices revenues (14.5% of revenues) rose 23% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to $154 million.\nStory Continues\nOperating Details\nGross margin, as a percentage of total revenues, expanded 476 basis points from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level to 45.2%.\n\nOperating expenses decreased 28.22% year over year to $515.83 million. As a percentage of total revenues, the metric contracted to 48.56% from 78.79% reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nResearch & development and sales & marketing expenses decreased 36.64% and 22.96% on a year-over-year basis to $178.79 million and $237.04 million, respectively. General & administrative expenses increased 22.3% to $99.9 million.\n\nIn the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $98.2 million against adjusted EBITDA of $43.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Roku reported the fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and trailing 12-month free cash flow.\n\nOperating loss was $35.8 million in the reported quarter compared with an operating loss of $349.8 million in the year-ago quarter.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $2.12 billion compared with $2.05 billion as of June 30, 2024. As of Sept 30, 2024, Roku had no long-term debt.\nGuidance\nFor fourth-quarter 2024, ROKU expects total net revenues of $1.14 billion, total gross profit of roughly $465 million and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.\nVGM Scores\nCurrently, Roku has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nRoku has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\nPerformance of an Industry Player\nRoku is part of the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry. Over the past month, Netflix (NFLX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 16.1%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2024 more than a month ago.\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of B.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Find out when Sabrina Carpenter hosts a holiday variety music special that streams on Netflix starting Friday, Dec. 6. \u201cIt\u2019s an hour of literal nonsense,\u201d Sabrina told Time magazine about the special. \u201cIf people are expecting boring, me singing by a tree, it\u2019s not that.

On Instagram, she previewed the album by saying \u201cI have poured my blood and tears into this album. I cannot wait for you to listen to this little journal of mine.\u201d\n\u2014 AP Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy\nNEW SHOWS TO STREAM DEC. 2-8\n\u2014 In their new Netflix series \u201cBlack Doves,\u201d Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw play old friends who also happen to be a spy and an assassin, that team up to solve a murder (and get revenge) at Christmas. Knightley joked to The Associated Press that the show falls in the \u201cDie Hard\u201d category of holiday entertainment. \u201cIt\u2019s like, I\u2019ve spent too much time with my family. I hate them all. I need to watch something blow up!\u201d \u201cBlack Doves\u201d debuts Thursday on the streamer.\n\u2014 Margo Martindale stars in the new Prime Video series \u201cThe Sticky,\u201d as a down-on-her-luck woman on the brink of financial ruin who finds herself in a crime ring stealing, of all things, millions of dollars\u2019 worth of maple syrup.

It premieres Friday, Dec. 6.\n\u2014 Alicia Rancilio\nNEW VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY\n\u2014 Multiplayer free-for-alls like Overwatch and Apex Legends remain popular online, but it\u2019s been years since a new release has made an impact. Chinese-owned NetEase Games is hoping to shake up the genre by adding superheroes and villains to the formula with Marvel Rivals. The core competition is a battle between two teams of six heroes each. The initial lineup includes marquee names like Spider-Man, Black Panther and Captain America as well as a few cult favorites like Luna Snow and Jeff the Land Shark. Some characters \u2014 say Thor, Loki and Hela \u2014 can join forces to unleash all sorts of havoc. It\u2019s all free-to-play, and the mayhem begins Friday, Dec. 6, on PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.\n\u2014 Lou Kesten\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "As the holiday season approaches, your desk drawers are likely to start filling up with gift cards: those plastic rectangles that seem like money but so often sit unused, forgotten and forlorn.\nThe U.S. gift card market is estimated at more than $200 billion, yet the industry is dominated by two little-known companies, Blackhawk and InComm, and has seen little innovation in recent decades, even as mobile payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay have grown in popularity.\nOn Me, a new startup founded by Google veterans Darragh Meaney and Sitar Harel, says it is poised to disrupt this duopoly with a digital-first gift card product not limited to individual retailers. On Me has raised $1.7 million in funding from payment giant Mastercard, as well as the top New York-based venture firm Lerer Hippeau.\n\"A lot of the gift card plays in the last 20 years have been wrappers around existing, very old technologies,\" Meaney told Fortune in an interview. \"What we want to do is build new technology rails from the ground up.\"\nGift economy\nGift cards may seem like a strange endeavor for two former Google employees, but Meaney says he was motivated to leave his \"cushy\" job after seeing the technological progress of mobile wallets. Rather than gift cards for specific restaurants or stores, Meaney and his cofounder's idea was to build a digital version that could be focused on specific hobbies, like running, to be used at a network of stores and integrated directly into Apple Pay or Google Pay.\nHe argues that single-merchant gift cards operate on the principle of \"breakage,\" or issuers earning revenue because gift cards go unspent, with Blackhawk and InComm offering the infrastructure. \"It really is the classic VC story of a $200 billion industry that's ripe for disruption,\" Meaney told Fortune.\nOn Me taps into specific stores that accept Mastercard, allowing its gift cards to be customizable across different merchants. In return, On Me earns affiliate revenue from dollars spent at stores, rather than relying on unredeemed balances.\nMastercard invested in the company without taking equity in return, instead coming on board as an advisor. Meaney attributes Mastercard's decision to wanting to bring the $200 billion gift card economy onto its own network of merchants. \"They're quite keen to get more interesting stuff on their rails, versus other places,\" Meaney said.\nHe admits that gift cards are just taking money and \"making it less fungible,\" but argues they are still popular because most people do not feel comfortable giving cash, or even cash-based debit cards, as gifts. Meaney says that by basing On Me around different hobbies, from beauty to dessert, gift cards can become even more customizable.\nStory Continues\nIsabelle Phelps, a partner at Lerer Hippeau, told Fortune that her firm was most excited about On Me's updated payment rails. \"It's enabled secure, personalized, gifting at scale that we think meets the needs of users,\" she said, adding that \"our phones are our wallets today.\"\nOn Me launched in November with a team of six and plans to expand the 70-odd categories available as gift cards, accounting for around 2,000 retailers.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- The Malaysian government has come under fire for its plan to tighten its grip over the internet, via regulations that critics warn could suppress dissent and undermine Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s pledge to protect free speech.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAs Wars Rage, Cities Face a Dark New Era of Urban Destruction\nRiyadh Metro Partially Opens in Bid to Ease City\u2019s Traffic Jams\nIn Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes\nThe government on Monday introduced a bill that seeks to impose stricter penalties on content violations and grant sweeping powers to law enforcement, such as the right of any \u201cauthorized officer\u201d to search and seize without a warrant.\nService providers may also be held liable under the law, and compelled to disclose user data to authorities during investigations of alleged violations. Representatives from companies such as Meta Platforms Inc., Elon Musk\u2019s X and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google could face arrest under the envisioned regime.\nWhile the government says the steps are necessary to curb illegal online content, critics say the proposed laws are the latest example of Anwar\u2019s administration going against earlier pledges to protect free speech.\nThe proposed amendments \u201cprioritize control over information, posing risks of censorship and suppression of dissent,\u201d Article 19 and the Centre for Independent Journalism said in a joint statement Tuesday. They include \u201chighly disproportionate punitive measures and strengthening of investigative powers.\u201d\nLawmakers are set to debate and vote on the proposed legislation during the current parliament meeting that ends Dec. 12, prompting civil rights groups to urge the government to hit pause, pending further consultation and public feedback.\nA spokesperson from the Communications Ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMalaysia joins efforts by governments across Asia to clamp down on online platforms and hold Big Tech firms accountable for illegal content. From Kuala Lumpur to New Delhi and Canberra, officials are increasingly looking for ways to regulate or curtail social media, which can sway public opinion on politically sensitive issues. Big tech firms like Meta have said in the past they comply with local regulations, but argue that over-regulation endangers public discourse and places unfair burdens on online platforms.\nVietnam last month ordered foreign social media platforms to verify the accounts of users and provide their identities to authorities on demand. Indonesian lawmakers are discussing a bill that might extend broadcasting curbs from TV and radio to online platforms such as Netflix Inc. and YouTube.\nStory Continues\nPotential offenses outlined by Malaysia on Monday include posting obscene, false, menacing and grossly offensive content such as hate speech. If the bill is approved, fines for certain offenses will increase more than threefold to 1 million Malaysian ringgit ($220,000), while the maximum prison time has been extended to 10 years from three.\nBut the restrictions include expansive and vague terms that could be arbitrarily interpreted, Article 19 and the CIJ warned. That, combined with the low threshold required to order surveillance measures, would violate the right to privacy and enable misuse of power, they said.\nThe Malaysian government \u201cseems to disregard public participation for purposes of political expediency. It is more focused on railroading through amendments that appear to control information and censor the internet,\u201d the civil groups said Tuesday.\n--With assistance from Norman Harsono and Francesca Stevens.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nElon Musk\u2019s Least Favorite Judge Strikes Again\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks.\nKen Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors.\nFisher said, \"I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused.\"\nBesides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors.\nIn the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips.\nREAD ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams\u2019 Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks.\nEven though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better.\n\"Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly,\" Ken Fisher said.\nKen Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the \"magnificent seven\" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions.\nStory Continues\n\"If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward\", Fisher said in a video interview.\nOur Methodology\nWe looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm's stake at the end of Q3 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAlphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) earns most of its money from ads on Google and YouTube, and it also sells apps and in-app purchases. Despite pressure from regulators to sell Google Chrome, Alphabet remains strong with many growing segments like Google Cloud, Google Pay, and the Google Store.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is famous for its Google search engine, which holds 90% of the market. The company is also making progress in AI. Pixel phone users can highlight items on the screen for AI-assisted searches, and 25% of Google's code is now written by AI. Google Cloud helps businesses create AI apps, and Waymo; Alphabet's self-driving car service, gives over 150,000 rides every week. These AI efforts helped Alphabet earn $88.3 billion in Q3, a 15% increase, with net income up 33% to $26.3 billion.\nThe fact that 15 of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s products and services are used by over 500 million people affirms its dominance as an internet company. The vast business empire generated $17.6 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter. Consequently, it remains one of billionaire Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks heading into 2025 as it returns value to shareholders through buybacks and dividend payouts.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 5th on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Management claims its AI integration into its search business is working well, and the margin expansion from costs out is expected to continue. Market chatter suggests that the selloff stems from concerns about the high capital spending on servers and data center equipment. Alphabet has made it clear that this spending is necessary, and somewhat defensive as it can\u2019t risk losing the AI war (a \u201cbuild it, and they will come\u201d approach). Also, the new Department of Justice case against it probably did not help matters. Nonetheless, we saw no need to adjust our estimates.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\"Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) recently lost an antitrust lawsuit related to its estimated $20 billion annual distribution agreement with Apple and other smartphone and web platforms. This legal setback negatively impacted Alphabet's stock price during the quarter. We anticipate significant uncertainty in the coming year as concerns about potential remedies cast a shadow over its lucrative search business. Despite this, we remain optimistic about Alphabet's overall business strength and ability to maintain leadership in various industries including search, artificial intelligence, video, and cloud computing.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days.\nThe debate around AI systems hitting a \u201cdata wall\u201d or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry.\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said:\n\u201cAll it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it\u2019s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI\u2019s Alexander Wang to Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei to Databricks\u2019 Ali Ghodsi weighing in.\u201d\nJensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said:\n\u201cA foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it\u2019s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we\u2019re learning, however, is that it\u2019s not enough that we\u2019ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.\u201d\nRead\u00a0Huang\u2019s comments in detail here.\nBosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said:\n\u201c\u2026..also acknowledge that this alone isn\u2019t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.\nStory Continues\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks currently trending on the back of latest analyst ratings and news. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nShould You Sell Alphabet (GOOG) Now Amid Google Chrome Worries?\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 160\nAlphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is under pressure after two reports. One, OpenAI is reportedly mulling developing a search engine to compete with Google. Two, DoJ plans to seek divestiture of Google Chrome, which is perhaps the crown jewel of Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s search business.\nChrome is just a browser. It does not bring any revenue on its own. So why is it so important? Chrome drives Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s revenue by sending traffic to its default search engine, which generates income through ads. In Q3 2024, Google Search brought in $49.4B, making up 56% of the company\u2019s total revenue for the quarter. Chrome also helps Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) gather browsing data, improve search relevance, and refine ad targeting, which attracts more advertisers willing to pay for prime ad space. It\u2019s crucial for maintaining Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s search dominance, holding around 89% of global search traffic and 50% of the US browser market. \u00a0Chrome also acts as a gateway to other Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) services like Gmail, YouTube, and Google accounts, boosting user engagement. Removing the seamless integration could hurt users.\nHowever, Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the stock is a buy on the current weakness and call the latest worries around Chrome an overreaction. They believe DoJ will use the Chrome divestiture threat as leverage to push Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0into agreeing to less severe actions, like ending exclusive contracts with device makers such as Apple and Samsung, or opening Chrome to third-party search engines, giving users more choice.\nColumbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) shares moved lower during the quarter, as the company was a victim of the rotation out of the technology sector and artificial intelligence-focused companies. In August, a federal judge ruled that Google had violated antitrust laws by engaging in unfair business tactics to dominate the Internet search advertising market. The central aspect of the government\u2019s case against Alphabet was that the company\u2019s $20 billion in annual payments to Apple made Google the default search engine on iPhones. Our team remains bullish on Alphabet\u2019s overall business model.\u201d\nOverall, GOOG ranks 4th on our list of top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "Looking for something to read over the Christmas holiday that can broaden your horizon? Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates offered up his selection of books to curl up with during a quiet moment as the year 2024 draws to a close.\nThe quartet of nonfiction works centers around a common theme, and unsurprisingly, most relate to technological progress shaping civilization during a fourth industrial revolution he helped bring about as co-founder of Microsoft.\n\u201cAll four are, in one way or another, about making sense of the world around you,\u201d Gates wrote in a post for his weblog entitled \u201cBooks to keep you warm this holiday season.\u201d\nSocial upheaval in the 1960s\nWhile the list largely relates to technology and its impact on society, he starts off with a personal account by author Doris Kearns Goodwin in her book\u00a0An Unfinished Love Story.\nGates said he was fascinated by her retelling of the upheaval during the 1960s, all seen through her own eyes as the wife of an aide to both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson during their respective time in the Oval Office.\n\u201cDoris is such a talented writer that the chapters about her love story are just as engaging and enlightening as the chapters about the Kennedy assassination and the Vietnam War,\u201d he wrote.\nThe link between digital natives and mental illness\nGates goes on to recommend\u00a0The Anxious Generation\u00a0by Jonathan Haidt. The Microsoft co-founder called it a \u201cmust-read\u201d for anyone interacting daily with today\u2019s youth, whether that\u2019s parents raising their children or teachers instructing pupils.\nThis digitally-native generation has grown up spending more time consuming TikTok videos or watching Twitch livestreamers, like Kai Cenat, than horsing around in the woods with the the next-door neighbors.\nThe disintegration of traditional social interaction symbolized by putting smartphones into the hands of children has resulted in surging levels of mental illness and anxiety, according to Gates.\n\u201cHaidt explains how the shift from play-based childhoods to phone-based childhoods is transforming how kids develop and process emotions,\u201d he says.\nAnswers to questions you never knew you had\nAll too often, people pass by marvels of modern society that melt into the background of our industrial landscape, largely going unnoticed.\nGrady Hillhouse\u2019s book Engineering in Plain Sight delves into the various devices that enable our modern lifestyle and how they work.\nThe author removes the mystery from everyday necessities like cell phone towers and explains in plain English what we would lose if they suddenly stopped working quietly in the background.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of read that will reward your curiosity and answer questions you didn\u2019t even know you had,\u201d Gates says.\nRisks and opportunities of AI\nThe Coming Wave\u00a0explains how artificial intelligence will \u201creshape every aspect of society\u201d, according to the philanthropist.\nAuthor is none other than Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of AI research lab DeepMind later acquired by Google a decade ago.\nAfter leaving the Silicon Valley giant, he\u2019s gone on to found his next AI startup, Inflection AI, and has been a vocal advocate of the need to regulate artificial intelligence.\n\u201cIf you want to understand the rise of AI, this is the best book to read,\u201d Gates recommends. (For those readers still hungry,\u00a0Fortune\u2019s\u00a0own Jeremy Kahn has followed the industry for years and published his own\u00a0survival guide\u00a0for the AI future)\nGates admits the recurring theme of making sense of the world around us during transformational periods of history wasn\u2019t intentional.\nYet today\u2019s turbulent events mean he wasn\u2019t surprised that he found these four books rewarding to read in the past year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural to try and wrap your head around things during times of rapid change, like we\u2019re living through now,\u201d he said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition: Microsoft President Brad Smith on AI's power demands; the U.S. imposes new export controls on chipmaking technology; a new milestone for distributed AI training; and are LLMs hitting a wall? It's complicated.\nI grew up watching reruns of the original Star Trek series. As anyone who's ever seen that show will know, there was a moment in seemingly every episode when the starship Enterprise would get into some kind of jam and need to outrun a pursuing alien spacecraft, or escape the powerful gravitational field of some hostile planet, or elude the tractor beam of some wily foe.\nIn every case, Captain Kirk would get on the intercom to the engine room and tell Scotty, the chief engineer, \u201cwe need more power.\u201d And, despite Scotty\u2019s protestations that the engine plant was already producing as much power as it possibly could without melting down, and despite occasional malfunctions that would add dramatic tension, Scotty and the engineering team would inevitably pull through and deliver the power the Enterprise needed to escape danger.\nAI, it seems, is entering its \u201cScotty, we need more power\u201d phase. In an interview the Financial Times published this week, two senior OpenAI executives said the company planned to build its own data centers in the U.S. Midwest and Southwest. This comes amid reports that there have been tensions with its large investor and strategic partner, Microsoft, over access to enough computing resources to keep training its advanced AI models. It also comes amid reports that OpenAI wants to construct data centers so large that they would each consume five gigawatts of power annually\u2014more than the electricity demands of the entire city of Miami. (It\u2019s unclear if the data centers the two OpenAI execs mentioned to the FT would be ones of such extraordinary size.)\nMicrosoft has plans for large new data centers of its own, as do Google, Amazon\u2019s AWS, Meta, Elon Musk\u2019s X AI, and more. All this data center construction has raised serious concerns about where all the electricity needed to power these massive AI supercomputing clusters will come from. In many cases, the answer seems to be nuclear power\u2014including a new generation of largely unproven small nuclear reactors, which might be dedicated to powering just a single data center\u2014which carries risks of its own.\nOn the sidelines of Web Summit in Lisbon a few weeks ago, I sat down with Microsoft President Brad Smith. Our conversation covered a variety of topics, but much of it focused on AI\u2019s seemingly insatiable demand for energy. As I mentioned in Eye on AI last Tuesday, some people at Web Summit, including Sarah Myers West of the AI Now Institute\u2014who was among the panelists on a main stage session I moderated debating \u201cIs the AI bubble about to burst?\u201d\u2014argued that energy demands of today\u2019s large language model-based AI systems are far too great. We\u2019d all be better off as a planet, she argued, if AI were a bubble and it burst\u2014and we moved on to some more energy efficient kind of AI technology.\nStory Continues\nWell, needless to say, Smith didn\u2019t exactly agree with that position. He was keen to point out that AI is hardly the only reason the U.S. needs to upgrade its electricity generating capacity and, just as critically, its electrical grid infrastructure.\nHe noted that the U.S. growth of energy generation capacity had only been in the low single digits annually over the past two decades. This was more than sufficient to keep pace with demand growth of about 0.5% per year during this period. But now electrical consumption is rising as much as 2% per year\u2014and while AI is among the drivers of this growth, it is not the principal one. Data center computing of all kinds, not just AI, is a factor. But more important is the growth in electric vehicles and the electricity demands of a resurgent U.S. manufacturing sector.\nAI currently constitutes about 3.5% of net energy demand in the U.S. and might increase to 7% to 8% by decade\u2019s end, Smith said. Even if it hit 15% of energy demand between then and 2070, that would still mean that 85% of the demand was coming from other sources.\n\u201cThe world needs more electricity and it will take a lot of work on a global basis to accommodate that,\u201d Smith said.\nSmith said that Microsoft\u2019s discussions with the Biden Administration over the past year have been about streamlining the federal permitting process for new data centers and the conversion of existing brownfield sites. Contrary to common perceptions, he said, it is not local government permitting or \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d (NIMBY) objections from local communities that pose the biggest headaches for tech companies looking to build data centers or power companies trying to upgrade the grid. Obtaining local permissions usually takes about nine months, he said. A far bigger problem is the federal government. Smith said obtaining a single Army Corps of Engineers wetlands permit takes 20 months on average, significantly slowing construction plans. He said he was optimistic that the incoming Trump Administration would clear away some of this red tape.\nSmith said Microsoft would be thrilled if Trump appointed North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum\u2014who, for a time in the early 2000s, headed Microsoft\u2019s Business Solutions division after he sold a company he founded to the tech giant\u2014as energy czar. That didn\u2019t exactly happen. Trump later nominated oil industry veteran Chris Wright to lead the Department of Energy, while tapping Burgum to be the Secretary of the Interior. Still Burgum may exercise considerable influence on U.S. energy policy from that position.\nSmith also highlighted that another impediment to upgrading America\u2019s electrical grid is a lack of trained electricians to work on high voltage transmission lines and transformers. The U.S., he said, needed to fill a projected deficit of 500,000 electricians in the next eight years. The country needed to reemphasize vocational training in high school and in community colleges. And he said Microsoft hoped to work with unions to help improve apprenticeship opportunities for those who wanted to train for the field.\nThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion about AI\u2019s carbon footprint, although this is often misunderstood. In the U.S., the electricity used to train and run AI models often comes from renewable sources or carbon-free nuclear power. But the power demands of AI are sometimes now causing cloud computing companies to buy up so much renewable capacity that other industries are forced to rely on fossil fuel-based generation. What\u2019s more, the process of manufacturing computer chips for AI applications, as well as the manufacture of the concrete and steel that goes into building data centers, contribute significantly to the overall carbon footprint of AI technology. Microsoft is among the tech companies that have said their plans to be carbon neutral by 2030 have been thrown off course due to their expanding data center infrastructure.\nSmith said Microsoft was focused on investing in technologies that would enable it to produce lower emissions by 2030\u2014and was also investing heavily in technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, that actually remove carbon dioxide from the environment. He noted that this contrasted to some other technology companies that are relying more heavily on buying carbon offsetting credits to reach their net zero goals. (Smith didn\u2019t say it, but its competitor Meta has been criticized for leaning on carbon credits rather than taking steps to directly reduce the carbon footprint of its data centers.)\nIt's unclear if the AI industry will, like good old Captain Kirk, get the energy it needs to save its own enterprise. And it\u2019s not entirely clear that we, as citizens of Earth, should be rooting for them. What is clear, however, is that it\u2019s going to be a drama worth tuning in for.\nWith that, here\u2019s more AI news.\nJeremy Kahn\njeremy.kahn@fortune.com\n@jeremyakahn\n**Before we get the news: Last chance to join me in San Francisco next week for the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference!

Welcome to the Zscaler first-quarter 2025 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI will now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ashwin Kesireddy, Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Kesireddy\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Zscaler first-quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Jay Chaudry, Chairman and the CEO; Remo Canessa, CFO.\nPlease note we have posted our earnings release and a supplemental financial schedule to our investor relations website.

We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our filings with the SEC as well as in today's earnings release.\nI also want to inform you that we'll be attending the following conferences: UBS Global Technology and AI Conference in Scottsdale on December 4; Scotiabank Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on December 10; Barclays Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on December 11; Needham Growth Conference on January 9 and 10.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nStory Continues\nJay Chaudhry\nThank you, Ashwin. We delivered a strong Q1 with all metrics, once again, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Revenue grew 26% year over year, and bookings growth accelerated to over 30% driven by increasing customer commitments to our zero trust exchange platform and growing interest in our AI solutions.\nOur billings growth of 13% far exceeded the recent average growth rate of publicly traded legacy network security vendors by over 10 percentage points, demonstrating our continued market share gains in cybersecurity. We are making tremendous progress, executing on our go-to-market plans and driving innovations that our customers are relying on us for. With continued strong demand, I'm very pleased to increase our full-year billings and revenue guidance.\nQ1 was a solid quarter for profitability as well. With our operating discipline, we grew operating profit by 50% year over year and delivered new Q1 records for operating margin of 21%, and free cash flow margin of 46%. While many successful SaaS companies strive for Rule of 40 results, our revenue growth and free cash flow margin makes us a rare SaaS company that operates at Rule of 70 or better. This places us in the top handful of the 145 largest public SaaS companies.\nIn my scores of customer conversations. CXOs are prioritizing zero trust security and AI for their IT spending. We are fighting AI with AI. We recently delivered several AI innovations and are continuing to expand our AI portfolio in the following three areas of high customer interest. First, securing use of AI applications for faster and safer adoption of public and private AI applications. We enable customers to securely adopt public AI apps such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and GitHub Copilot with Zscaler for copilots.\nZscaler for copilots provides granular visibility to find and classify on-prem or cloud data, gives access control for only the right users to access data, limits copilots' discovery of data, fixes copilot misconfigurations, and enforces policies to stop sensitive data from leaking. Our industry-leading capabilities in this area are driving large customer wins.\nFor example, in a new logo win, a Global 2000 technology services customer purchased our AI-powered data protection solution, which accounted for 50% of the seven-figure ACV deal. Data protection enabled this customer to securely roll out Microsoft Copilot. The secure use of Office 365 was a huge opportunity for us, and I believe the secure use of Microsoft Copilot is a huge opportunity as well.\nIn addition to enabling secure adoption of copilots, we provide visibility and control into public AI apps used by employees, scores the risk level of AI apps, and store prompt queries for logging or auditing purposes. With the widespread adoption of public AI apps, we are seeing growing demand for their security.\nOur innovations are expanding beyond securing public AI apps to customers' private AI apps, including chatbots, LLM, and SLM models and influence engines. We're expanding the functionality of our inline proxy-based zero trust exchange with an LLM proxy to analyze prompt queries and results, to detect and prevent prompt injections and other malicious activities.\nSecond, AI-powered automated digital experience for operational efficiency and faster resolution of end-to-end user performance issues. Our already available automated digital experience products including ZDX Copilot are contributing to large deal wins. For example, in a seven-figure ACV upsell deal, a large healthcare provider doubled their ZIA subscription to 60,000 seats and purchased ZDX Advanced Plus, which includes ZDX Copilot for all 60,000 seats.\nThis customer plans to use ZDX Copilot to automate IT operations and reduce resolution time for service tickets. With this deal, this customer's annual spend more than doubled with us. We're taking ZDX Copilot to the next level with ZDX AI agent to automate root cause analysis, resulting in a further reduction in resolution time and provide automated recommendations to fix user performance issues.\nThird, AI-powered security products are better cyber and data protection and SecOps automation. We have delivered several AI-powered innovations for data and cyber protection such as automated data classification, GenAI-based image classification, zero-day vulnerability detection and prevention, AI-powered app segmentation, and ML-based IoT/OT device discovery.\nFor increased productivity and efficiency of security operations, we have introduced several innovations including Risk360 and unified vulnerability management by extending our zero trust platform with data fabric technology. We are developing other AI power innovations including breach prediction, threat hunting, and more.\nOur AI-powered solutions leverage a vast amount of proprietary enterprise data generated by 500 billion transactions per day, processed by our zero trust exchange. We will continue to leverage our data and combine it with new agent-based technologies to rapidly expand our AI portfolio. The combination of zero trust and AI is creating exciting new opportunities, which we are well positioned to capture with our large and expanding platform.\nMoving on, hackers are finding new ways to exploit the limitations of legacy castle-and-moat security to launch an increasing number of sophisticated attacks. Such attacks often start with exploitation of firewall or VPN architecture. These traditional security solutions enable threat actors to move laterally on the corporate network and compromise the entire organization. To make up for the flawed architecture, legacy security vendors are offering disjointed point products under the pretext of a platform. This increases cost and complexity for customers.\nA Fortune 50 retail customer recently told me that a legacy final vendor sold them a so-called platform. And when they tried to implement it, they found that it was nothing more than consolidated billings. Complexity is the enemy of security and resilience. No wonder so many enterprises are getting breached despite spending billions of dollars on so-called SASE security, which is nothing more than virtual firewalls and VPNs in the cloud.\nThe sooner organizations move away from these disjointed security solutions to zero trust, the sooner they will become secure and resilient. Zscaler customers, modernized, and future-proof the security with our platform for better security, operational simplicity, and cost reduction. Today, we proudly secured over 35% of Global 2000 and about 45% of the Fortune 500, and we're seeing more and more large enterprises adopt our platform.\nTo give you an example, in a new logo seven-figure ACV deal, a Global 2000 aerospace and defense company purchased ZIA for 100,000 users and workload protection for 5,000 workloads. This customer initiated a strategic shift towards the cloud-first architecture and chose Zscaler as their partner for their security transformation.\nAdditionally, we see significant opportunity for ZPA upsells. Let me share an example. An existing Fortune 500 insurance customer expanded the ZIA subscription from 45,000 to 70,000 users and purchased ZPA for all 70,000 users.\nIn addition to securing access to private applications, rapid M&A integration for faster time to value realization was a key objective for this customer. ZPA expedites M&A integration by securely providing zero trust access to applications for the acquired entity's employees without having to connect the networks of two companies. This is not possible with a firewall-based SASE solution. With this upsell, This. customer's annual spend with us almost doubled to over $5 million. We expect ZPA to continue to be one of our biggest growth drivers in fiscal '25.\nMoving on to data protection, at Zenith Live, we outline our broader vision of our data protection solution, where our customers are increasingly adopting. For example, in a seven-figure ACV deal, a Fortune 500 pharma company purchased our data protection solution for over 23,000 users to eliminate multiple-point products including legacy data loss prevention, insider threat management, email data security and more. This purchase is nearly doubled the annual spend of this customer with Zscaler.\nI'm thrilled with the innovations we are bringing to our data protection solution. For example, we recently introduced a unique offering, which combines the capabilities of ZPA with our cloud browser product to bring zero trust access to third-party suppliers and partners.\nTraditionally, third-party application access was addressed either by VDIs that are expensive and complex or by third-party enterprise browsers that require yet another agent to be deployed on the endpoint. Third-party enterprise browsers are complex to deploy and manage and their vulnerabilities are being exploited by attackers.\nOur solution uses standard browsers like Chrome and provides superior security while eliminating VDIs and third-party browsers. To give you a few examples, a Global 2000 IT services company for 20,000 users; a US-based shipping and packaging company for 7,000 users; a Global 2000 insurance company for over 5,000 users, each purchased our cloud browser solution to eliminate legacy third-party access products. We will continue to invest to accelerate innovations in this area.\nNext, our emerging products including ZDX, zero trust for branch and cloud, and AI analytics are increasingly contributing to our success. I'm excited to share that emerging products ARR is growing twice as fast as our cold products. Combined with our account-centric go-to-market motion, our emerging products are driving large seven-figure deals.\nLet me share two examples. First, in a seven-figure upsell deal, a Fortune 500 transportation customer purchased ZIA for workloads eliminating virtual firewalls from the cloud environments. This upsell drove approximately 40% increase in the annual spend of this existing $5 million-plus ARR customer. Driven by our continued innovations for workload protection and our account-centric go-to-market strategy, we are securing large workload footprints for increasing number of customers, which has accelerated workload protection ARR over the past couple of quarters.\nSecond, in a new logo seven-figure ACV win, a large US automotive supplier purchased our zero trust SD-WAN for all 45 of their branches and zero trust devices segmentation for their 37 factories. A combination of zero trust SD-WAN with zero trust device segmentation will eliminate lateral threat movement among branches and factories, which is not possible to achieve with traditional SD-WAN. I believe with our solutions, we will accelerate the decline of North-South and East-West firewalls. This deal is an example of a global system integrator or GSI working closely with Zscaler to transform customers' legacy networks and security to zero trust architecture.\nNext, in the federal vertical, we added a new cabinet-level agency this quarter, and now we proudly serve 14 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies, including the DoD. Federal agencies are adopting the Zscaler platform to improve their security posture and reduce cost and complexity by eliminating firewalls and VPNs. Having landed these cabinet-level agencies, we see significant upsell opportunities to grow ARR over time.\nWe are also continuing expansion into other federal agencies. For example, in a new logo win, a large federal agency purchased ZPA and ZDX for 22,000 users in a seven-figure ACV deal. Government investigations by multiple countries including Australia, the European Union, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States concluded that nation state fiber attackers are successfully breaching the moat created by firewall-based solutions, and as a result, these governments are planning to adopt zero trust architecture. We see this as a huge opportunity, and we will leverage our success in US federal to grow our business in these and other countries.\nNext, let me share a few highlights of the progress we're making to up-level our go-to-market engine. I am pleased to share that we're making solid progress on hiring and attrition plans. We had a strong quarter of hiring highly experienced, quota-carrying account executives and had lower attrition. We expect these trends to continue in Q2, strengthening our sales capacity heading into the second half of fiscal '25.\nLast year, we made the strategic decision to shift our sales motion from opportunity-based selling to account-centric selling. Our CRO, Mike Rich, and his team are executing on this strategy, and we're already seeing stronger customer engagement, higher-quality pipeline, better close rates, and more business with customers. Strong customer engagement and sales execution contributed to over 20% year-over-year growth in unscheduled billings in Q1. As a reminder, unscheduled billings is comprised of new upsell and renewal billings.\nWe also grew $1 million-plus ARR customers by 25% year over year to 585. We ended Q1 with over 65 customers spending $5 million-plus annually with us.\nMoving on to the channel, we are working closely with our strategic partners including GSIs, strategic national and regional partners, and hyperscalers to drive faster value realization for customers, and increasing number of strategic partners are embedding Zscaler's platform in their solutions for their customers. Our joint partner offerings are expanding beyond ZIA, ZPA, and ZDX to now include our emerging products.\nOverall with strong execution in our account-centric sales motion, we expect to continue to grow the number of $1 million-plus and $5 million-plus customers at a strong pace. With a more mature pipeline, a stronger sales team, and growing partner engagements, I believe we remain on track to increase sales productivity and achieve strong growth.\nIn conclusion, our expanding portfolio that combines the power of zero trust and AI is resonating with customers. Our customer engagements are getting stronger as demonstrated by our net promoter score or NPS of over 70, which is well over 2x the SaaS company average. I'm proud of the progress we made in our go to market initiatives this quarter, and we will continue to make further progress towards achieving our next goal of $5 billion in ARR.\nNow I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa\nThank you, Jay. Our Q1 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $628 million, up 26% year over year and up 6% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 54% of revenue; EMEA was 30%; and APJ was 16%.\nOur total calculated billings in Q1 grew 13% year over year to $517 million. As Jay mentioned, our unscheduled billings comprised of new upsell and renewal billings grew over 20% year over year. Our calculated current billings grew 12% year over year.\nOur remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 26% from a year ago to $4.411 billion. Current RPO was approximately 49% of the total RPO.\nWe ended Q1 with 585 customers with over $1 million in ARR and 3,165 customers with over $100,000 in ARR. This continued strong growth of large customers speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation journeys.\nOur 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 114%. While good for our business, our increased success in selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start, and faster up sales within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. There could be variability in this metric on a quarterly basis due to the factors I just mentioned.\nTurning to the rest of our Q1 financial performance, total gross margin of 80.6% compares to 80.7% in the year-ago quarter. Our total operating expenses increased 5% sequentially and 19% year over year to $372 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model with operating margin of approximately 21%, an increase of about 330 basis points year over year.\nOur free cash flow margin was 46%, including data center CapEx of approximately 3% of revenue. We ended the quarter with over $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.\nNow let me provide our guidance for Q2 and full-year fiscal 2025. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $633 million to $635 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 21%, gross margins of approximately 80%.\nI would like to remind investors that we are introducing new products that are experiencing strong growth and are optimized for faster go-to-market rather than margins. This will continue to influence our gross margins. We plan to optimize new products for margins over time as they scale.\nOperating profit in the range of $126 million to $128 million. Net other income of $18 million. Earnings per share in the range of $0.68 to $0.69, assuming a 23% tax rate and 163 million fully diluted shares.\nFor the full-year fiscal 2025, we expect billings in the range of $3.124 billion to $3.149 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 19% to 20%. We expect our first-half mix to be approximately 39.3% to 39.5% of our full-year billings guide.\nRevenue in the range of $2.623 billion to $2.643 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 21% to 22%. Operating profit in the range of $549 million to $559 million. Earnings per share in the range of $2.94 to $2.99, assuming a 23% tax rate and approximately 164 million fully diluted shares.\nWe expect our free cash flow margin to be approximately 23.5% to 24%. We expect our data center CapEx to be approximately 3 points higher as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 2024 as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we'll invest aggressively to position us for long-term growth and profitability.\nOn a personal note, I'd like to share that after eight amazing years, I have decided to retire as Chief Financial Officer of Zscaler. It has been my greatest pleasure to be a part of Zscaler's journey from less than $250 million to over $2.5 billion in ARR. I'd like to thank Jay for his confidence in me. It has been a true partnership which for me personally has been very special.\nI'd also like to thank the employees of Zscaler and our Board of Directors for their support through the years and also thank our customers, partners, investors, and analysts. I am confident that Zscaler will continue to shape the next several decades of cybersecurity with its zero trust exchange platform. I look forward to following Zscaler's progress.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jake.\nJay Chaudhry\nI want to personally thank Remo for all his contributions to Zscaler. Remo has been a friend and a trusted business partner whose wisdom and judgment helped us make many critical decisions as we scaled our business at an unprecedented pace. He will be dearly missed. Remo will remain as CFO until his successor is appointed.\nWith that, operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. And at this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nSaket Kalia, Barclays.\nSaket Kalia\nOkay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. And first off, Remo, congrats on your retirement. Heck of a run at Zscaler and all the companies before this as well.\nRemo Canessa\nThank you, Saket. I appreciate that.\nSaket Kalia\nAbsolutely. Jay, maybe for you. Thanks for the detail on the unscheduled billings growth of 20% this quarter. Can you just maybe talk about how that did versus your expectation or maybe versus last quarter for some context? And as you look forward, do you still feel confident in sort of the accelerated billings growth as that contracted non-cancelable billings pool grows and normalizes back to what it was historically?\nRemo Canessa\nSo I'll start. The 20% growth is what we expected and actually exceed our expectations also. As we talked about, the scheduled contracted billings is 7% in the first half and 23% in the second half. So we do expect the unscheduled billings to be 20%-plus also in the second half as we talked about on the last call.\nJay Chaudhry\nGood. And in addition to that, let me add a few comments. Our Q1 was very strong. There are three factors that I believe will keep on helping us the second half. One, we are seeing strong demand in the Zscaler platform, including solid signs of interest for AI security offerings we have that wasn't there before.\nTwo, we have a strong and growing pipeline. Three, our ramp sales capacity has strengthened, and we have lower sales attritions in Q1. So I feel very good about our guidance for the second half.\nOperator\nAndrew Nowinski, Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski\nThanks. Remo, sorry to hear you're retiring. It's certainly been a pleasure working with you over the last decade.\nI guess I'd like to ask you a question the data security. The ZDX Copilot certainly sounds like an interesting opportunity. Given your prior partnership with Microsoft and your ability to securely deliver traffic to Office 365, I would imagine Microsoft is supporting you in this endeavor. But just wondering maybe if you could provide some more color on how you're helping -- how they're helping you bring more customers, help more customers roll out Copilot, and whether you are seeing Zscaler beat Varonis in that space.\nJay Chaudhry\nThank you. Sure. It's a good question. Yeah. What we're building is essentially leveraging a lot of work we did with Microsoft over the years. We've done tons of integration, including integration with data discovery and classification, whether it's talking with OneDrive or SharePoint and others.\nWhat gives us unique advantage is that we are sitting in line for all the traffic for Office 365. We can also go what's known as outer band using API for some of the classification discovery and the like. But this is as big of an opportunity for us as it was actually for Office 365, maybe bigger in some ways.\nWe are here. The customers have already embraced Office 365. Customers are actually beginning to use Microsoft Copilot, and now they're concerned about their data and privacy as well. We're seeing real deals.\nI briefly mentioned during our earnings lease, a G2000 company, they wanted to secure Microsoft Copilot. So they did deal with us. This was a seven-figure deal, and it is really driven by our data protection solution that's AI-powered, which identifies and make sure only the right amount of data can be accessed by the right user when they're using Microsoft Copilot.\nSo while many companies out there will try to do AI security but not very many of them are sitting in the traffic path, they may be able to do one piece of it, but we can do both inline as well as data sitting [at us]. So I'm very excited for the opportunity, and you'll see more coming with us. We are already working with the field with many of the Microsoft organizations to make sure we help our customers as -- customers of the same common interest.\nOperator\nGabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges\nHi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Jay, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on ZPA being a particularly meaningful driver, of course, in FY25. Maybe just remind us, how far along do you think we are in the VPN replacement cycle? How is the competitive environment changing? And what are some of the catalysts that might call an enterprise to reevaluate their VPN and zero trust ZPA strategy now versus maybe, call it, during COVID? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry\nYeah, I thought VPNs will be gone a long time ago -- there are lots and lots of them sitting out there -- similar to we used to wonder how long will Blue Coat proxies be here. We're still discovering lots of them and replacing them. But the opportunity is not just VPN. VPN is the starting point. That's a kind of beach head for us.\nWe are the entire inbound [DMC] that replaces the whole stack starting with load balancers, DDoS protection, external firewalls, VPN, all that kind of stuff. So that's a big opportunity. And the next phase of this opportunity ends up being zero trust segmentation out there -- so the three-phase VPN replacement, entire inbound DMC, and segmentation with zero trust.\nIf you look at what we've done with ZPA in terms of our numbers, it's a remarkable growth. At the time of the IPO, ZPA was about a single-digit percent of new and upsell business. Today, ZPA is over 40% of the mix of new and upsell, generated by ZIA and ZPA combined. I believe it's a matter of time when all of our customers will buy ZIA, ZPA, and ZDX for every employee. That's where our customers are headed.\nWe see more and more wins out there. And the so-called competition is still trying to spin up virtual VPN in the cloud and garner zero trust. So we think we have a big advantage in this area for quite some time.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat, thanks so much. So much information you've shared. Remo, fantastic run. Congrats. And nice strong booking start to the year, guys.\nJay, I was surprised to hear you compared your growth this quarter to that of the firewall players out there just given how differentiated you are. And some of those folks are talking about significant hardware refresh opportunities ahead as they have boxes that go end of life. If you look backwards, to what extent are those events, opportunities for Zscaler to go in and totally re-architect and transform and displace a set of branch firewalls, for example, and bring them onto your platform? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry\nYes. I agree with your statement. I was wondering should we be ever talk about comparing our billings growth to firewalls. Sure, but the delta was so big that we thought it's worth highlighting it.\nBut moving on to the other question you had about the fresh next year. When people used to ask me three years ago, are you replacing firewalls directly?, and I would say, no, we're not focused in firewalls -- but where we are sitting today, firewall refresh is a good opportunity for us. And we're planning to target customers with our cost takeout programs.\nTill about a year ago, we had limited impact on firewalls. But now, with a combination of our zero trust SD-WAN and zero trust device segmentation, we're able to replace most of the firewalls, North-South firewalls, East-West firewalls, in data center, in branches, as well -- in the cloud as well.\nSo I'm seeing tremendous customer interest to reduce or eliminate firewalls with our platform. So it's a good opportunity that we pursue.\nBrad Zelnick\nThank you. If I could just sneak in a quick follow-up, I don't know for you or Remo, but 30%-plus bookings growth, that is really strong. I think by my math, current bookings using cRPO even is strong as well. So it's not as if this is driven by duration.\nCan you maybe unpack for us just to help us to understand -- I understand the scheduled versus unscheduled billings dynamic, but we're looking at a pretty significant delta, and I just -- I feel like that bookings number is so strong it's worth highlighting and maybe just drilling into a bit for everyone. Thank you so much again.\nRemo Canessa\nYeah. It's a great number, Brad. 30% bookings growth, we're really proud of that. One thing to call out is that our unscheduled billings of 20%-plus growth basically both in the first half and second half, is helping that. But 30% bookings growth is, again, a really good number.\ncRPO -- strong growth in cRPO at 22%. RPO growth year over year at 26%. So all good metrics. And again, we're well-positioned with our customers. Our new and upsell is 65%, with upsell in Q1. Again, selling into accounts with the new go-to-market organization is taking hold. A lot of good things really happening for Zscaler are going into the second half -- into Q2 and also the second half of this year.\nOperator\nMike Cikos, Needham.\nMike Cikos\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. And I just really wanted to come back to the 20%-plus year-to-year unscheduled billings in the quarter. So congrats on that.\nI just wanted to see, can you tie that into the disclosure that we have today on that emerging products ARR? Is most of that unscheduled billings growth being sustained by those emerging products to see or hear that that ARR base is growing twice as fast as core, wanted to get some more color around if that's the driver and which products would that emerging products classes is seeing the most traction. Anything that would be incremental. Thank you very much, guys.\nRemo Canessa\nYeah, it's -- Mike, it's across the board. It's both emerging products as well as our core products. The emerging products include AI, workload protection, ZDX, and our brand solutions. ZDX is doing very well. But as we called out, also workloads is doing well for us.\nGoing forward, we made the comments that we'd be in the mid-20s percentage of new and upsell for the emerging products, and we still feel that. But to answer your question, it's across the board, our entire platform.\nJay Chaudhry\nYeah, maybe I can add a couple more comments about it. Yeah, the ARR -- emerging products ARR growing at 2x for core products; we're very excited about it.\nSo what's driving it? The branch is one part of it. I highlighted some of the deals for the branch. We talked about a seven-figure ACV deal for the branch for this automotive suppliers. We had zero trust SD-WAN securing 45 branches. We have Airgap doing zero trust segmentation of devices for 37 branches.\nSo that thing is taking all -- we believe, this is going to disrupt the SD-WAN, which enables lateral threat movement [transfer] attacks.\nI was especially pleased with the progress we're making on cloud workload protection. We have been selling workload protection. We did a great seven-figure deal in workload that is very interesting because a lot of these customers in the past have started small with us early on in smaller footprints.\nNow they're expanding those footprints with bigger deals, and that's what's going to accelerate our opportunity here. And then, there'll be zero trust workload segmentation the next opportunity. That's why we are excited because the only competition in the workload space for us for communication is old-school firewalls, and we're excited.\nOperator\nIttai Kidron, Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron\nThanks. And Remo -- so congratulations, and enjoy retirement. You earned it.\nA couple small ones for me. First of all, if I may, Remo, your last earnings call, you gave an ARR number and an ARR target for the end of the fiscal year. I was wondering if you can give us an update on ARR here now and the target for year-end.\nAnd then, on the second thing, on the emerging products, can you remind us what are the two, three biggest pieces within the emerging products category? Number one. But number two, also, what percent of new business activity do they represent for you right here, right now? Just trying to get a better sense of the change in mix there contribution-wise. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa\nI'll start then let Jay finish up. So our ARR target for the end of the year is $3 billion. And so we are on track for that $3 billion. Net retention rate is 114%, which, again, we think is outstanding. As we talked about -- that net retention rate is influenced with customers buying more upfront, but because of the new emerging products and the strength of new emerging products, that has a positive effect to that.\nRelated to what makes up the large part of emerging products, I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry\nYeah. Let me expand upon that. You can put them in a few buckets. ZDX started out; it has done very well. It's the biggest piece of it. Zero trust branch started out the branch connector group with our zero trust appliance, zero trust SD-WAN. It's a great area for us. Zero trust for workloads in the cloud, I shared a couple of examples, good opportunities.\nAnd now, the AI products is becoming actually pretty good area for us as well. So we are excited. In the past, we had talked about a part of AI products called AI analytics. This solution bundle was up 90% year over year. It's coming from a small base, but we're very pleased with the traction of the various emerging products are taking.\nRemo Canessa\nIn the new business and upsell opportunity, as we called out, we expect it to be in the mid-20% range, up from, I believe it was 22% last year. So we do see emerging products increasing in strength as we go forward.\nOperator\nRob Owens, Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens\nYeah. Thanks for taking my question. And I guess while I have the opportunity I'll pick on Remo and something he said because -- Remo, in your prepared remarks, you talked about ongoing customer scrutiny on large deals. And I don't know if that's just a general economic comment or there's something else coloring your opinion.\nA lot of the script was around adding AI in some of these transformational solutions that you guys are rolling out. Just curious if there's something else that might be lending to longer sales cycles as deals are getting bigger or if that was just more of a general economic comment. Thanks.\nRemo Canessa\nYeah. Rob, it was just a general economic comment, which basically we haven't really seen any change for a while.\nJay Chaudhry\nYes. But that, in ways, helps us. We are seeing interest in cyber -- especially in cyber that can really reduce the chance of ransomware attacks and the like. So that's where zero trust comes in. And then, the CIO often will say, and that hasn't changed, I like just cyber method, but if you can reduce my cost and complexity, doubly motivated.\nSo we really have combined the need for zero trust, and now AI becomes a further catalyst with cost and complexity reduction, which is helping us because most companies can't do cost reduction. A legacy firewall vendor is not going to cannibalize that large installed base of firewalls; we can.\nOperator\nBrian Essex, JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Remo, congratulations. We're certainly going to miss working with you.\nMaybe I wanted to hit on the SecOps side of the equation. Maybe, Jay, can you help us understand where we are in terms of progress with Avalor? And I noticed in the press release, you noted that you surpassed 0.5 trillion daily transactions, which is huge. How are your customers evaluating your ability to scale over the volume of data and traffic that you have, given all the changes we're seeing in the SecOps side of the market in the current environment? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry\nSecOps market is ready for disruption. It's a big market. We had taken a very thoughtful approach of starting by building the data fabric so that all queries and all the stuff doesn't need to come to the massive data lake, which can take forever. So Avalor acquisition has done that for us.\nNow building upon Avalor, we had done a few things already that are in the market. We started with Risk360 that's powered by the back-end to Avalor. We have unified vulnerability management that actually helps customers make sure they can properly prioritize vulnerabilities in that space. And then, running on the same platform, some of the digital experience offerings are getting bigger and better as well.\nIn the SecOps, the biggest thing we're doing that others can easily do is essentially scoring and prioritization of what needs to be done. But the next phase that will be powered will be the products we're building that's called breach prediction and threat hunting. There they're working with some of the early-stage design, and customers are seeing some very good results.\nSo what the point we want to make was you can go and build technology. But if you don't have the kind of private enterprise data you need, you can't do much with it. Let me contrast it. ChatGPT took the public data off the whole world, trained it on LLMs. They're able to do it well, but the logs are private.\nZscaler, having those logs available, we can actually train the staff by apply -- but based on the collected learning, this thing can be applied to a specific customer so each customer gets benefit. So we are increasing our investment in this area. And over time, you're going to start seeing some more meaningful results in this area.\nOperator\nJoel Fishbin, Truist.\nJoel Fishbein\nThanks for taking the question. Remo, big shoes to fill, and you'll be sorely missed.\nJay, you talked a little bit about the public sector and the US federal. Just curious if there's been any update on DoD and Thunderdome and any of the big projects there? They've been looking at doing a revitalization, and you seem to be primed for that. We'd love to hear where that stands.\nJay Chaudhry\nSo we continue to gain share in federal market across the board. One of the things I'm proud of is now we reached 14 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies as our customers. Across defense too, we have a number of initiatives. We have talked about some of them in the past.\nWe think we have very, very big opportunity out there. And with the new administration coming on board, we are all reading about the push for cost reduction. I believe that's a positive for us for our federal business. This is because we reduce cost and complexity.\nWe eliminate North-South, East-West firewalls, VPN, NAC, segmentation, all of those kind of products. So I'm excited about the federal opportunities. And it's not just the US. We're taking the same kind of solutions to some of the Western friendly, NATO friendly countries as well.\nOperator\nFatima Boolani, Citi.\nFatima Boolani\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I appreciate it. And, Remo, congratulations on an illustrious career.\nI wanted to ask you a question with regards to the updated billings guidance and some of the implied second-quarter billings based on some of the seasonality commentary you shared, Remo.\nIs there anything that we should think about vis-\u00e0-vis transactions that maybe landed early? Just trying to get a better sense of, hey, first quarter was really strong out of the gate, certainly relative to expectations. But why would we see some of that pare down in the second quarter? If you can give us some color around that. Thank you so much.\nRemo Canessa\nYeah. Our guide for the second quarter for billings is actually up. The 39.3% to 39.5% would indicate that for the second quarter.\nThe key thing is that we had a great first quarter. And if you take a look, we're passing the beat for the entire year. Really, fundamentally, nothing's changed what we talked about on the prior call. The key dynamic which is recurring is the scheduled billings at 7% in the first half and 23% in the second half. So nothing's really fundamentally changed.\nWhat I can say is that our pipeline supports our guidance. What I can say also is that hiring has been very good in our sales organization. Attrition is down. The go-to-market organization really is becoming very, very strong.\nSo as we go forward, it will become a more important part to Zscaler. So the second half basically, as we talked about -- and you have our guidance. We brought up guidance for the full year, and we feel comfortable with that.\nJay Chaudhry\nAbsolutely. Also, the same thing. The go-to-market execution of Mike Rich, the leadership team has been outstanding.\nOperator\nShrenik Kothari, Baird.\nShrenik Kothari\nHey. Congrats on the retirement, Remo. Great working with you, and good luck for the next chapter. Thanks for taking my questions.\nSo the shift to account-centric selling, of course, is yielding benefits already, Jay, you mentioned, with the pipeline quality. Just a follow-up to Brad's question on the bookings growth. And say, Remo and Jay, you mentioned about the partnership with GSIs facilitating significant deal wins. You mentioned about the seven-figure SD-WAN.\nCan you just help provide some more quantifiable color in terms of incremental ARR tied to GSI-led deals? And any more examples that highlight success with GSI, if that is leading to larger, bigger deals, or also longer sales cycles? And how should we think about the billings going forward?\nJay Chaudhry\nRight. Very good question. We are actually seeing increasing contribution of GSIs, especially in large accounts. I highlighted two deals, actually, this time that are driven by GSIs as strong partners. An auto supply parts company, this was a combination of zero trust segmentation and zero trust branch, eliminating the need for firewalls in lots and lots of factories and branches. They also -- GSI also helped us with G2K services company, where we sold protection for Microsoft and copilot type of stuff.\nI think the difference we're seeing is that GSIs are now working more closely with customers starting the early stage. And they are standardizing on some of our solutions. It used to be ZIA, ZPA, ZDX. Now, their standard solutions are including emerging products as well. So good momentum.\nAnd also, think of it, when we talk about eliminating a bunch of products, generally, those products end up being what? They are firewalls; they're VPN; they're SD-WANs; they're NAC or VDIs, they're device segmentation. It creates an opportunity for GSI partners to get services to replace -- take those products out.\nOver time, we'll start giving you more and more data about it. But I'll say, we are very pleased with the results, and this is because of the leadership we added to drive GSI that's making a big difference.\nOperator\nMatt Hedberg, RBC.\nMatthew Hedberg\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Lots of really good things to think about on this quarter.\nI guess I wanted to go back to the data protection solution. It seems like it's really contributing to large deals. And it's not the first time you've talked about It. I looked back; I think in Q4 of '23, fiscal '23, you talked about approaching [15] million of ARR. I think, at the time, it was growing about 60%.\nAny update on the scale of that business? I think it was about maybe about 12% of ARR back then. I have to imagine, it's been growing faster than the base business, but that feels like it's a really, really material contributor to new and emerging product growth.\nJay Chaudhry\nYes, data protection keeps on growing faster than our overall business. We are doing some big deals. I think with the emergence of AI, one of the biggest thing that's going to really help drive data protection is AI, because companies are worried about their data leaking out there as they start using more and more public AI services like ChatGPT, even Copilot falls under that area. And then, they'll be worried about private AI applications that our customers are building too.\nSo we have built probably the most comprehensive platform for data protection, not just inline data and end-point data for SaaS applications, data in the cloud with DSP around the world, and even data security for emails as well. I think you keep on seeing us.\nAnd the other comment I made was, as all large data protection exfiltration happens for Internet, we are sitting in line; we are naturally there. We're doing SSL/TLS inspection. So it's natural for expect to grow this business, and we're doing a good job with it.\nOperator\nRoger Boyd, UBS.\nRoger Boyd\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. And, Remo, sad to see you go, but I'll echo my congrats on your retirement there. It's been a pleasure.\nJay, just to follow up on data security, it seems like you're having a lot of traction upselling that data security portfolio. But I'm wondering to what extent that you've seen that holistic view that really only inline vendors can do start to influence new ZPA, ZIA deals and how big of a competitive differentiator you see that being going forward?\nJay Chaudhry\nData protection, majority of the time, it comes with ZIA, ZPA. It's such a large installed base. Our customers started on data protection side and had none or small data protection. So it's easy and natural for us to start that way.\nWe are seeing some of the customers who -- some of the prospects starting with interest on the data protection side as well. Those numbers are relatively small. The biggest products that are actually helping us with new logos without ZIA, ZPA are actually products like Airgap, zero trust device segmentation, or Avalor's Unified Vulnerability Management.\nLook, a company like Zscaler that has a large platform, we can sell a lot in installed base. We can also sell a lot of the new logo opportunities because of the big market for us there. That's why we don't really push for one or the other. We think both are important for us, and we are doing well in both areas.\nOperator\nThank you. And with that, I would now like to turn it back over to Jay Chaudhry for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry\nGreat. Well, thank you all for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you in one of the many conferences that we'll be participating in. See you then. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect and everyone, have a great day.\nView Comments"

The latest country to embrace it is Japan. According to\u00a0The Japan Times,\u00a0private-sector businesses in the country have begun embracing related information technologies to enhance operational efficiency. GenAI search services, in particular, are proving\u00a0useful for searching corporate databases.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI News Updates This Weekend\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nThe news states how Lion, a leading Japanese consumer goods company, has built a generative AI-powered search system that allows its researchers to search through research reports and conference materials stored in the company\u2019s database efficiently.\n\u201cTo drive innovation, we need a system that allows researchers to have quick access to technical knowledge when they need it\u201d.\nYamaoka revealed that the time required to locate a desired document has been reduced to an average of one-fifth of that with conventional search systems. The company further states that GenAI is proving beneficial not only for recruits and young employees but also for those transitioning to new workplaces, allowing them to \u201csystematically acquire knowledge in unfamiliar fields\u201d. Even though GenAI comes with its fair share of challenges such as hallucinations and copyright concerns, it also stands to benefit the corporate world in the long run.\nIn other news, one popular AI chatbot is seemingly facing a technical glitch and preventing it from saying one name in particular: David Mayer. If there is one name in the AI realm that everyone knows about, it\u2019s ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence chatbot has been trained on large amounts of data to create content, including voices, music, pictures, and videos. However, it was recently unearthed by a Reddit user that the AI chatbot is unable to say David Mayer.\nAccording to AI expert Justine Moore, a plausible scenario is that someone named David Mayer went out of his way to remove his presence from the internet. For example, strict privacy laws in the European Union allow citizens to file \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +16%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 8.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -78.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +20.7%. This estimate has changed +10.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.36 indicates a change of +16.8% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +22.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.93 billion and $4.73 billion estimates indicate +28.5% and +20.4% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $1.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $982.26 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.84%. The EPS surprise was +14.81%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Have you evaluated the performance of CrowdStrike Holdings' (CRWD) international operations during the quarter that concluded in October 2024? Considering the extensive worldwide presence of this cloud-based security company, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial resilience and potential for growth.\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\nUpon examining CRWD's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\nFor the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $1.01 billion, experiencing an increase of 28.5% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of CRWD's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations.\nA Closer Look at CRWD's Revenue Streams Abroad\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa accounted for 15.90% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $160.57 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +2.08%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $157.3 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe, Middle East, and Africa contributed $148.85 million (15.44%) and $119.16 million (15.16%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Other International contributed $63.29 million in revenue, making up 6.27% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $62.13 million, this meant a surprise of +1.87%. Looking back, Other International contributed $61.75 million, or 6.41%, in the previous quarter, and $47.52 million, or 6.05%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nOf the total revenue, $102.84 million came from Asia Pacific during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 10.18%. This represented a surprise of -1.89% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $104.82 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $98.27 million, or 10.20%, and $81.46 million, or 10.36%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nStory Continues\nAnticipated Revenues in Overseas Markets\nIt is projected by analysts on Wall Street that CrowdStrike will post revenues of $1.03 billion for the ongoing fiscal quarter, an increase of 22.3% from the year-ago quarter. The expected contributions from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Other International and Asia Pacific to this revenue are 16.2%, 6.4% and 10.7%, translating into $167.41 million, $65.97 million and $110.85 million, respectively.\nFor the full year, the company is projected to achieve a total revenue of $3.93 billion, which signifies a rise of 28.5% from the last year. The share of this revenue from various regions is expected to be: Europe, Middle East, and Africa at 15.6% ($613.74 million), Other International at 6.2% ($242.11 million) and Asia Pacific at 10.4% ($407.54 million).\nKey Takeaways\nThe dependency of CrowdStrike on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\nIn an era of growing international ties and escalating geopolitical disputes, financial analysts on Wall Street pay keen attention to these developments to fine-tune their earnings estimations for businesses operating across borders. It's important to note, however, that a range of additional variables, like a company's local market status, also play a crucial role in shaping these forecasts.\nAt Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating mechanism, demonstrates a notable performance history confirmed through external audits. It effectively utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions to act as a predictor of a stock's price performance in the near term.\nCurrently, CrowdStrike holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signifying its potential to match the overall market's performance in the forthcoming period.

In the same interval, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has registered an increase of 0.1%. Over the past three months, the company's shares saw an increase of 40.4%, while the S&P 500 increased by 8.2%. In comparison, the sector experienced an increase of 6.5% during this timeframe.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading cybersecurity software company. Following a long period of outsized gains, shares fell 29.5% in the quarter after a software glitch caused a global Microsoft outage in July. Despite the outage, the company delivered solid second quarter results that exceeded the high end of expectations across all key metrics. Management called out several delayed deals but noted that they remained in the pipeline and should close in coming quarters. Increased scrutiny and the implementation of new incentives, including discounts and free products and flexibility on billings, will likely negatively impact bookings and revenue growth over the near term. While the range of outcomes on the implications of the outage on customer retention and willingness to expand with CrowdStrike remains wider than usual, leading us to reduce our position, we believe that the fact that the incident was not due to a breach, the company\u2019s competitively advantaged product, its transparent and rapid response, and the new procedures it had put in place, should help it retain its customers and grow wallet share over time.\"\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
