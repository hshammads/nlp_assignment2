(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nUS-China chip wars have been dominating headlines in the AI universe for the past few weeks. After the US announced fresh curbs on export of advanced AI chips to China, the Asian country responded by announcing that it had banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony that have widespread military applications. Some of the banned minerals like gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells. Others, like antimony, are used in bullets and other weaponry, while graphite is the largest component by volume of electric vehicle batteries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAccording to news agency Reuters, the move has sparked fresh concern that Beijing could next target other critical minerals, including those with even broader usage such as nickel or cobalt. China has also blocked some purchases from chipmaker Micron citing security concerns. There are also reports that chipmaker Intel would be the next target following comments from the Cybersecurity Association of China that the American firm has constantly harmed the country's national security and interests and that its products sold in China should be subject to a security review.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "President-elect Donald Trump is making it clear he doesn't intend to ease up on the nation's technology giants once he is back in the Oval Office.\nThe latest sign came Wednesday when he said he would nominate Gail Slater, an aide to Vice President-elect JD Vance, to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division.\n\"Big Tech has run wild for years,\" Trump said in a statement announcing the appointment on his Truth Social platform, \"stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!\"\n\"I was proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail\u2019s leadership,\" he added.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump attends a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket, in Brownsville, Texas, on Nov. 19 . Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nThe appointment and comments from the president-elect offer a new signal that his administration could press forward with a series of investigations and lawsuits challenging the way the biggest companies in the technology industry, including Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), maintain their dominance.\nIt was Trump\u2019s first administration that initially sued Google over antitrust concerns, which led to a ruling by a district court judge in August that the tech giant illegally monopolized the search engine market. The DOJ has asked a judge to consider breaking up the company in a separate phase of the trial that won't wrap up until 2025.\nIt was also during Trump\u2019s first administration that the Federal Trade Commission sought to unwind Meta\u2019s (META) acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in a case set for trial in April. Trump's first administration also launched an antitrust investigation into Apple (APPL), leading the Biden administration to sue the iPhone maker earlier this year.\nAnother ominous sign for Big Tech is that last month Trump nominated Brendan Carr as Federal Communications Commission chair.\nJust days before he got that chairmanship appointment, Carr sent letters to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook predicting \"broad ranging actions to restore Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights\" once Trump takes office.\nBrendan Carr, Trump's pick to be FCC boss. Photo: Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nThat might include \"a review of your companies\u2019 activities as well as third-party organizations and groups that have acted to curtail those rights,\" according to a copy of the letter Carr posted to X.\nThe appointment of Slater to run the DOJ's antitrust division elevates a figure who was a tech policy adviser at the National Economic Council during Trump\u2019s first term. She previously spent a decade at the Federal Trade Commission, including as an adviser to former Democratic FTC commissioner Julie Brill during President Barack Obama's administration.\nStory Continues\nThe FTC shares responsibility with the DOJ for enforcing the nation's antitrust laws.\nIn the private sector, Slater held positions at Fox Corp. and Roku. She also worked for the since-dismantled lobbying organization Internet Association, which advocated for the country's most powerful tech firms.\nThe companies included Amazon (AMZN), Airbnb (ABNB), Facebook (META), Google, eBay (EBAY), Microsoft (MSFT), Spotify (SPOT), Uber (UBER), X, and Zillow (Z).\nSlater's boss, Vance, has expressed admiration for the approach of FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has gained a reputation for aggressively pursuing lawsuits and investigations targeting the biggest tech giants.\nLina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that Khan had launched a wide-ranging antitrust investigation into Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.\nIt is still not known whether Trump will seek to replace Khan and with whom. Slater has acted as an adviser to the administration on that subject.\nThere is also no guarantee Khan\u2019s replacement will hold a similar point of view, or continue her pursuits.\n\u201cWe don't know who's going to succeed Lina Khan, but you can bet it's not going to be anyone with the philosophy of Lina Khan,\" said former FTC member and University of Baltimore Law School antitrust professor Robert Lande.\nTrump has sent some mixed messages about how far he wants to go to hold tech firms accountable.\nWhile campaigning, he was asked whether he supported a breakup of Google as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market. Trump suggested that Google\u2019s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet Inc. REUTERS/Carlos Barria \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview. The former president described Google\u2019s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nOn Wednesday, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said of Trump that \"in my conversations with him, he\u2019s definitely very focused on American competitiveness, particularly in technology, including AI.\"\nWhen asked at a New York Times DealBook summit in New York if Trump's election changes the dynamic for Google's antitrust case, he said, \"This is a DOJ case, and the case is already in court,\" noting that it started under Trump's first term.\n\"So I don\u2019t have any particular insights into that.\" The company, he added, will \"defend ourselves there.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Tech investors are girding for the latest development in TikTok\u2019s legal saga. Social media and search companies like Meta Platforms Inc. have a lot at stake, as does Oracle Corp., which counts TikTok as a big customer.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nKansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit\nNYC\u2019s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp\nAs Wars Rage, Cities Face a Dark New Era of Urban Destruction\nRiyadh Metro Partially Opens in Bid to Ease City\u2019s Traffic Jams\nThe US Court of Appeals in Washington is due to issue a ruling on whether to uphold or overturn a law that requires TikTok\u2019s China-based owner to sell the app by Jan. 19, or face a ban in the US. The ruling probably won\u2019t be the end of the drama, as any outcome would likely be appealed. But traders are watching every step carefully, with TikTok\u2019s more than 170 million US users and billions of dollars in advertising revenue top of mind.\nFor investors in companies like Instagram parent Meta, Google parent and YouTube owner Alphabet Inc., and smaller rivals like Pinterest Inc. and Snap Inc., a result that weakens TikTok would be a big positive. The company, owned by ByteDance Ltd., is used by about a third of US adults \u2014 and a majority of Americans under 30 \u2014 and is growing more rapidly than competitors, according to Pew Research Center surveys.\nUpholding the law would be a \u201cclear victory for Meta shares,\u201d according to Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. Consensus estimates have baked in TikTok competition through 2026, offering \u201call upside\u201d for Meta stock, Stucky said. Meta\u2019s Instagram features a TikTok rival product known as Reels.\nMeta, which is up more than 70% this year, hit an intraday record in Thursday morning trading.\nPinterest may also capture more user attention if TikTok were out of the picture, according to Stucky. It\u2019s been making a push into shoppable content, competing with similar efforts from TikTok and Instagram. TikTok said this week that it tripled its US shopping sales to more than $100 million on Black Friday.\nPinterest shares have had a volatile year, slumping in the summer after poor results before garnering some positive analyst attention a few months later. A weak sales forecast for the holiday quarter took that shine off, leaving the stock down 12% this year. Snap is also having a rough year, with a decline of more than 4% in early Thursday trading pushing the shares down 28% year-to-date.\nThere\u2019s also upside for Alphabet, though to a lesser extent, said Stucky. The main benefit would be via search, where Google faces a lot of competition \u2014 primarily from ChatGPT.\nStory Continues\nOn the flip side, if TikTok is ultimately banned in the US, it would be negative for Oracle, which provides the social media app with cloud infrastructure to store and process US user data. Oracle said in June that a ban would threaten its financial results, and Evercore ISI estimated that TikTok may account for as much as $800 million of annual sales. Shares in the software firm have been on a tear this year, rising almost 80%.\nFor traders and analysts, gaming out the various possibilities is a difficult task. The losing side in the upcoming ruling could appeal to the Supreme Court, delaying any final resolution. The re-election of Donald Trump \u2014 who has had a change of heart about TikTok and is now against a ban \u2014 also complicates matters.\nTD Cowen analyst Paul Gallant laid out three possibilities: The court upholds the entire TikTok ban statute; the court rejects the TikTok-specific ban but upholds the authority for the president to ban apps on national security grounds; the court rejects the entire statute as unconstitutional.\nThe most likely outcome is that the court upholds the ban, Gallant wrote, but he expects TikTok to survive anyway \u2014 with Trump potentially ordering a \u201cProject Texas-like monitoring arrangement and declaring TikTok to be officially divested and free to continue operating in the US.\u201d Project Texas was a plan introduced by TikTok several years ago to cordon off Americans\u2019 data from China with help from Oracle.\nBloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst Matthew Schettenhelm sees a 70% chance that TikTok loses the DC Circuit ruling, with the company then likely to make a last-ditch plea to the Supreme Court to pause the law\u2019s Jan. 19 deadline.\nThe justices could opt to take a case raising a consequential free speech question, likely putting it on a track for a decision in June, according to Schettenhelm. Still, he notes that TikTok would also need to convince five justices to freeze the Jan. 19 date, and sees this as \u201cpossible yet unlikely.\u201d\nOther legal maneuvering could also delay things well past that deadline, and Trump\u2019s involvement might affect the outcome in various ways, as laid out here by Bloomberg\u2019s Alexandra S. Levine. Another possibility is that the DC court comes up with a \u201ctechnical solution\u201d by ruling that the law violates the Constitution\u2019s prohibition against a so-called \u201cbill of attainder,\u201d according to Georgetown law professor Anupam Chander.\nAnd of course, there\u2019s always the possibility that TikTok could be acquired, which would change the landscape entirely as well \u2014 though ByteDance has said it won\u2019t sell its US TikTok business and there are probably few buyers that could handle such a large and potentially contentious acquisition.\nFor social media stocks, Oracle and the wider tech sector, whatever the court decides, it likely \u201cisn\u2019t going to be the end of the story,\u201d Stucky said.\nTop Tech Stories\nA potential split of Google\u2019s business is still under consideration, according to Teresa Ribera, the European Union\u2019s new competition chief, who also pledged to build bridges with incoming US President Donald Trump.\nIntel Corp., fresh off the abrupt departure of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, stuck with its current financial forecast during a presentation Wednesday while also saying it would keep a tight rein on capital spending.\nVietnam has ordered PDD Holdings Inc.\u2019s Temu to suspend sales in the country while it reviews the shopping app\u2019s registration, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported, becoming the latest government to apply pressure on the Chinese-owned e-commerce phenomenon.\nOpenAI is partnering with Anduril Industries Inc. to incorporate its artificial intelligence technology into the weapons maker\u2019s anti-drone systems, marking the AI developer\u2019s most significant push yet into the defense sector.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nPremarket\nMethode Electronics\nJohn Wiley\nPostmarket\nSamsara\nHP Enterprise\nGuidewire\nDocuSign\nGitlab\nUiPath\nSmartsheet\nHashiCorp\nAsana\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Stephen Kirkland.\n(Updates trading throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDubai\u2019s Alleged Crypto Scams Are Raking in Billions\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Tough factors may affect the use of nuclear energy in such projects, mainly the regulations of reactors and the supply of uranium.\nMeta's action is an example of rising energy demands in this sector as AI adoption gets faster.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against other AI stocks that will skyrocket.\nEnterprise AI is expected to Drive Earnings in 2025\nSome investors are heavily scrutinizing Big Tech\u2019s AI spending. Despite these hefty expenditures, Big Tech has been enjoying solid revenues and earnings growth. Yung-Yu Ma, CIO at BMO Wealth Management, recently joined\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to shed light on the overall AI sector outlook heading into 2024.\nMa believes that companies are increasing their investments in AI in anticipation of higher returns. He said that it makes sense that the market is less likely to be enthusiastic about this situation. Ma argued that while spending on AI is likely to increase, there is a certainty that the results will soon show, maybe by the end of 2025.\nHe added that the market will probably see healthy earnings growth in 2025. Spending is broadly going to drive these earnings, particularly AI and its different use cases such as data centers, electricity grids, and other infrastructure. He expects an overall growth in valuation and shared that Big Tech is extremely confident and committed to pouring investment into the sector.\nA Glance at Some Revolutionary AI Startups\n2024 has been quite a year for artificial intelligence. Existing startups like Anthropic and Databricks have been performing exceptionally well and transforming the industry.\nAnthropic is an AI safety and research company behind the OpenAI rival, Claude. On November 24, Anthropic extended its partnership with AWS, involving another $4 billion investment, bringing the total to $8 billion. The partnership also positions AWS as Anthropic\u2019s primary cloud and training partner. Keeping up with the partnership, on December 4, Anthropic began optimizing Claude models to be able to run on AWS Trainium 2.\nDatabricks, the data and AI company, is another AI startup crucial to the AI revolution. Some of the products by Databricks include data management solutions, data warehousing, real-time analytics, data sharing, and data governance. The company is expanding to new heights. On November 6, the company partnered with KT Corporation to boost data and AI innovation in Korea. Following the trend, on November 20, Databricks announced it saw 70% annualized growth in its French business and has launched a new office in central Paris.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with AI stocks that will skyrocket, we consulted media reports to shortlist stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well according to analysts and strategists. After consulting 10 similar rankings on the internet we examined the Street-High upside for each stock and picked the ones with the highest upside, as of December 3, 2024. Our list is in ascending order of the street high upside as of December 3, 2024. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment for each stock.\nStory Continues\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nMeta Platforms Inc (META): AI Innovations Driving Future Growth\nGil C / Shutterstock.com\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\nStreet High Upside as of December 3, 2024: 37%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 235\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is the technology conglomerate behind Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, with over 3 billion daily active users across all its platforms. Over the past few months, the company has leveraged its expertise in AI and augmented reality, having launched its debut AR glasses, Orion, and its mixed reality headset, Meta Quest 36, in September.\nThe company is using artificial intelligence to simplify daily tasks and help solve mission-critical tasks at a state level. On November 4, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) announced that it is making Llama available to government agencies in the United States. In addition to that, on November 20, the company introduced AI backgrounds and several other features for Messenger calling, also ensuring that its customers enjoy a more entertaining social media experience.\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has a solid business model with a prominent growth trajectory. The company is pioneering artificial intelligence and is expected to spend billions to support the goal. Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their high price target points to an upside of 37% from current levels.\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cWe are pleased to report that\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\nOverall, META ranks 10th on our list of AI stocks that will skyrocket. While we acknowledge the potential of META to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss.\nDuring an appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box Europe, Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, discussed the outlook for the artificial intelligence industry and regulation in the United States with Donald Trump set to become president.\nWhen asked if there is a bit of a gold rush regarding AI, Calkins agreed. He said that AI comes with significant concerns, particularly among CEOs. This is because AI has the potential to embarrass organizations or compromise sensitive data, which creates hesitation. \u201cWe are all looking for a safe way to take the first step with AI,\u201d he said.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nRegarding whether companies are panicking about using AI profitably, Calkins observed a cautious approach from most businesses, while large tech firms have been investing aggressively. \u201cIt\u2019s a calculated risk, and they should be doing it,\u201d he said, contrasting this with the restraint shown by smaller companies.\nTalking about regulation, Calkins revealed that the bottom line is that AI can be somewhat dangerous if misused, which underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks. He referenced the European AI Act as an example, explaining that regulation could focus on restricting how AI is used or limiting the types of data it can access.\nWith the Trump administration coming in, Calkins predicted a strong focus on competing with China in the tech space. He also mentioned Elon Musk\u2019s influence on Trump, stating that Musk\u2019s influence on the Trump administration is positive because he knows deeply about artificial intelligence.\nIn other recent news, Sam Altman has announced a special event titled \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d. Altman will be revealing a new model or feature every weekday for two weeks, posted Altman on X, formerly Twitter. Some new models and features that users have been predicting include AI video generator Sora, the complete version of the \"o1\" reasoning model, and better control over ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice feature.\n\u201cEach weekday, we will have a livestream with a launch or demo, some big ones and some stocking stuffers\u201d.\nWith OpenAI seemingly in holiday spirits, the series of reveals will be live-streamed starting December 5, continuing for the next twelve weekdays. It looks like a very merry Christmas for all the tech fans.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

It also said that it will evaluate if the company\u2019s latest AI chip can be used to pre-train its models like Apple Intelligence.\nThe company recently appeared in Amazon\u2019s AWS Reinvent conference, revealing its usage, and also endorsing Amazon as it competes with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud for AI dominance. Benoit Dupin, Apple\u2019s senior director of machine learning and AI, suggested that Apple would use Amazon\u2019s Trainium 2 chip to pretrain its proprietary models.\u00a0 AWS CEO Matt Garman also revealed that Apple had been an early adopter and beta-tester for the company\u2019s Trainium chips.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss.

According to Adobe Analytics, online spending has hit $10.8 billion in the US, and Generative AI chatbots drove a 1,800% surge in retail site traffic compared to 2023.

Digital retailers using generative AI and agents in their customer service experiences saw a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those who did not.\nIn other news, OpenAI\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, told the Financial Times that the company is considering introducing ads on its platform. She further revealed that the company had recently hired Kevin Weil, an executive from Instagram, who was well-suited to the task.\n\u201cThe good news with Kevin Weil at the wheel with product is that he came from Instagram.

The shift may send doubts about the profitability of its subscription-based model, raising concerns about potential \u201censhittification\u201d, as tech commentator and activist Cory Doctorow famously terms it, where user-focused features are compromised for advertiser-driven engagement and time optimization.\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s endeavors are so huge that its revenues don\u2019t manage to cover them.

Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nThe appointment and comments from the president-elect offer a new signal that his administration could press forward with a series of investigations and lawsuits challenging the way the biggest companies in the technology industry, including Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), maintain their dominance.\nIt was Trump\u2019s first administration that initially sued Google over antitrust concerns, which led to a ruling by a district court judge in August that the tech giant illegally monopolized the search engine market. The DOJ has asked a judge to consider breaking up the company in a separate phase of the trial that won't wrap up until 2025.\nIt was also during Trump\u2019s first administration that the Federal Trade Commission sought to unwind Meta\u2019s (META) acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in a case set for trial in April. Trump's first administration also launched an antitrust investigation into Apple (APPL), leading the Biden administration to sue the iPhone maker earlier this year.\nAnother ominous sign for Big Tech is that last month Trump nominated Brendan Carr as Federal Communications Commission chair.\nJust days before he got that chairmanship appointment, Carr sent letters to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook predicting \"broad ranging actions to restore Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights\" once Trump takes office.\nBrendan Carr, Trump's pick to be FCC boss.

She previously spent a decade at the Federal Trade Commission, including as an adviser to former Democratic FTC commissioner Julie Brill during President Barack Obama's administration.\nStory Continues\nThe FTC shares responsibility with the DOJ for enforcing the nation's antitrust laws.\nIn the private sector, Slater held positions at Fox Corp. and Roku. She also worked for the since-dismantled lobbying organization Internet Association, which advocated for the country's most powerful tech firms.\nThe companies included Amazon (AMZN), Airbnb (ABNB), Facebook (META), Google, eBay (EBAY), Microsoft (MSFT), Spotify (SPOT), Uber (UBER), X, and Zillow (Z).\nSlater's boss, Vance, has expressed admiration for the approach of FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has gained a reputation for aggressively pursuing lawsuits and investigations targeting the biggest tech giants.\nLina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that Khan had launched a wide-ranging antitrust investigation into Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.\nIt is still not known whether Trump will seek to replace Khan and with whom. Slater has acted as an adviser to the administration on that subject.\nThere is also no guarantee Khan\u2019s replacement will hold a similar point of view, or continue her pursuits.\n\u201cWe don't know who's going to succeed Lina Khan, but you can bet it's not going to be anyone with the philosophy of Lina Khan,\" said former FTC member and University of Baltimore Law School antitrust professor Robert Lande.\nTrump has sent some mixed messages about how far he wants to go to hold tech firms accountable.\nWhile campaigning, he was asked whether he supported a breakup of Google as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market. Trump suggested that Google\u2019s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet Inc. REUTERS/Carlos Barria \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview. The former president described Google\u2019s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nOn Wednesday, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said of Trump that \"in my conversations with him, he\u2019s definitely very focused on American competitiveness, particularly in technology, including AI.\"\nWhen asked at a New York Times DealBook summit in New York if Trump's election changes the dynamic for Google's antitrust case, he said, \"This is a DOJ case, and the case is already in court,\" noting that it started under Trump's first term.\n\"So I don\u2019t have any particular insights into that.\" The company, he added, will \"defend ourselves there.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "In a new interview with Wired this week, Apple CEO Tim Cook opened up about his relationship with the late Steve Jobs, sharing how the legendary founder\u2019s vision convinced him Apple would thrive, even when critics thought it was doomed.\n\u201cIf you remember, Michael Dell had said if he was the CEO, he would shut Apple down and just return whatever assets were left to the shareholders,\u201d Cook said. \u201cMichael just said what most everyone else thought.\u201d\nBut a conversation with Jobs in 1998 changed everything. \u201cWhen I came out to talk to Steve about working at Apple, it felt so alive and so different. He was passionate about the product, about Apple, and its purpose,\u201d Cook said. \u201cFrom that point, I never thought that Apple would be going out of business.\u201d\nCook would go on to join Apple, leaving a secure position at Compaq despite warnings from colleagues about Apple\u2019s precarious state. (Mind you, this was years before the iPod, iTunes, and iPhone came along, marking what many consider to be Apple's renaissance.) After Jobs\u2019 death in 2011, Cook took over as CEO, overseeing the company\u2019s transformation into one of the world\u2019s most valuable brands.\nHere are some other key remarks from the interview:\nCook goes to Steve Jobs\u2019 old office for inspiration\nMore than a decade after Jobs\u2019 death, his old office at Apple\u2019s former headquarters, One Infinite Loop, remains intact. Cook revealed that he still visits the office occasionally, finding inspiration in the space where Jobs worked.\n\u201cNo one\u2019s ever moved in there,\u201d Cook told Wired. \u201cI like my connection back to Steve, and I like the company\u2019s connection back to Steve. From him emanates our values and our DNA.\u201d\nThe office serves as a touchstone for Cook and a reminder of Jobs\u2019 enduring influence on Apple\u2019s culture. While Apple Park now serves as the company\u2019s headquarters, One Infinite Loop, in Cupertino, California, remains a symbol of the company\u2019s history.\nAI is about to 'reinvent' everything at Apple\nAs Apple navigates a new era of technological innovation, Cook sees artificial intelligence as the next transformative chapter for the company.\n\u201cAI will reinvent and provide a new era and a new chapter for iPhone, iPad, and the Mac,\u201d Cook said during the interview. \u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning.\u201d\nCook highlighted AI\u2019s potential to reshape how users interact with Apple\u2019s products, making them more intuitive and capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks. While Siri remains a cornerstone of Apple\u2019s AI efforts, Cook suggested that significant advancements are on the horizon.\n\u201cI think more people will have a relationship with Siri because it will become more personally relevant and be able to take tasks off your plate,\u201d he said.\nStory Continues\nFor Cook, AI holds the same groundbreaking potential as the iPhone\u2019s introduction of multi-touch technology, which revolutionized smartphones. With AI, he believes Apple is poised to usher in a new era of innovation, much like it has done in decades past.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

After the US announced fresh curbs on export of advanced AI chips to China, the Asian country responded by announcing that it had banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony that have widespread military applications. Some of the banned minerals like gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells. Others, like antimony, are used in bullets and other weaponry, while graphite is the largest component by volume of electric vehicle batteries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAccording to news agency Reuters, the move has sparked fresh concern that Beijing could next target other critical minerals, including those with even broader usage such as nickel or cobalt. China has also blocked some purchases from chipmaker Micron citing security concerns. There are also reports that chipmaker Intel would be the next target following comments from the Cybersecurity Association of China that the American firm has constantly harmed the country's national security and interests and that its products sold in China should be subject to a security review.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Yes, the biggest trend of 2024 will continue to dominate 2025. But there will be some new wrinkles over the next 12 months, as well.\nCompanies will begin releasing more powerful AI models, while AI agents will gain prominence. The industry will also focus on bringing AI features to more consumers and work to make AI data centers more energy efficient.\nAccording to Ashley Llorens, corporate vice president and managing director at Microsoft (MSFT) Research, AI models will soon be able to handle far more complex tasks.\n\u201cWhat we've got now is we've got AI that can reason better, that can perceive the environment in more sophisticated ways,\u201d Llorens told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd so what that's going to mean is that we'll be able to delegate a more sophisticated set of tasks to the AI to complete on our behalf.\u201d\nThat\u2019s where AI agents come in. Think of agents as autonomous or semi-autonomous apps that can perform specific tasks for you. They\u2019re more capable than the traditional chatbots like ChatGPT that you\u2019re likely used to, but can still be controlled via natural language inputs.\nYou can, for example, tell an AI agent how to triage incoming customer requests or pull information out of invoices and drop it into the appropriate spreadsheet to more easily track employee expenses without having to do it all yourself.\nLlorens says that Microsoft is using AI agents to connect employees across its organization.\n\u201cWe have this capability we call \u2018coffee connections.\u2019 And it's essentially the idea that I delegate a half hour on my calendar every week to an AI system that tells me who I should have a coffee chat with from anywhere in the organization,\u201d Llorens explained.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at Microsoft's Ignite 2024 conference Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\u201cWe have a background process where AI is essentially simulating lots of random conversations between people, analyzing the outcome to see which conversations are most interesting \u2026 and then using that to propose \u2026 here you go, talk to this person, and by the way, you may want to hit these topics.\u201d\nAI will also become increasingly multimodal over the next year, helping it to do things like interact with text, as well as visual and audio inputs. Microsoft says you\u2019ll begin to see this when it launches its Copilot Vision for Copilot in Windows. The feature, which will be opt-in, will be able to see what you\u2019re looking at on a web page and then allow you to ask questions about it.\nSo, if you\u2019re looking at a movie, you might be able to ask Copilot Vision who\u2019s in it using your voice or text without naming the movie, and the app will know you\u2019re talking about the movie poster or web page you\u2019re looking at and provide the appropriate response.\nStory Continues\nIn addition to enhanced functionality, Microsoft says AI will become more energy efficient via hardware upgrades. The company claims that in the coming years new data centers will \u201cconsume zero water for cooling\u201d and that it will focus on using low-carbon steel and concrete alternatives.\nOn Monday, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft\u2019s largest cloud rival, also announced a push to make its data centers more efficient so that customers can get more computing power from the energy the servers currently use.\nMicrosoft, which has invested heavily in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, is among the slew of companies banking on AI as its next major growth opportunity. Amazon has invested in AI firm Anthropic, while Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which also invested in Anthropic, continues building out its Gemini AI family of products. Facebook parent Meta (META) is also leaning heavily into AI to power its ad sales and customer retention functionalities.\nWall Street, meanwhile, is looking for proof that Silicon Valley\u2019s massive AI investments are paying off via increased revenues and rising share prices.\nMicrosoft got out to an early lead in the generative AI space thanks to its OpenAI investments. Despite that, shares of Microsoft are up just 14% year to date compared to Google\u2019s stock, which is up 22%, and Amazon\u2019s, which is up 39%.

          "whole_article": "President-elect Donald Trump is making it clear he doesn't intend to ease up on the nation's technology giants once he is back in the Oval Office.\nThe latest sign came Wednesday when he said he would nominate Gail Slater, an aide to Vice President-elect JD Vance, to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division.\n\"Big Tech has run wild for years,\" Trump said in a statement announcing the appointment on his Truth Social platform, \"stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!\"\n\"I was proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail\u2019s leadership,\" he added.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump attends a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket, in Brownsville, Texas, on Nov. 19 . Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nThe appointment and comments from the president-elect offer a new signal that his administration could press forward with a series of investigations and lawsuits challenging the way the biggest companies in the technology industry, including Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), maintain their dominance.\nIt was Trump\u2019s first administration that initially sued Google over antitrust concerns, which led to a ruling by a district court judge in August that the tech giant illegally monopolized the search engine market. The DOJ has asked a judge to consider breaking up the company in a separate phase of the trial that won't wrap up until 2025.\nIt was also during Trump\u2019s first administration that the Federal Trade Commission sought to unwind Meta\u2019s (META) acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in a case set for trial in April. Trump's first administration also launched an antitrust investigation into Apple (APPL), leading the Biden administration to sue the iPhone maker earlier this year.\nAnother ominous sign for Big Tech is that last month Trump nominated Brendan Carr as Federal Communications Commission chair.\nJust days before he got that chairmanship appointment, Carr sent letters to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook predicting \"broad ranging actions to restore Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights\" once Trump takes office.\nBrendan Carr, Trump's pick to be FCC boss. Photo: Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nThat might include \"a review of your companies\u2019 activities as well as third-party organizations and groups that have acted to curtail those rights,\" according to a copy of the letter Carr posted to X.\nThe appointment of Slater to run the DOJ's antitrust division elevates a figure who was a tech policy adviser at the National Economic Council during Trump\u2019s first term. She previously spent a decade at the Federal Trade Commission, including as an adviser to former Democratic FTC commissioner Julie Brill during President Barack Obama's administration.\nStory Continues\nThe FTC shares responsibility with the DOJ for enforcing the nation's antitrust laws.\nIn the private sector, Slater held positions at Fox Corp. and Roku. She also worked for the since-dismantled lobbying organization Internet Association, which advocated for the country's most powerful tech firms.\nThe companies included Amazon (AMZN), Airbnb (ABNB), Facebook (META), Google, eBay (EBAY), Microsoft (MSFT), Spotify (SPOT), Uber (UBER), X, and Zillow (Z).\nSlater's boss, Vance, has expressed admiration for the approach of FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has gained a reputation for aggressively pursuing lawsuits and investigations targeting the biggest tech giants.\nLina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that Khan had launched a wide-ranging antitrust investigation into Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.\nIt is still not known whether Trump will seek to replace Khan and with whom. Slater has acted as an adviser to the administration on that subject.\nThere is also no guarantee Khan\u2019s replacement will hold a similar point of view, or continue her pursuits.\n\u201cWe don't know who's going to succeed Lina Khan, but you can bet it's not going to be anyone with the philosophy of Lina Khan,\" said former FTC member and University of Baltimore Law School antitrust professor Robert Lande.\nTrump has sent some mixed messages about how far he wants to go to hold tech firms accountable.\nWhile campaigning, he was asked whether he supported a breakup of Google as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market. Trump suggested that Google\u2019s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet Inc. REUTERS/Carlos Barria \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview. The former president described Google\u2019s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nOn Wednesday, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said of Trump that \"in my conversations with him, he\u2019s definitely very focused on American competitiveness, particularly in technology, including AI.\"\nWhen asked at a New York Times DealBook summit in New York if Trump's election changes the dynamic for Google's antitrust case, he said, \"This is a DOJ case, and the case is already in court,\" noting that it started under Trump's first term.\n\"So I don\u2019t have any particular insights into that.\" The company, he added, will \"defend ourselves there.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $220 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 43.6% since the start of the year compared to the 32.3% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 40.1% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 31, 2024, Amazon reported EPS of $1.43 versus consensus estimate of $1.14 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.15%.\nFor the current fiscal year, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $5.19 per share on $637.22 billion in revenues. This represents a 78.97% change in EPS on a 10.86% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.21 per share on $706.34 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 19.7% and 10.85%, respectively.\nValuation Metrics\nAmazon may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\nAmazon has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 42X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 25.3X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 28.9X versus its peer group's average of 15.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.49. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nZacks Rank\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\nStory Continues\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amazon passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Amazon shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\nHow Does AMZN Stack Up to the Competition?\nShares of AMZN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG). BKNG has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of C.\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Booking Holdings Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 7.63%, and for the current fiscal year, BKNG is expected to post earnings of $209.95 per share on revenue of $23.42 billion.\nShares of Booking Holdings Inc. have gained 4.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 28.89X and a P/CF of 30.16X.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is in the top 28% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AMZN and BKNG, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Uncertainty over the impact of policy changes announced in the budget, in potentially nudging inflation higher and thereby keeping interest rates elevated for longer, as well as Donald Trump's election victory in the US, have weighed on investor sentiment.\nHowever, there is also specific company news that has driven certain stocks higher and lower.\nVistry Group\nShares in Vistry plummeted in October, on the back of a profit warning issued after the housebuilder discovered costs in one of its business divisions had been understated.\nVistry said in a trading update at the time that it had discovered that cost projections to complete nine of its 46 developments in its south division had been \"understated\" by around 10% of the total build costs. As a result, it estimated seeing a one-off impact for revising cost assumptions, expecting profits before tax to be \u00a380m than previously forecast, at \u00a3350m ($442m).\nRead more: Investors shift to US funds and tech in November amid lower interest rates\nIn another trading update in early November, Vistry then lowered its pre-tax profit guidance from \u00a3350m to \u00a3300m, as more details came to light around its cost issues in the division.\nThe stock is now down 27% year-to-date, giving it a market capitalisation of \u00a32.18bn, according to London Stock Exchange Group data.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said Vistry \"had been chasing faster-than-average growth since its transition to a partnership giant, specialising in providing affordable housing by teaming up with local authorities.\n\"But the scale of recent profit downgrades raised big questions about the new structure and internal controls, and seriously dented the share price.\"\nStory continues\n\u2022 USD\n(VTY.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nFrasers Group (FRAS.L)\nMike Ashley's retail company Frasers Group is another stock will leave the FTSE 100, according to LSEG. It has the second smallest market capitalisation in the index, at \u00a33.34bn.\nFrasers shares slid 13% on Thursday after the group warned profits before tax would be lower for its 2025 fiscal year.\nIn its latest results, the retail group posted a 8% fall in revenue to \u00a32.54bn ($3.23bn) in the first half of its 2025 fiscal year, compared with the same period last year. Adjusted profit before tax for the first half was 1.5% lower year-on-year at \u00a3299.2m.\nFrasers said recent trading conditions had been tougher in the wake of the autumn budget and amid weaker consumer confidence.\nGiven this uncertainty, Frasers said it now expected adjusted profit before tax to be in the range of \u00a3550m and \u00a3600m for the year, that's down from a previous estimate of \u00a3575m to \u00a3625m.

          "whole_article": "Jeff Bezos is tired of people constantly judging him solely by how obscenely rich he is.\nThe Amazon (AMZN) founder argues there\u2019s an \u201coverfocus\u201d in American society on where he ranks in relation to other fellow centibillionaires, whose personal fortunes are often worth more than major multinational corporations like Nike or Starbucks.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nInstead the world\u2019s second wealthiest entrepreneur, behind only Elon Musk, told the New York Times DealBook Summit on Wednesday he would prefer to be seen first and foremost as an inventor who has rewarded his investors for placing their trust in him.\n\u201cSomebody needs to make a list where they rank people by how much wealth they\u2019ve created for other people,\u201d suggested Bezos, \u201cinstead of the Forbes list that ranks you by your own wealth.\u201d\nBezos argued he would be right up there near the top of the list alongside Jensen Huang, cofounder of the world\u2019s second most valuable company, Nvidia.\nThanks to its early push into cloud computing with AWS, Amazon is today worth around $2.3 trillion. Of that sum, the stake still owned by Bezos is around $200 billion.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ve created something like $2.1 trillion in wealth for other people. That should put me pretty high on some kind of list\u2014and that\u2019s a better list,\u201d Bezos explained.\nThe ultrawealthy nowadays cannot afford to be recluses\nBezos, who once had an entire historic bridge in Europe dismantled to allow for his new triple-masted yacht to leave a shipyard, said public figures such as himself tend to be judged all too often by singular aspects of their lives.\nHe joked that he actually did Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates a favor by wresting away from him the poisoned chalice that is the title \u201crichest man in the world\u201d\u2014a mantle Bezos said he never aspired to in the first place.\nBezos recalled, when the two were asked years ago about this changing of the guard, he leapt in to reply for Gates.\n\u201cBefore Bill could answer,\u201d he said on Wednesday, \u201cI looked at Bill and said, \u2018You\u2019re welcome.\u2019\u201d\nDuring the past few years, there has been a backlash against the ultrawealthy ever since ProPublica in June 2021 first named and shamed billionaires\u2014including Bezos and Musk\u2014who profited from pandemic-era largesse while evading taxes.\nPeople of their stature can ill afford these days to remain an inscrutable recluse like Howard Hughes. Speaking to audiences such as those at the New York Times Summit, or appearing on podcasts like Lex Fridman\u2019s, is Bezos\u2019s attempt to at least partially tell his side of the story, so others do not do it for him.\nBezos would like to be at the top of a Forbes ranking of inventors\nIt frustrates the Amazon founder that people assume he must care where he ranks on Forbes\u2019s billionaire list, when in reality he would much rather they judge him on the products and services he creates.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIf I could somehow have a Forbes list of inventors, and if I could climb my way to the top of that inventor list, that\u2019s what would make me [happy], then I would be understood\u2014at least in part,\u201d he said.\nBut in the end, he argued, trying to correct public perceptions of himself is a time-consuming endeavor that inevitably detracts from his actual work at Amazon and his commercial space firm, Blue Origin.\nMoreover it would likely prove fruitless as the public tends to latch on to the more obvious aspects of his life, such as his wealth. And if Forbes wanted to continue encouraging this overfocus, as he put it, why couldn\u2019t they at least rank him by how much he has enriched others in the process?\n\u201cThat would be a pretty cool list,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cSomebody should do that list.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

According to Adobe Analytics, online spending has hit $10.8 billion in the US, and Generative AI chatbots drove a 1,800% surge in retail site traffic compared to 2023. These tools helped bargain hunters find deals, compare products, and check out more quickly.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nSimilarly, Salesforce revealed that the use of AI-enabled online chat services grew 31% year-on-year on Black Friday, with U.S. Black Friday online sales reaching $17.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Digital retailers using generative AI and agents in their customer service experiences saw a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those who did not.\nIn other news, OpenAI\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, told the Financial Times that the company is considering introducing ads on its platform. She further revealed that the company had recently hired Kevin Weil, an executive from Instagram, who was well-suited to the task.\n\u201cThe good news with Kevin Weil at the wheel with product is that he came from Instagram. He knows how this [introducing ads] works\u201d.\nHowever, a later statement issued by Friar reveals that while OpenAI may be open to the possibility, they currently don\u2019t have any active plans for the same.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re open to exploring other revenue streams in the future, we have no active plans to pursue advertising.\u201d\nA Bloomberg Opinion\u00a0column by Dave Lee\u00a0reveals that such an apparent change in statements could be because the AI Company realized that advertisements tend to signal \u201ctroubling trends\u201d. The shift may send doubts about the profitability of its subscription-based model, raising concerns about potential \u201censhittification\u201d, as tech commentator and activist Cory Doctorow famously terms it, where user-focused features are compromised for advertiser-driven engagement and time optimization.\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s endeavors are so huge that its revenues don\u2019t manage to cover them. The development of advanced AI models would require even greater spending, which is why advertising could be seen as an avenue to help bridge the gap. However, its risks undermine ChatGPT's appeal as an alternative to Google search, potentially disrupting its user experience, Lee\u00a0noted.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX).\nNetflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.91, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.91 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.1% and 4.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NFLX\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Netflix, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NFLX Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $19.78.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Netflix.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.69%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.31%.\nThe the stock of internet video service has risen by 18.1% in the past month, leading the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 10.43% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.79%.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Netflix in its upcoming earnings disclosure. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $4.20, marking a 99.05% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $10.15 billion, showing a 14.95% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $19.78 per share and revenue of $38.91 billion. These totals would mark changes of +64.42% and +15.37%, respectively, from last year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Netflix currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn the context of valuation, Netflix is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 45.62. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 9.52, which means Netflix is trading at a premium to the group.\nAlso, we should mention that NFLX has a PEG ratio of 1.74. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Broadcast Radio and Television industry was having an average PEG ratio of 0.79.\nStory Continues\nThe Broadcast Radio and Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 85, finds itself in the top 34% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: DPZ) is joining forces with Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) to prove that an Emergency Pizza can save the day \u2013 even in the high-stakes realm of Squid Game. As the hit Netflix series approaches its season two debut on Dec. 26, Domino's is activating at Squid Game: The Experience to give away free Emergency Pizza for a year to players with the lowest scores \u2013 just in time for when they need it most. On Dec. 12, the player with the lowest score from each competing group in Squid Game: The Experience at Manhattan Mall in New York City will win free Domino's Emergency Pizza for a year.\nAs the hit Netflix series Squid Game approaches its season two debut on Dec. 26, Domino\u2019s is activating at Squid Game: The Experience to give away free Emergency Pizza for a year to players with the lowest scores \u2013 just in time for when they need it most.\n\"Those who watch Netflix's Squid Game know that losing is the ultimate emergency, but Domino's is here to turn that around,\" said Kate Trumbull, Domino's executive vice president \u2013 chief marketing officer. \"We're making lemonade out of lemons for players by solving their heart-pounding predicament with free pizza for a year, so they can have Domino's whenever their next emergency happens.\"\nSquid Game: The Experience is a fully immersive experience based on Netflix's Squid Game series. Players can compete in five challenges inspired by the show. A member of the Pink Guard will present the losing player out of each group with free Emergency Pizza for a year, awarded in the form of $500 in gift cards within a custom Domino's and Squid Game Dalgona tin.\nThis is the second time Domino's has partnered with Netflix. In 2022, Domino's teamed up with the most popular streaming service in the world to launch a first-of-its-kind mind ordering app, prior to the season four premiere of Stranger Things.\n\"We're thrilled to work with Netflix on yet another fun and unexpected brand integration,\" said Trumbull. \"Our Squid Game activation brings Emergency Pizza to more people, in more places than ever in ways you never would've guessed!\"\nSquid Game\nand Domino's Emergency Pizza Campaign\n\nWant even more of Domino's and Squid Game?

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine Netflix\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\nSee our latest analysis for Netflix\nWhat Is Netflix Worth?\nAccording to our valuation model, Netflix seems to be fairly priced at around 16.08% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Netflix today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $773.37, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Netflix\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from Netflix?\nNasdaqGS:NFLX Earnings and Revenue Growth December 3rd 2024\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Netflix. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NFLX\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NFLX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks.\nAs 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. They beckon 2025 with a rather historic run on the stock market that has seen several high-growth technology stocks flourish despite the fact that until September, interest rates in the US were at a two-decade high level.\nDriving the bullishness behind technology stocks is artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that relies on high-end GPUs to run advanced mathematical techniques and infer new conclusions from existing data sets has been the focus of Wall Street and big technology companies. So far, most of the AI-related stock gains have been limited to the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite graphics processing unit (GPU) company whose stock is up by more than\u00a0700%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.\nHowever, the gains have to broaden out to other stocks for the AI wave to continue. This broadening is dependent on the use of AI increasing among businesses and consumers. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo has some insights to share. In its report titled \u2018Generative AI \u2014 Potential pitfalls, challenges, and risks the bank outlines that while AI \u201chas the potential to be broadly transformative,\u201d there are several \u201coutstanding questions and concerns that need to be addressed before it is widely accepted on a larger scale.\u201d Quoting its \u2018The AI Index 2024 Annual Report,\u2019 the bank points out that from 2012 to 2023, the number of AI incidents has jumped more than tenfold from sitting at roughly 10 to ~122. These incidents cover the ethical misuse of AI such as the wrong detection of criminals stemming from facial recognition systems.\nWF\u00a0points\u00a0out that while these incidents are concerning, other factors will also determine AI\u2019s wider acceptability and use. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints. The bank adds that these factors are also accompanied by the potentially transformative effect of AI on the labor market. Starting from its beliefs about the labor market, WF believes that generative AI, which is different from other AI systems such as machine learning, will have a more \u201cnuanced\u201d impact on the labor market compared to traditional AI. Commenting on common worries of AI taking jobs away, the bank outlines that the jobs that AI will replace will in turn be replaced by new jobs created by AI. To quote WF, it believes \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s disruptive effect on the labor market to mirror other forms of automation \u2014 as in the past, its impact likely will be mitigated over time by new occupations spawned by the innovations themselves.\u201d\nStory Continues\nTo help bolster its claim, WF shares data from MIT. It points out that MIT\u2019s estimates show that \u201c60% of U.S. workers are now employed in occupations that did not exist 84 years ago.\u201d As for which job functions might give way to AI, these include knowledge-based roles such as those found in financial services and support roles such as those performed by customer support agents.\nTwo additional key disruptive AI effects that Wall Street in particular is keenly aware of are its rising costs and the effect on the utility industry. The S&P\u2019s utility sector is up by 28.36% year-to-date which leads the broader index\u2019s 26.48% in gains by nearly two percentage points. Commenting on this, the bank believes that \u201cthere will be a significant increase in hardware demand, notably within the data-center environment, to accommodate the substantial increase in AI workloads,\u201d adding that \u201cit may take a number of years to increase the operational efficiency of various large language models and decrease costs to a level more in-line with existing search engines.\u201d WF also shares that while existing opportunities to expand data center footprint to accommodate AI are present, as they \u201cdiminish, companies may revisit existing data-center locations to retrofit and upgrade hardware and infrastructure in support of the power and data-consumption needs of new AI technologies.\u201d\nGiven the criticality of the data center space to AI, WF expands on this sector in another\u00a0report. Titled \u2018Generative AI transforming data center landscape\u201d it comments on the capital expenditure required to set up data centers, future trends for data centers, and the stock market sectors that might benefit from growing interest and focus on the data center industry. According to its analysis, investor attention is mostly focused on AI-related investments in semiconductors and cloud computing.\nHowever, other sectors, such as \u201ccabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators\u201d are also important. WF quotes a utility company to explain why these tertiary sectors are critical in the AI wave. It shares that utility company believes that \u201cthe server rack power density required to train a generative-AI-based large language model can require up to five to seven times more power than server racks used for traditional IT workloads in a data center.\u201d\nWhile semiconductor companies are natural beneficiaries of the AI boom, some oft-ignored sectors that WF mentions are industrials and materials. It outlines that when it comes to building massive data centers, estimates suggest \u201cthat approximately 35% \u2013 45% of the cost is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out. These areas are addressable by companies who supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors).\u201d Additionally, \u201c40% \u2013 45% and 15% \u2013 20% of the remaining cost can be attributed to electrical and HVAC systems respectively,\u201d according to Wells Fargo. AI is having an effect on materials, as per the bank, in the form of \u201cincreased demand for materials that are used in the production of semiconductor chips, water handling and recycling within data centers, and steel and construction materials to build data centers.\u201d\nFor some materials stocks and a primer on how they are reliant on the broader economic activity, you can check out\u00a010 Best Materials Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s top AI & non-AI stocks that can outpace the flagship S&P, we selected technology-focused stocks from the bank\u2019s recent Focus List and ranked them by their consensus next twelve-month EPS estimates.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:NFLX)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 121\nNTM EPS Estimate: $22.77\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the world\u2019s biggest video streaming company. It enjoys a wide moat in the industry and is the market leader. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s market position has enabled it to amass a whopping 282.7 million subscribers under its belt. This subscriber base is the key to the firm\u2019s hypothesis, as its fate now depends on the ability to monetize the user base, retain its customers, and add new users into its fold. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also benefits from the fact that it produces television shows and movies, which sets it apart by offering exclusive content to its subscribers. The ability to take on traditional television channels and bolster its user base is central to creating tailwinds as is evident by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s 6.5% share price gain since the historic fight between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul which saw 60 million household worldwide tune into its platform.\nEnsemble Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cThe rapid recovery of Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth has shocked investors who drove the stock down to a price of just $166 in May 2022. While at the time, bearish investors were declaring the company\u2019s growth days were behind it, instead the company added a remarkable 13.1 million new subscribers in the most recent quarter. This was the single largest quarterly subscriber addition other than the large gains experienced during the first quarter of COVID. For all of 2023, the company added nearly 30 million new subscribers, making it the largest annual gain in Netflix history other than the first year of COVID.\u201d\nOverall, NFLX ranks 2nd on our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks. NFLX\u00a0 is a top cyclical stock Wells Fargo is confident about. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

Or maybe you\u2019ve bought an apartment from the man himself or one of his rapidly growing army of brokers, all operating under his eponymous real estate empire, which closed the sixth most residential sales in Manhattan last year, according to the Real Deal.\u00a0(Serhant tells me he\u2019s opening in a new market roughly every 14 days.)\nBut now, Serhant wants to position himself as a tech entrepreneur, raising $45 million from the respected New York venture firms Camber Creek and Left Lane Capital and launching an app called S.MPLE, designed to help brokers navigate their sales.\nMost software founders gain celebrity because of the success of their products, but from his flagship headquarters in SoHo, which greets guests with a massive statue of an S right inside the front door, Serhant makes a convincing case for why the reverse can also be true.\nThrough his reality shows and millions of social media followers, Serhant helped pioneer a new form of real estate sales, where brokers find buyers through virality rather than staid listings in newspapers and Craigslist. His average agent is 20 years younger than the industry average. \u201cThey only know their business through social media,\u201d he tells me. The number one lead generator? LinkedIn.\nSerhant describes S.MPLE as \u201cInstacart for salespeople\u201d (See, he really is one of you.) It wasn\u2019t his first foray into developing real estate-focused tech, including an aborted metaverse platform called UNIVERS and a real-time video editing app called Spaces, which never took off with his agents. \u201cI used to call them missteps,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to go through that process.\u201d\nS.MPLE came as a learning from his second attempt\u2014that people want to spend less time on their screens, rather than more. The app allows brokers to automate parts of their sales process, from listings to communication. Rather than your typical SaaS product though, the real innovation\u2014like Serhant\u2019s brokerage business\u2014is his distribution funnel. Every aspect of his operation, from social media to reality TV to actual real estate sales\u2014works as a flywheel to generate more business. \u201cOur customer acquisition cost is near zero,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIf a significant amount of your dollars are going to Meta ad spend or figuring out how to take a product and create distribution, it's just a rough race.\u201d\nStory Continues\nSerhant says that he\u2019s been profitable from the beginning and that he\u2019s bringing venture investors on board because of the help they can provide from a strategic partnership perspective, with Left Lane Capital known for its consumer-focused portfolio and Camber Creek focused on property technology. Both firms recognized Serhant\u2019s \u201cinherent value,\u201d as Left Lane Capital\u2019s Harley Miller describes it. \u201cIt's made investors like us wake up to the power of this distribution and how big of a value driver and unique competitive moat it can be,\u201d Miller tells me.\nJeffrey Berman, general partner at Camber Creek, says that the most successful firms in his portfolio have \u201ccracked the code\u201d of the business-to-business-to-consumer model. He points to the rent payment platform Flex, which deals with multi-family-owner operators who can market to tenants en masse. \u201cIt's not apples to apples with the idea of having a socially recognizable personality, but it's similar in terms of the ability to [market] at a relatively low cost,\u201d he says.\nFor now, Serhant is rolling S.MPLE out to brokers across his own company and plans to expand to other outfits. His software ambitions may not supersede his Netflix renown anytime soon, but that might only aid his efforts. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a quote-unquote celebrity broker,\u201d Berman tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s actually a technology CEO, and he\u2019s running a pretty big company at that.\u201d\nLeo Schwartz\nTwitter: @leomschwartz\nEmail: leo.schwartz@fortune.com\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\nNina Ajemian curated the deals section of today\u2019s newsletter.

(NASDAQ:MGNI) stands against the other best Adtech stocks to buy.\nAs per Dimension Market Research, the Global\u00a0AdTech market\u00a0size touched\u00a0US$1,066.8 billion in 2023\u00a0and should reach US$3,528.4 billion by 2032. The market is expected to compound at ~14.2% from 2024 to 2032.\u00a0Some of the critical trends include a strong emphasis on privacy-centric advertising, growth fueled by AI-driven personalization, and dominance of video and mobile advertising.\nKey Trends Defining the AdTech Market\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning continue to drive sophisticated audience segmentation and personalized ad experiences. As per Geomotiv, a software development company, these technologies can quickly analyze vast amounts of data, predict user behavior, and tailor ads in real time. Collectively, these features help to improve engagement and conversion rates. The benefits of personalization and the opportunities provided should drive the demand for these solutions and the growth of AI-oriented AdTech companies.\nMarket experts believe that advertisers continue to target Programmatic advertising. This space continues to expand beyond traditional digital channels. Adnimation, a software company, highlighted that CTV ad spending is expected to grow to\u00a0$42.4 billion by 2027\u00a0in the US. Publishers that have video content should prioritize CTV and\u00a0find for best supply-side platform (SSP)\u00a0to tap into a rapidly growing market.\nAdvertisers have been leveraging programmatic to reach the audiences with targeted ads. Furthermore, programmatic continues to make inroads into the audio format, such as podcasts and music streaming services. Next, AdTech SaaS companies have been providing customizable solutions, which enable advertisers to tailor the tools and features as per the specific needs. The popularity of these products continues to grow among advertisers and publishers.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\nBlockchain and\u00a0Influencer Marketing Should Drive Growth\nAs per Adnimation, data-driven influencer marketing is expected to dominate the broader AdTech market. Furthermore, the publishers and their AdTech counterparts continue collaborating with micro-influencers to fuel engagement and conversions. \u00a0Blockchain technology should also be key in ensuring transparency in digital ad transactions. By decentralizing ad transactions, blockchain can help reduce ad fraud, improve trust between publishers and advertisers, and enable accurate tracking of ad performance. This will result in more reliable revenue streams. Adnimation also believes that, by 2025, video is expected to dominate digital ad formats, making up\u00a082% of all internet traffic.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo list the 11 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we scanned through online rankings and AdTech-focused ETFs. After getting the initial list of 20-25 stocks, we shortlisted the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the shortlisted stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA marketing manager examining a publisher's digital inventory on a laptop.\nMagnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 20\nMagnite, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGNI) offers online advertising solutions. The company is a leading independent sell-side advertising platform that specializes in programmatic advertising throughout multiple channels. Wall Street believes that Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s expertise lies in connected TV (CTV), which remains the fastest-growing segment of digital advertising. The optimism around the company further strengthened when it got selected as the partner to power the Netflix ad-supported tier sale. The collaboration is expected to have a substantial impact on Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s future revenues.\nBofA Securities\u00a0analyst Omar Dessouky\u00a0believes that the Netflix partnership should result in a $30-million revenue run rate by 2025 end.\u00a0 Furthermore, the analyst believes that the Netflix partnership should be able to contribute $44 million/$69 million/$199 million\u00a0to Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s revenue in 2026, 2027, and 2028. Industry experts believe that Netflix should become the company\u2019s largest CTV customer, which should help it offset any weakness from other partnerships.\nAs Netflix's ad-supported tier grows, Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) is expected to see improved revenue without proportional increases in costs. This should result in higher profitability. Furthermore, the company\u2019s growth momentum is expected to be aided by its CTV advertising segment, which should see strong ad spend growth and programmatic adoption.\nMagnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI)\u2019s partnership with Disney got a\u00a02-year extension, which further strengthens a 6-year collaboration.\u00a0As a result of this, Magnite will help in monetizing Disney\u2019s vast ad-supported content, spanning more than 30 DSPs. Courtesy of this high-profile content, the expanded relationship gives Magnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) a strong standing in premium advertising.\nChoice Equities Capital Management, a hedge fund manager, recently released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMagnite, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MGNI) and CROX \u2013 Magnite, Inc. and Croc\u2019s Inc. remain holdings in the portfolio and were recently discussed in detail on the Yet Another Value Blog podcast, which can be found here: YAVB podcast. As discussed herein, both remain well-positioned in their respective industries and represent attractive values on anticipated cash flows in years to come. Magnite, as highlighted, looks attractive on its own merits, though shares could become particularly interesting should a handful of industry anti-trust events break their way.\u201d\nOverall, MGNI ranks 8th on our list of best AdTech stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MGNI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MGNI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Like Nvidia NVDA, Arista has seen its stock more than double since 2023, leading to a stock split.\nImplementing a 4-1 stock split on Tuesday, let\u2019s see if now is still a good time to buy Arista\u2019s stock with the company aiming to make shares more accessible to a broader base of investors.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nArista\u2019s Dominance & Consistency\nArista\u2019s strong financial performance and market leadership have been the primary catalyst for its stellar stock performance. This has been enhanced by Arista\u2019s focus on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, becoming a leader in high-speed networking which is critical for AI-driven data centers.\nNotably, Arista has collaborated with Nvidia to create AI Data Centers that align compute and network domains to a single managed AI entity. Arista also has strategic partnerships with Meta Platforms META\u00a0and Microsoft MSFT\u00a0in regards to building out AI infrastructure.\nRemarkably, Arista has still surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus in every quarter since it went public in 2014 and has exceeded sales estimates for 20 consecutive quarters. Bolstering Arista\u2019s consistency, the company has posted an average EPS surprise of 14.77% in its last four quarterly reports.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nArista\u2019s Valuation & Balance Sheet\nSeeing as stock splits don\u2019t affect a company\u2019s financial metrics or valuation, ANET is still trading at around 48X forward earnings but at $106 a share as opposed to a previous price tag of over $400.\nDespite rallying more than +80% year to date, ANET doesn't trade at an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500 and its Zacks Communication-Components Industry average of 25X respectively.\nNotably, Arista trades on par with Nvidia\u2019s 49.5X forward earnings multiple. While Arista and Nvidia are commanding quite a premium in terms of price to sales their top line expansion is justifiable of such. In this regard, Arista is expecting total sales to increase over 17% in fiscal 2024 and FY25 with projections edging toward $8 billion.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFurthermore, Arista\u2019s cash & equivalents have soared since the pandemic to $7.42 billion at the end of Q3 2024 from $2.72 billion in 2019. Magnifying Arista\u2019s strong balance sheet is that it has $12.84 billion in total assets compared to $3.6 billion in total liabilities.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStory Continues\nPositive EPS Revisions\nArista\u2019s annual earnings are now expected at $2.18 per share in FY24 ($8.72/4) compared to EPS of $6.94 last year. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to increase 10% to $2.39.\nEven Better, FY24 and FY25 EPS estimates are nicely up in the last 30 days after Arista was able to comfortably surpass its Q3 top and bottom line expectations in early November.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nFollowing its 4-1 stock split, Arista Networks sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions. To the delight of investors, Arista\u2019s stock is more affordable and should still have more upside.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After the US announced fresh curbs on export of advanced AI chips to China, the Asian country responded by announcing that it had banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony that have widespread military applications. Some of the banned minerals like gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells. Others, like antimony, are used in bullets and other weaponry, while graphite is the largest component by volume of electric vehicle batteries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAccording to news agency Reuters, the move has sparked fresh concern that Beijing could next target other critical minerals, including those with even broader usage such as nickel or cobalt. China has also blocked some purchases from chipmaker Micron citing security concerns. There are also reports that chipmaker Intel would be the next target following comments from the Cybersecurity Association of China that the American firm has constantly harmed the country's national security and interests and that its products sold in China should be subject to a security review.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nThe investigation is a component of a continuous review on Nvidia's planned $700 million purchase of Run:ai, a business focused on running AI chips most efficiently. This investigation might have more general effects on Nvidia's market posture in artificial intelligence technology.\nThe survey seeks to evaluate Nvidia's corporate policies, especially with relation to possible anti-competitive effects. Announced in April, the Run:ai purchase seeks to enable more effective artificial intelligence workloads thereby enhancing Nvidia's capacity in artificial intelligence. operate:ai's solution lets many workloads operate in parallel, therefore maybe lowering the need for GPUs and providing Nvidia an advantage in terms of cost-efficiencies for AI developers.\nCrucially for training big language models, a fundamental component of generative artificial intelligence systems, Nvidia has been increasing manufacturing of its H100 AI GPUs in recent months. These initiatives coincide with a worldwide demand for artificial intelligence capabilities, of which Nvidia is a significant provider for big tech firms engaged in AI research like Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) and Microsoft (MSFT, Financials).\nDriven mostly by expansion in its data center business, Nvidia also recently showed outstanding financial results, with quarterly sales above $16 billion.

The feature, which will be opt-in, will be able to see what you\u2019re looking at on a web page and then allow you to ask questions about it.\nSo, if you\u2019re looking at a movie, you might be able to ask Copilot Vision who\u2019s in it using your voice or text without naming the movie, and the app will know you\u2019re talking about the movie poster or web page you\u2019re looking at and provide the appropriate response.\nStory Continues\nIn addition to enhanced functionality, Microsoft says AI will become more energy efficient via hardware upgrades. The company claims that in the coming years new data centers will \u201cconsume zero water for cooling\u201d and that it will focus on using low-carbon steel and concrete alternatives.\nOn Monday, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft\u2019s largest cloud rival, also announced a push to make its data centers more efficient so that customers can get more computing power from the energy the servers currently use.\nMicrosoft, which has invested heavily in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, is among the slew of companies banking on AI as its next major growth opportunity. Amazon has invested in AI firm Anthropic, while Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which also invested in Anthropic, continues building out its Gemini AI family of products. Facebook parent Meta (META) is also leaning heavily into AI to power its ad sales and customer retention functionalities.\nWall Street, meanwhile, is looking for proof that Silicon Valley\u2019s massive AI investments are paying off via increased revenues and rising share prices.\nMicrosoft got out to an early lead in the generative AI space thanks to its OpenAI investments. Despite that, shares of Microsoft are up just 14% year to date compared to Google\u2019s stock, which is up 22%, and Amazon\u2019s, which is up 39%. The broader S&P 500 is up 26%.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

          "whole_article": "President-elect Donald Trump is making it clear he doesn't intend to ease up on the nation's technology giants once he is back in the Oval Office.\nThe latest sign came Wednesday when he said he would nominate Gail Slater, an aide to Vice President-elect JD Vance, to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division.\n\"Big Tech has run wild for years,\" Trump said in a statement announcing the appointment on his Truth Social platform, \"stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!\"\n\"I was proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail\u2019s leadership,\" he added.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump attends a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket, in Brownsville, Texas, on Nov. 19 . Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nThe appointment and comments from the president-elect offer a new signal that his administration could press forward with a series of investigations and lawsuits challenging the way the biggest companies in the technology industry, including Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), maintain their dominance.\nIt was Trump\u2019s first administration that initially sued Google over antitrust concerns, which led to a ruling by a district court judge in August that the tech giant illegally monopolized the search engine market. The DOJ has asked a judge to consider breaking up the company in a separate phase of the trial that won't wrap up until 2025.\nIt was also during Trump\u2019s first administration that the Federal Trade Commission sought to unwind Meta\u2019s (META) acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in a case set for trial in April. Trump's first administration also launched an antitrust investigation into Apple (APPL), leading the Biden administration to sue the iPhone maker earlier this year.\nAnother ominous sign for Big Tech is that last month Trump nominated Brendan Carr as Federal Communications Commission chair.\nJust days before he got that chairmanship appointment, Carr sent letters to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook predicting \"broad ranging actions to restore Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights\" once Trump takes office.\nBrendan Carr, Trump's pick to be FCC boss. Photo: Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nThat might include \"a review of your companies\u2019 activities as well as third-party organizations and groups that have acted to curtail those rights,\" according to a copy of the letter Carr posted to X.\nThe appointment of Slater to run the DOJ's antitrust division elevates a figure who was a tech policy adviser at the National Economic Council during Trump\u2019s first term. She previously spent a decade at the Federal Trade Commission, including as an adviser to former Democratic FTC commissioner Julie Brill during President Barack Obama's administration.\nStory Continues\nThe FTC shares responsibility with the DOJ for enforcing the nation's antitrust laws.\nIn the private sector, Slater held positions at Fox Corp. and Roku. She also worked for the since-dismantled lobbying organization Internet Association, which advocated for the country's most powerful tech firms.\nThe companies included Amazon (AMZN), Airbnb (ABNB), Facebook (META), Google, eBay (EBAY), Microsoft (MSFT), Spotify (SPOT), Uber (UBER), X, and Zillow (Z).\nSlater's boss, Vance, has expressed admiration for the approach of FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has gained a reputation for aggressively pursuing lawsuits and investigations targeting the biggest tech giants.\nLina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that Khan had launched a wide-ranging antitrust investigation into Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.\nIt is still not known whether Trump will seek to replace Khan and with whom. Slater has acted as an adviser to the administration on that subject.\nThere is also no guarantee Khan\u2019s replacement will hold a similar point of view, or continue her pursuits.\n\u201cWe don't know who's going to succeed Lina Khan, but you can bet it's not going to be anyone with the philosophy of Lina Khan,\" said former FTC member and University of Baltimore Law School antitrust professor Robert Lande.\nTrump has sent some mixed messages about how far he wants to go to hold tech firms accountable.\nWhile campaigning, he was asked whether he supported a breakup of Google as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market. Trump suggested that Google\u2019s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet Inc. REUTERS/Carlos Barria \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview. The former president described Google\u2019s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nOn Wednesday, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said of Trump that \"in my conversations with him, he\u2019s definitely very focused on American competitiveness, particularly in technology, including AI.\"\nWhen asked at a New York Times DealBook summit in New York if Trump's election changes the dynamic for Google's antitrust case, he said, \"This is a DOJ case, and the case is already in court,\" noting that it started under Trump's first term.\n\"So I don\u2019t have any particular insights into that.\" The company, he added, will \"defend ourselves there.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "Waymo is gearing up to bring its robotaxi service to Miami which will accelerate an expansion that's been happening while its hobbled rivals remain in its rearview mirror.\nAs part of the road map unfurled Thursday, Waymo plans to begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, giving the robotaxis time to learn their way around Florida's biggest city before they start charging for rides in 2026. The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) expanse in Los Angeles, extending its reach beyond its two major markets in Phoenix and San Francisco.\nWaymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year as part of a partnership with the ride-hailing leader Uber.\nThe growth spurred Waymo to team up with fleet management service Moove to oversee maintenance of its robotaxis in Phoenix, where it now operates about 200 vehicles. Moove also will help manage the company's robotaxis in Miami.\nThe steady expansion into new markets is starting to fulfill what once seemed like a fantastical dream when Google began a secret self-driving car project dubbed \"Chauffeur\u201d in 2009 that ultimately spun off as Waymo in 2016.\nAlthough Waymo is still piling up substantial losses under its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., the service now provides more than 150,000 weekly trips without any history of catastrophic traffic accidents. That track record has increased confidence that Waymo will be able to continue to steer its robotaxis into more markets and eventually produce a steady stream of profits \u2014 an expectation that helped it recently raise $5.6 billion from Alphabet and a list of other major investors.\nMeanwhile, robotaxi rival Cruise is still trying to recover from a grisly accident last year that culminated in one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragging a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human. California regulators suspended Cruise's license in the aftermath and its once-ambitious expansion plans have been scaled back by its corporate parent, automaker General Motors.\nHaving periodically promised a fleet of Tesla robotaxis for nearly a decade, Tesla CEO Elon Musk renewed the pledge again in October when he predicted the electric carmaker's \"Cybercabs\" will be on U.S. roads in 2026.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Tech investors are girding for the latest development in TikTok\u2019s legal saga. Social media and search companies like Meta Platforms Inc. have a lot at stake, as does Oracle Corp., which counts TikTok as a big customer.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nKansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit\nNYC\u2019s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp\nAs Wars Rage, Cities Face a Dark New Era of Urban Destruction\nRiyadh Metro Partially Opens in Bid to Ease City\u2019s Traffic Jams\nThe US Court of Appeals in Washington is due to issue a ruling on whether to uphold or overturn a law that requires TikTok\u2019s China-based owner to sell the app by Jan. 19, or face a ban in the US. The ruling probably won\u2019t be the end of the drama, as any outcome would likely be appealed. But traders are watching every step carefully, with TikTok\u2019s more than 170 million US users and billions of dollars in advertising revenue top of mind.\nFor investors in companies like Instagram parent Meta, Google parent and YouTube owner Alphabet Inc., and smaller rivals like Pinterest Inc. and Snap Inc., a result that weakens TikTok would be a big positive. The company, owned by ByteDance Ltd., is used by about a third of US adults \u2014 and a majority of Americans under 30 \u2014 and is growing more rapidly than competitors, according to Pew Research Center surveys.\nUpholding the law would be a \u201cclear victory for Meta shares,\u201d according to Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. Consensus estimates have baked in TikTok competition through 2026, offering \u201call upside\u201d for Meta stock, Stucky said. Meta\u2019s Instagram features a TikTok rival product known as Reels.\nMeta, which is up more than 70% this year, hit an intraday record in Thursday morning trading.\nPinterest may also capture more user attention if TikTok were out of the picture, according to Stucky. It\u2019s been making a push into shoppable content, competing with similar efforts from TikTok and Instagram. TikTok said this week that it tripled its US shopping sales to more than $100 million on Black Friday.\nPinterest shares have had a volatile year, slumping in the summer after poor results before garnering some positive analyst attention a few months later. A weak sales forecast for the holiday quarter took that shine off, leaving the stock down 12% this year. Snap is also having a rough year, with a decline of more than 4% in early Thursday trading pushing the shares down 28% year-to-date.\nThere\u2019s also upside for Alphabet, though to a lesser extent, said Stucky. The main benefit would be via search, where Google faces a lot of competition \u2014 primarily from ChatGPT.\nStory Continues\nOn the flip side, if TikTok is ultimately banned in the US, it would be negative for Oracle, which provides the social media app with cloud infrastructure to store and process US user data. Oracle said in June that a ban would threaten its financial results, and Evercore ISI estimated that TikTok may account for as much as $800 million of annual sales. Shares in the software firm have been on a tear this year, rising almost 80%.\nFor traders and analysts, gaming out the various possibilities is a difficult task. The losing side in the upcoming ruling could appeal to the Supreme Court, delaying any final resolution. The re-election of Donald Trump \u2014 who has had a change of heart about TikTok and is now against a ban \u2014 also complicates matters.\nTD Cowen analyst Paul Gallant laid out three possibilities: The court upholds the entire TikTok ban statute; the court rejects the TikTok-specific ban but upholds the authority for the president to ban apps on national security grounds; the court rejects the entire statute as unconstitutional.\nThe most likely outcome is that the court upholds the ban, Gallant wrote, but he expects TikTok to survive anyway \u2014 with Trump potentially ordering a \u201cProject Texas-like monitoring arrangement and declaring TikTok to be officially divested and free to continue operating in the US.\u201d Project Texas was a plan introduced by TikTok several years ago to cordon off Americans\u2019 data from China with help from Oracle.\nBloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst Matthew Schettenhelm sees a 70% chance that TikTok loses the DC Circuit ruling, with the company then likely to make a last-ditch plea to the Supreme Court to pause the law\u2019s Jan. 19 deadline.\nThe justices could opt to take a case raising a consequential free speech question, likely putting it on a track for a decision in June, according to Schettenhelm. Still, he notes that TikTok would also need to convince five justices to freeze the Jan. 19 date, and sees this as \u201cpossible yet unlikely.\u201d\nOther legal maneuvering could also delay things well past that deadline, and Trump\u2019s involvement might affect the outcome in various ways, as laid out here by Bloomberg\u2019s Alexandra S. Levine. Another possibility is that the DC court comes up with a \u201ctechnical solution\u201d by ruling that the law violates the Constitution\u2019s prohibition against a so-called \u201cbill of attainder,\u201d according to Georgetown law professor Anupam Chander.\nAnd of course, there\u2019s always the possibility that TikTok could be acquired, which would change the landscape entirely as well \u2014 though ByteDance has said it won\u2019t sell its US TikTok business and there are probably few buyers that could handle such a large and potentially contentious acquisition.\nFor social media stocks, Oracle and the wider tech sector, whatever the court decides, it likely \u201cisn\u2019t going to be the end of the story,\u201d Stucky said.\nTop Tech Stories\nA potential split of Google\u2019s business is still under consideration, according to Teresa Ribera, the European Union\u2019s new competition chief, who also pledged to build bridges with incoming US President Donald Trump.\nIntel Corp., fresh off the abrupt departure of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, stuck with its current financial forecast during a presentation Wednesday while also saying it would keep a tight rein on capital spending.\nVietnam has ordered PDD Holdings Inc.\u2019s Temu to suspend sales in the country while it reviews the shopping app\u2019s registration, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported, becoming the latest government to apply pressure on the Chinese-owned e-commerce phenomenon.\nOpenAI is partnering with Anduril Industries Inc. to incorporate its artificial intelligence technology into the weapons maker\u2019s anti-drone systems, marking the AI developer\u2019s most significant push yet into the defense sector.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nPremarket\nMethode Electronics\nJohn Wiley\nPostmarket\nSamsara\nHP Enterprise\nGuidewire\nDocuSign\nGitlab\nUiPath\nSmartsheet\nHashiCorp\nAsana\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Stephen Kirkland.\n(Updates trading throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDubai\u2019s Alleged Crypto Scams Are Raking in Billions\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\nThe Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden\u2019s Last Overseas Trip\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

After the US announced fresh curbs on export of advanced AI chips to China, the Asian country responded by announcing that it had banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony that have widespread military applications. Some of the banned minerals like gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells. Others, like antimony, are used in bullets and other weaponry, while graphite is the largest component by volume of electric vehicle batteries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAccording to news agency Reuters, the move has sparked fresh concern that Beijing could next target other critical minerals, including those with even broader usage such as nickel or cobalt.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\u201cWe have a background process where AI is essentially simulating lots of random conversations between people, analyzing the outcome to see which conversations are most interesting \u2026 and then using that to propose \u2026 here you go, talk to this person, and by the way, you may want to hit these topics.\u201d\nAI will also become increasingly multimodal over the next year, helping it to do things like interact with text, as well as visual and audio inputs. Microsoft says you\u2019ll begin to see this when it launches its Copilot Vision for Copilot in Windows. The feature, which will be opt-in, will be able to see what you\u2019re looking at on a web page and then allow you to ask questions about it.\nSo, if you\u2019re looking at a movie, you might be able to ask Copilot Vision who\u2019s in it using your voice or text without naming the movie, and the app will know you\u2019re talking about the movie poster or web page you\u2019re looking at and provide the appropriate response.\nStory Continues\nIn addition to enhanced functionality, Microsoft says AI will become more energy efficient via hardware upgrades. The company claims that in the coming years new data centers will \u201cconsume zero water for cooling\u201d and that it will focus on using low-carbon steel and concrete alternatives.\nOn Monday, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft\u2019s largest cloud rival, also announced a push to make its data centers more efficient so that customers can get more computing power from the energy the servers currently use.\nMicrosoft, which has invested heavily in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, is among the slew of companies banking on AI as its next major growth opportunity. Amazon has invested in AI firm Anthropic, while Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which also invested in Anthropic, continues building out its Gemini AI family of products. Facebook parent Meta (META) is also leaning heavily into AI to power its ad sales and customer retention functionalities.\nWall Street, meanwhile, is looking for proof that Silicon Valley\u2019s massive AI investments are paying off via increased revenues and rising share prices.\nMicrosoft got out to an early lead in the generative AI space thanks to its OpenAI investments. Despite that, shares of Microsoft are up just 14% year to date compared to Google\u2019s stock, which is up 22%, and Amazon\u2019s, which is up 39%. The broader S&P 500 is up 26%.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

          "whole_article": "President-elect Donald Trump is making it clear he doesn't intend to ease up on the nation's technology giants once he is back in the Oval Office.\nThe latest sign came Wednesday when he said he would nominate Gail Slater, an aide to Vice President-elect JD Vance, to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division.\n\"Big Tech has run wild for years,\" Trump said in a statement announcing the appointment on his Truth Social platform, \"stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!\"\n\"I was proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail\u2019s leadership,\" he added.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump attends a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket, in Brownsville, Texas, on Nov. 19 . Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nThe appointment and comments from the president-elect offer a new signal that his administration could press forward with a series of investigations and lawsuits challenging the way the biggest companies in the technology industry, including Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), maintain their dominance.\nIt was Trump\u2019s first administration that initially sued Google over antitrust concerns, which led to a ruling by a district court judge in August that the tech giant illegally monopolized the search engine market. The DOJ has asked a judge to consider breaking up the company in a separate phase of the trial that won't wrap up until 2025.\nIt was also during Trump\u2019s first administration that the Federal Trade Commission sought to unwind Meta\u2019s (META) acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in a case set for trial in April. Trump's first administration also launched an antitrust investigation into Apple (APPL), leading the Biden administration to sue the iPhone maker earlier this year.\nAnother ominous sign for Big Tech is that last month Trump nominated Brendan Carr as Federal Communications Commission chair.\nJust days before he got that chairmanship appointment, Carr sent letters to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook predicting \"broad ranging actions to restore Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights\" once Trump takes office.\nBrendan Carr, Trump's pick to be FCC boss. Photo: Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\nThat might include \"a review of your companies\u2019 activities as well as third-party organizations and groups that have acted to curtail those rights,\" according to a copy of the letter Carr posted to X.\nThe appointment of Slater to run the DOJ's antitrust division elevates a figure who was a tech policy adviser at the National Economic Council during Trump\u2019s first term. She previously spent a decade at the Federal Trade Commission, including as an adviser to former Democratic FTC commissioner Julie Brill during President Barack Obama's administration.\nStory Continues\nThe FTC shares responsibility with the DOJ for enforcing the nation's antitrust laws.\nIn the private sector, Slater held positions at Fox Corp. and Roku. She also worked for the since-dismantled lobbying organization Internet Association, which advocated for the country's most powerful tech firms.\nThe companies included Amazon (AMZN), Airbnb (ABNB), Facebook (META), Google, eBay (EBAY), Microsoft (MSFT), Spotify (SPOT), Uber (UBER), X, and Zillow (Z).\nSlater's boss, Vance, has expressed admiration for the approach of FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has gained a reputation for aggressively pursuing lawsuits and investigations targeting the biggest tech giants.\nLina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that Khan had launched a wide-ranging antitrust investigation into Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.\nIt is still not known whether Trump will seek to replace Khan and with whom. Slater has acted as an adviser to the administration on that subject.\nThere is also no guarantee Khan\u2019s replacement will hold a similar point of view, or continue her pursuits.\n\u201cWe don't know who's going to succeed Lina Khan, but you can bet it's not going to be anyone with the philosophy of Lina Khan,\" said former FTC member and University of Baltimore Law School antitrust professor Robert Lande.\nTrump has sent some mixed messages about how far he wants to go to hold tech firms accountable.\nWhile campaigning, he was asked whether he supported a breakup of Google as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market. Trump suggested that Google\u2019s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet Inc. REUTERS/Carlos Barria \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview. The former president described Google\u2019s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nOn Wednesday, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said of Trump that \"in my conversations with him, he\u2019s definitely very focused on American competitiveness, particularly in technology, including AI.\"\nWhen asked at a New York Times DealBook summit in New York if Trump's election changes the dynamic for Google's antitrust case, he said, \"This is a DOJ case, and the case is already in court,\" noting that it started under Trump's first term.\n\"So I don\u2019t have any particular insights into that.\" The company, he added, will \"defend ourselves there.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "By Paul Sandle\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's decision to allow two of its four mobile networks to merge is the first big sign that regulators have taken on board the government's wish for them to prioritise economic growth and infrastructure investment over lower consumer prices. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) antitrust regulator cleared the $19 billion Vodafone-Three UK deal on Thursday after it accepted the companies' argument that better networks would drive competition and be good for the economy. The approval comes 18 months after the CMA infuriated Microsoft by blocking its $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal outright over concerns about competition in the nascent cloud gaming market.\nOn that occasion, it rejected Microsoft's offer of behavioural remedies - pledges on how the combined entity would operate to maintain competition - by saying they would be difficult to monitor.\nAfter Microsoft protested that Britain was closed for business, the increasingly isolated CMA changed tack to approve a revised deal.\nOn Thursday, it accepted behavioural remedies for the Vodafone-Three deal, tasking telecoms regulator Ofcom to oversee promises on pricing and investment to satisfy its competition concerns - a change in approach for the regulator.\nBritain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer told a forum of international investors in October that the CMA - which has played a bigger role in merger control since Britain left the European Union - and other regulators had to take \"growth as seriously as this room does\".\nThat message chimed with Vodafone's Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle, who put growth at the centre of her pitch when the deal was announced in June 2023.\nShe pressed the point on Thursday. \"Good connectivity is critical to so many parts of our lives and is central to the UK's economic growth ambitions,\" she said.\nBritain has some of the slowest mobile speeds in Europe, ranking 22nd out of 25 European countries for 5G availability and download speeds, according to analytics group OpenSignal.\nPRAGMATIC OUTCOME\nCompetition lawyer Alex Haffner, a partner at Fladgate, said the CMA's decision was notable for permitting a four-to-three network merger in mobile on the basis of purely behavioural remedies, reflecting a \"degree of pragmatism\".\n\"Over the past decade a multitude of four-to three mobile network mergers across Europe have been permitted only on the basis of significant structural remedies being conceded by the merging parties,\" he said.\nStory continues\nOperators have long argued that those structural remedies, which often entailed the creation of new challengers, kept pricing low but constrained investment and limited the benefits of the consolidation.\nCMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell said last month the regulator must \"evolve\" while staying true to its mandate to promote competition for the benefit of consumers. That would include rethinking its approach to agreeing remedies.\nCompetition lawyer Tom Smith said the CMA's dislike of behavioural remedies seemed to become a \"rigid policy position\" during the Microsoft-Activision merger.\nThursday's outcome suggested that it had eased that opposition, he said, even though such remedies would still only rarely be acceptable.\n\"In allowing the behavioural remedies in this case, the CMA and Ofcom have consigned themselves to at least eight years of monitoring the companies' activities and debating frequent revisions to the investment plan,\" he said.\n\"It will probably be less controversial than the Activision case, but it shouldn't be.\"\nOne senior M&A adviser said there was increasingly a view that the CMA under Cardell was more open to deals that led to more growth.\nAs a result it was favouring more behavioural remedies instead of structural ones, which could lead to more consolidation in other sectors, he said.\nThe CMA blocked a merger between Sainsbury's and Asda in 2019, a deal that would have united two of Britain's four largest supermarkets.\n(Reporting by Paul Sandle.

          "whole_article": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Microsoft Stock\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares closed higher on Wednesday.\nMicrosoft announced Tuesday that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 83 cents per share, which is payable March 13, 2025, to shareholders of record on Feb. 20, 2025.\nWith the recent buzz around Microsoft, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends, too. As of now, Microsoft offers an annual dividend yield of 0.76%. That\u2019s a quarterly dividend amount of 83 cents per share ($3.32 a year).\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $790,418 or around 1,807 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $157,909 or around 361 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($3.32 in this case). So, $6,000 / $3.32 = 1,807 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $3.32 = 361 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nMSFT Price Action: Shares of Microsoft gained 1.4% to close at $437.42 on Wednesday.\n\n\nRead More:\nTop 3 Tech And Telecom Stocks That May Implode This Quarter\nImage: Shutterstock\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

As a result, it estimated seeing a one-off impact for revising cost assumptions, expecting profits before tax to be \u00a380m than previously forecast, at \u00a3350m ($442m).\nRead more: Investors shift to US funds and tech in November amid lower interest rates\nIn another trading update in early November, Vistry then lowered its pre-tax profit guidance from \u00a3350m to \u00a3300m, as more details came to light around its cost issues in the division.\nThe stock is now down 27% year-to-date, giving it a market capitalisation of \u00a32.18bn, according to London Stock Exchange Group data.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said Vistry \"had been chasing faster-than-average growth since its transition to a partnership giant, specialising in providing affordable housing by teaming up with local authorities.\n\"But the scale of recent profit downgrades raised big questions about the new structure and internal controls, and seriously dented the share price.\"\nStory continues\n\u2022 USD\n(VTY.L)\nFollow\nView quote details\nFrasers Group (FRAS.L)\nMike Ashley's retail company Frasers Group is another stock will leave the FTSE 100, according to LSEG.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nThe projected fair value for Microsoft is US$504 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$437 suggests Microsoft is potentially trading close to its fair value\nAnalyst price target for MSFT is US$505 which is similar to our fair value estimate\nDoes the December share price for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\nSee our latest analysis for Microsoft\nIs Microsoft Fairly Valued?\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$67.8b\nUS$84.1b\nUS$108.3b\nUS$127.7b\nUS$154.2b\nUS$174.0b\nUS$191.1b\nUS$205.7b\nUS$218.4b\nUS$229.5b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x21\nAnalyst x22\nAnalyst x8\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 12.89%\nEst @ 9.81%\nEst @ 7.65%\nEst @ 6.14%\nEst @ 5.09%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0%\nUS$63.3k\nUS$73.4k\nUS$88.4k\nUS$97.4k\nUS$109.9k\nUS$115.9k\nUS$118.9k\nUS$119.6k\nUS$118.7k\nUS$116.5k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.0t\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$229b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.4t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.4t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$2.7t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.7t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$437, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nNasdaqGS:MSFT Discounted Cash Flow December 5th 2024\nImportant Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.066. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for Microsoft\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nMoving On:\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Microsoft, we've put together three relevant factors you should further research:\nRisks: Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Microsoft you should know about.\nFuture Earnings: How does MSFT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently.\nU.S. e-commerce sales hit a record this year on the unofficial shopping holiday, and artificial intelligence has played a starring role. According to Adobe Analytics, online spending has hit $10.8 billion in the US, and Generative AI chatbots drove a 1,800% surge in retail site traffic compared to 2023. These tools helped bargain hunters find deals, compare products, and check out more quickly.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nSimilarly, Salesforce revealed that the use of AI-enabled online chat services grew 31% year-on-year on Black Friday, with U.S. Black Friday online sales reaching $17.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Digital retailers using generative AI and agents in their customer service experiences saw a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those who did not.\nIn other news, OpenAI\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, told the Financial Times that the company is considering introducing ads on its platform. She further revealed that the company had recently hired Kevin Weil, an executive from Instagram, who was well-suited to the task.\n\u201cThe good news with Kevin Weil at the wheel with product is that he came from Instagram. He knows how this [introducing ads] works\u201d.\nHowever, a later statement issued by Friar reveals that while OpenAI may be open to the possibility, they currently don\u2019t have any active plans for the same.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re open to exploring other revenue streams in the future, we have no active plans to pursue advertising.\u201d\nA Bloomberg Opinion\u00a0column by Dave Lee\u00a0reveals that such an apparent change in statements could be because the AI Company realized that advertisements tend to signal \u201ctroubling trends\u201d. The shift may send doubts about the profitability of its subscription-based model, raising concerns about potential \u201censhittification\u201d, as tech commentator and activist Cory Doctorow famously terms it, where user-focused features are compromised for advertiser-driven engagement and time optimization.\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s endeavors are so huge that its revenues don\u2019t manage to cover them. The development of advanced AI models would require even greater spending, which is why advertising could be seen as an avenue to help bridge the gap. However, its risks undermine ChatGPT's appeal as an alternative to Google search, potentially disrupting its user experience, Lee\u00a0noted.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

And if you believe that the stock is really worth $385.27, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nWhat kind of growth will CrowdStrike Holdings generate?\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Earnings and Revenue Growth December 4th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. CrowdStrike Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in CRWD\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on CRWD, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing CrowdStrike Holdings at this point in time.

The latest country to embrace it is Japan. According to\u00a0The Japan Times,\u00a0private-sector businesses in the country have begun embracing related information technologies to enhance operational efficiency. GenAI search services, in particular, are proving\u00a0useful for searching corporate databases.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI News Updates This Weekend\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nThe news states how Lion, a leading Japanese consumer goods company, has built a generative AI-powered search system that allows its researchers to search through research reports and conference materials stored in the company\u2019s database efficiently.\n\u201cTo drive innovation, we need a system that allows researchers to have quick access to technical knowledge when they need it\u201d.\nYamaoka revealed that the time required to locate a desired document has been reduced to an average of one-fifth of that with conventional search systems. The company further states that GenAI is proving beneficial not only for recruits and young employees but also for those transitioning to new workplaces, allowing them to \u201csystematically acquire knowledge in unfamiliar fields\u201d. Even though GenAI comes with its fair share of challenges such as hallucinations and copyright concerns, it also stands to benefit the corporate world in the long run.\nIn other news, one popular AI chatbot is seemingly facing a technical glitch and preventing it from saying one name in particular: David Mayer. If there is one name in the AI realm that everyone knows about, it\u2019s ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence chatbot has been trained on large amounts of data to create content, including voices, music, pictures, and videos. However, it was recently unearthed by a Reddit user that the AI chatbot is unable to say David Mayer.\nAccording to AI expert Justine Moore, a plausible scenario is that someone named David Mayer went out of his way to remove his presence from the internet. For example, strict privacy laws in the European Union allow citizens to file \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +16%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 8.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -78.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +20.7%. This estimate has changed +10.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.36 indicates a change of +16.8% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +22.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.93 billion and $4.73 billion estimates indicate +28.5% and +20.4% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $1.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $982.26 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.84%. The EPS surprise was +14.81%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Have you evaluated the performance of CrowdStrike Holdings' (CRWD) international operations during the quarter that concluded in October 2024? Considering the extensive worldwide presence of this cloud-based security company, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial resilience and potential for growth.\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\nUpon examining CRWD's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\nFor the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $1.01 billion, experiencing an increase of 28.5% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of CRWD's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations.\nA Closer Look at CRWD's Revenue Streams Abroad\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa accounted for 15.90% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $160.57 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +2.08%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $157.3 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe, Middle East, and Africa contributed $148.85 million (15.44%) and $119.16 million (15.16%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Other International contributed $63.29 million in revenue, making up 6.27% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $62.13 million, this meant a surprise of +1.87%. Looking back, Other International contributed $61.75 million, or 6.41%, in the previous quarter, and $47.52 million, or 6.05%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nOf the total revenue, $102.84 million came from Asia Pacific during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 10.18%. This represented a surprise of -1.89% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $104.82 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $98.27 million, or 10.20%, and $81.46 million, or 10.36%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nStory Continues\nAnticipated Revenues in Overseas Markets\nIt is projected by analysts on Wall Street that CrowdStrike will post revenues of $1.03 billion for the ongoing fiscal quarter, an increase of 22.3% from the year-ago quarter. The expected contributions from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Other International and Asia Pacific to this revenue are 16.2%, 6.4% and 10.7%, translating into $167.41 million, $65.97 million and $110.85 million, respectively.\nFor the full year, the company is projected to achieve a total revenue of $3.93 billion, which signifies a rise of 28.5% from the last year. The share of this revenue from various regions is expected to be: Europe, Middle East, and Africa at 15.6% ($613.74 million), Other International at 6.2% ($242.11 million) and Asia Pacific at 10.4% ($407.54 million).\nKey Takeaways\nThe dependency of CrowdStrike on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\nIn an era of growing international ties and escalating geopolitical disputes, financial analysts on Wall Street pay keen attention to these developments to fine-tune their earnings estimations for businesses operating across borders. It's important to note, however, that a range of additional variables, like a company's local market status, also play a crucial role in shaping these forecasts.\nAt Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating mechanism, demonstrates a notable performance history confirmed through external audits. It effectively utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions to act as a predictor of a stock's price performance in the near term.\nCurrently, CrowdStrike holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signifying its potential to match the overall market's performance in the forthcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nExploring Recent Trends in CrowdStrike's Stock Price\nThe stock has witnessed an increase of 14.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's an increase of 3.5%. In the same interval, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has registered an increase of 0.1%. Over the past three months, the company's shares saw an increase of 40.4%, while the S&P 500 increased by 8.2%. In comparison, the sector experienced an increase of 6.5% during this timeframe.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading cybersecurity software company. Following a long period of outsized gains, shares fell 29.5% in the quarter after a software glitch caused a global Microsoft outage in July. Despite the outage, the company delivered solid second quarter results that exceeded the high end of expectations across all key metrics. Management called out several delayed deals but noted that they remained in the pipeline and should close in coming quarters. Increased scrutiny and the implementation of new incentives, including discounts and free products and flexibility on billings, will likely negatively impact bookings and revenue growth over the near term. While the range of outcomes on the implications of the outage on customer retention and willingness to expand with CrowdStrike remains wider than usual, leading us to reduce our position, we believe that the fact that the incident was not due to a breach, the company\u2019s competitively advantaged product, its transparent and rapid response, and the new procedures it had put in place, should help it retain its customers and grow wallet share over time.\"\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

A tighter labor market, record wealth, and \u201cpotentially lower energy prices\u201d are also reasons to celebrate. Investors have been happy about Donald Trump\u2019s win as well, noted Lakos-Bujas, fueling their expectations of lower taxes and deregulation across industries.\n\u201cHeightened geopolitical uncertainty and the evolving policy agenda are introducing unusual complexity to the outlook, but opportunities are likely to outweigh risks. The benefit of deregulation and a more business-friendly environment are likely underestimated along with potential for unlocking productivity gains and capital deployment\u201d.\nIn other news, artificial intelligence is stepping in to keep the Thanksgiving cheer alive, making sure holiday staples stay abundant and affordable for years to come.\n\u201cCranberry production is challenging \u2026 [and] growers are really concerned about heat stress events\u201d.\nArtificial intelligence is helping by speeding up the process of identifying heat-resistant varieties for cranberries.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss.\nDuring an appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box Europe, Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, discussed the outlook for the artificial intelligence industry and regulation in the United States with Donald Trump set to become president.\nWhen asked if there is a bit of a gold rush regarding AI, Calkins agreed. He said that AI comes with significant concerns, particularly among CEOs. This is because AI has the potential to embarrass organizations or compromise sensitive data, which creates hesitation. \u201cWe are all looking for a safe way to take the first step with AI,\u201d he said.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nRegarding whether companies are panicking about using AI profitably, Calkins observed a cautious approach from most businesses, while large tech firms have been investing aggressively. \u201cIt\u2019s a calculated risk, and they should be doing it,\u201d he said, contrasting this with the restraint shown by smaller companies.\nTalking about regulation, Calkins revealed that the bottom line is that AI can be somewhat dangerous if misused, which underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks. He referenced the European AI Act as an example, explaining that regulation could focus on restricting how AI is used or limiting the types of data it can access.\nWith the Trump administration coming in, Calkins predicted a strong focus on competing with China in the tech space. He also mentioned Elon Musk\u2019s influence on Trump, stating that Musk\u2019s influence on the Trump administration is positive because he knows deeply about artificial intelligence.\nIn other recent news, Sam Altman has announced a special event titled \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d. Altman will be revealing a new model or feature every weekday for two weeks, posted Altman on X, formerly Twitter. Some new models and features that users have been predicting include AI video generator Sora, the complete version of the \"o1\" reasoning model, and better control over ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice feature.\n\u201cEach weekday, we will have a livestream with a launch or demo, some big ones and some stocking stuffers\u201d.\nWith OpenAI seemingly in holiday spirits, the series of reveals will be live-streamed starting December 5, continuing for the next twelve weekdays. It looks like a very merry Christmas for all the tech fans.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets. On December 4th, HSBC analysts initiated coverage of chipmaker Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a \u201cHold\u201d rating and a price target of $160 per share. The rating initiation comes from Broadcom\u2019s increasing revenue exposure from artificial intelligence. As of Q3 2024, the company saw its revenues rise 47% to $13.1 billion, fueled by strong demand for AI semiconductor solutions and VMware.\nThe analysts told investors in a research note that Broadcom\u2019s valuation has risen significantly, now trading at 27 times its estimated earnings for fiscal 2025, compared to 18 times previously. However, the firm believes there is no room for further upside since the stock is already trading at a higher valuation than its competitors Nvidia and AMD. This is why the firm sees a less attractive risk/reward for Broadcom.\nOverall AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss.

Despite these hefty expenditures, Big Tech has been enjoying solid revenues and earnings growth. Yung-Yu Ma, CIO at BMO Wealth Management, recently joined\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to shed light on the overall AI sector outlook heading into 2024.\nMa believes that companies are increasing their investments in AI in anticipation of higher returns. He said that it makes sense that the market is less likely to be enthusiastic about this situation. Ma argued that while spending on AI is likely to increase, there is a certainty that the results will soon show, maybe by the end of 2025.\nHe added that the market will probably see healthy earnings growth in 2025. Spending is broadly going to drive these earnings, particularly AI and its different use cases such as data centers, electricity grids, and other infrastructure. He expects an overall growth in valuation and shared that Big Tech is extremely confident and committed to pouring investment into the sector.\nA Glance at Some Revolutionary AI Startups\n2024 has been quite a year for artificial intelligence. Existing startups like Anthropic and Databricks have been performing exceptionally well and transforming the industry.\nAnthropic is an AI safety and research company behind the OpenAI rival, Claude. On November 24, Anthropic extended its partnership with AWS, involving another $4 billion investment, bringing the total to $8 billion. The partnership also positions AWS as Anthropic\u2019s primary cloud and training partner. Keeping up with the partnership, on December 4, Anthropic began optimizing Claude models to be able to run on AWS Trainium 2.\nDatabricks, the data and AI company, is another AI startup crucial to the AI revolution. Some of the products by Databricks include data management solutions, data warehousing, real-time analytics, data sharing, and data governance. The company is expanding to new heights. On November 6, the company partnered with KT Corporation to boost data and AI innovation in Korea. Following the trend, on November 20, Databricks announced it saw 70% annualized growth in its French business and has launched a new office in central Paris.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with AI stocks that will skyrocket, we consulted media reports to shortlist stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well according to analysts and strategists.

The total market for custom chips could grow to about $45 billion by 2028 and be split between the two companies, Marvell COO Chris Koopmans said on Tuesday.\nThe market for custom chips will expand further, Summit Insights senior analyst Kinngai Chan said, adding that Marvell and Broadcom would benefit from this trend.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru and Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Pooja Desai)"

(NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced the availability of its 3.5D eXtreme Dimension System in Package (XDSiP\u2122) platform technology, enabling consumer AI customers to develop next-generation custom accelerators (XPUs). The 3.5D XDSiP integrates more than 6000 mm2 of silicon and up to 12 high bandwidth memory (HBM) stacks in one packaged device to enable high-efficiency, low-power computing for AI at scale. Broadcom has achieved a significant milestone by developing and launching the industry's first Face-to-Face (F2F) 3.5D XPU.\nThe immense computational power required for training generative AI models relies on massive clusters of 100,000 growing to 1 million XPUs. These XPUs demand increasingly sophisticated integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance while minimizing power consumption and cost. Traditional methods like Moore's Law and process scaling are struggling to keep up with these demands. Therefore, advanced system-in-package (SiP) integration is becoming crucial for next-generation XPUs. Over the past decade, 2.5D integration, which involves integrating multiple chiplets up to 2500 mm\u00b2 of silicon and HBM modules up to 8 HBMs on an interposer, has proven valuable for XPU development. However, as new and increasingly complex LLMs are introduced, their training necessitates 3D silicon stacking for better size, power, and cost. Consequently, 3.5D integration, which combines 3D silicon stacking with 2.5D packaging, is poised to become the technology of choice for next-generation XPUs in the coming decade.\nBroadcom\u2019s 3.5D XDSiP platform achieves significant improvements in interconnect density and power efficiency compared to the Face-to-Back (F2B) approach.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Will Benefit From AI. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks that will benefit from AI.\nArtificial intelligence has been the driving theme of the stock market over the past couple of years which have seen investors battle inflation and high interest rates. Ever since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT in November 2022 and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted the next year that there was a trillion-dollar market in play when it came to upgrading traditional computing hardware to accelerated computing, the stock market has seen no respite.\nHowever, when it comes to AI stocks, not all of them have flourished. Apart from Huang's firm, the world's leading graphics processing unit (GPU) designer, shares of OpenAI's biggest backer, i.e., the firm known for the Windows operating system, were two of the biggest initial AI beneficiaries. Between December 2022 and H1 2024, their shares have gained 631% and 75%, respectively. Other technology stocks have also ridden the AI wave and have posted gains ranging between 42% to 308%. Within these, the stock that has gained 308% is Facebook's parent entity and its focus on GPU investments and success with the Llama open source model have caught investor attention.\nThese firms have primarily posted gains because the AI wave, as analysts would like to remind you, is in its early stages. This stage is characterized by investor interest in firms that are AI enablers. However, the next stage of AI investment could see investors broaden their horizons. Some of this diversification away from technology stocks has already taken place in the form of impressive performance by utility stocks in 2024. Their performance is evident through the utility component of the flagship S&P index gaining 28% from the start of the year to the end of November as it led the benchmark index by a percentage point.\nWe analyzed this stage in AI investment in great detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. Stocks in this list range from utility firms to computer hardware providers, semiconductor firms, and glass companies. Within this list, data center hardware firms were quite common, and as you read below, you'll find out why they might be the biggest beneficiaries of the next wave in AI investment.\nWells Fargo has extensively covered the topic of what other stocks apart from the most valuable in the world can benefit from artificial intelligence. Its research covers firms that benefit from AI spending and applications. Starting from stocks that might benefit from AI spending, the bank notes that these will primarily include areas where the money trickles from AI data spending. In 2025, it estimates that hyperscaler cloud providers' capital expenditures can sit around a cool $180 billion. This is more than twice the expected spending by oil majors, which is estimated to sit at close to $85 billion.\nStory Continues\nSo where will this money trickle down to? Well, WF believes that while the \"largest portion of cost involved in constructing data centers is graphics processing units (GPUs) and the supercomputers that contain them,\" other sectors that should not be ignored include \"cabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators\" along with others that \"are required to lay the foundation and power generation to support the facility.\" While it lists down the usual culprits of information technology, communications services, and software firms that are part of discretionary stocks as the beneficiaries of data center spending, WF also adds two other sectors. These are industrial and material stocks, as the bank believes that while a \"data center may not be a factory, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it might be a duck.\"\nIt quotes research to share that since as much as 45% of the cost of building a data center \"is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out,\" firms that \"supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors)\" can benefit from the $180 billion in estimated hyperscaler capital expenditure. WF adds that data center spending will also include electrical and HVAC systems, as it notes that this sector can benefit from the fact that \"there are a relatively limited number of scaled suppliers of large electrical equipment, commercial HVAC systems, and diesel generators.\"\nFor some materials and industrial stocks, you can check out 10 Best Materials Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of stocks that will benefit from AI, we ranked the stocks part of our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. This upgrades the list since it was published when the latest hedge fund data was unavailable and it narrows down the list of stocks to the top fund favorites.\nWhy are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 128\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the biggest players in the semiconductor design industry. It is also a diversified technology firm that benefits from having a sizable software business under its wing. On the semiconductor front, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)'s modems and other products are used across a multitude of personal computing devices. This division also lends the firm the potential to generate additional favorable catalysts from the AI industry through custom chip design. NVIDIA's chips are among the most expensive and contested products in the world which has led to tight supply. Consequently, should firms like OpenAI turn to Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to design custom processors, the firm could add more AI tailwinds. On the flip side, the loss of key orders, such as those from Apple could create trouble.\nColumbia Threadneedle Investments mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cSimilar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company\u2019s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.\u201d\nOverall, AVGO ranks 6th on our list of stocks that will benefit from AI. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- The abrupt departure of Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger offers a fresh opportunity for the troubled company to consider potential deal options, including scenarios that he rejected during his time running the chipmaker.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nKansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit\nNYC\u2019s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp\nAs Wars Rage, Cities Face a Dark New Era of Urban Destruction\nRiyadh Metro Partially Opens in Bid to Ease City\u2019s Traffic Jams\nThe board has discussed a range of possibilities in recent months, such as private equity transactions and even a split of Intel\u2019s factory and product-design businesses. But Gelsinger was opposed to breaking up the company, focusing instead on his plan to restore Intel\u2019s technological edge and become a made-to-order manufacturer for outside clients.\nGelsinger left this week following pressure from the board and is set to receive as much as $10 million in severance pay. With his departure, there\u2019s a chance to reset the conversation. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have been helping the company ponder its options, and may find a more receptive audience in new management.\nIt\u2019s also an opportunity for suitors to take another look at acquiring some or all of the business. Qualcomm Inc. expressed some interest in a transaction before, though nothing got very far, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\u201cThis leadership change increases the probability of divestitures,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kunjan Sobhani and Oscar Hernandez Tejada said in a note Monday. \u201cGelsinger was firmly against breaking up the company, but the prolonged and expensive turnaround has tested shareholder patience, potentially forcing Intel to reconsider.\u201d\nIntel\u2019s board evaluated a number of scenarios during a critical meeting in September, including the idea of a breakup. The discussions followed an abysmal earnings report the previous month, when Intel posted a surprise loss and a disappointing sales forecast.\nBut Intel pushed forward with less radical changes, including a pause in the construction of plants in Poland and Germany. The company also is slashing roughly 15,000 jobs and suspended its decades-old dividend \u2014 part of attempts to conserve cash and keep Gelsinger\u2019s turnaround plan on track.\nIf the new CEO goes ahead with a bigger shake-up, these are deal ideas that Intel could revisit:\n1. Splitting Factory and Product Divisions\nThis would involve fully separating Intel\u2019s factory business from the more profitable unit that develops products. Under Gelsinger, the company has been expanding its manufacturing operations to become a foundry \u2014 a maker of components for outside customers. The idea is to eventually compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a pioneer of the foundry approach.\nStory Continues\nBut Intel has only announced a few big clients for its foundry operations, and production of high-end chips isn\u2019t large enough to make the endeavor profitable. Perhaps worse, sales have been sliding \u2014 an ominous sign for a business pushing into a big new industry segment.\nThough Intel might be able to find a suitor for its product division, the foundry operation would be a harder sell. The largest US chip foundry is GlobalFoundries Inc., which has its own struggles. That company lacks cash or experience in running the type of manufacturing that Intel\u2019s factories were built for.\nIt\u2019s also unclear if a new Intel CEO \u2014 or the rest of the board \u2014 would be ready to dismantle a company that once ruled the chip industry. And the move could complicate Intel\u2019s ability to get $7.9 billion in federal grants under the US Chips and Science Act, a law aimed at revitalizing domestic chip production.\nA representative for Santa Clara, California-based Intel declined to comment. The Commerce Department, which is in charge of Chips Act incentives, said of Gelsinger\u2019s departure that \u201cevolutions and transitions in the industry are to be expected,\u201d and the agency will stay focused on advancing economic and national security while safeguarding taxpayer dollars. Chips Act awards are dependent on reaching certain milestones, and they follow months of due diligence.\n2. Lure a Suitor Like Qualcomm\nBloomberg has reported that Qualcomm considered an Intel acquisition, but its interest had cooled as of last week. The complexities associated with acquiring all of Intel made a deal less attractive, people familiar with the matter said at the time.\nBut Qualcomm could consider buying pieces of Intel, such as the product business. Like much of the chip industry, Qualcomm doesn\u2019t manufacture its own semiconductors. Instead, it designs chips and relies on partners like TSMC to handle production. That\u2019s why it\u2019s unlikely to want Intel\u2019s factory operations.\nBroadcom Inc. previously assessed whether to pursue an Intel deal, but it didn\u2019t move ahead with talks, Bloomberg reported in September. When Broadcom CEO Hock Tan was asked that month if he might seek a chip acquisition, he said his hands were full integrating the purchase of VMware.\nAny big chip merger also would face regulatory hurdles around the world \u2014 something both Qualcomm and Broadcom know well. Broadcom scuttled an attempt to buy Qualcomm after the deal was blocked by President Donald Trump in 2018.\n3. Selling Altera\nIntel\u2019s Altera unit, acquired in 2015 for about $17 billion, makes chips that can be reprogrammed for different uses after they\u2019re manufactured. Intel has held negotiations about selling a portion of the business to financial investors, a potential step toward an initial public offering for the unit.\nBuyout firms such as Francisco Partners, Bain Capital and Silver Lake Management have been studying offers to invest in Altera. Last month, though, Bloomberg reported that Lattice Semiconductor Corp. was considering making an offer for all of Altera. Lattice is working with advisers and is seeking a private equity backer as it explores a potential bid, people familiar with the process said.\nWhether or not such a deal moves forward, the idea of unloading the entirety of Altera could have fresh momentum under a new Intel CEO.\n4. An Apollo Investment\nApollo offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel earlier this year. The New York-based firm indicated that it would be willing to make an equity-like investment of as much as $5 billion, Bloomberg reported in September. But negotiations didn\u2019t lead to an announcement.\nApollo has an existing relationship with Intel. The firm agreed in June to buy a stake in a venture that controls an Intel chip plant in Ireland for $11 billion. That makes it more likely that the partners will engage in further talks.\n5. A Mobileye Transaction\nIntel acquired Mobileye, a maker of self-driving technology, in 2017. Though the business went public in 2022, Intel still owns most of the company. That situation has the potential to change under a new CEO.\nIn September, Intel said it isn\u2019t \u201ccurrently\u201d planning to divest its majority stake in Mobileye. But Bloomberg reported earlier in the month that the chipmaker was contemplating options for its 88% holding.\nIntel could offload some of the stake in the public market or via a sale to a third party, people familiar with the discussions said. In any case, it\u2019s unlikely to be a winning investment for Intel, which paid about $15 billion for Mobileye. The company currently has a market value of $14.1 billion.\n--With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins.\n(Updates with Commerce Department\u2019s comment in 13th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDubai\u2019s Alleged Crypto Scams Are Raking in Billions\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nThe Quest to Turn Human Waste Into Medicine\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

Analysts said this change reflects Credo's transition towards a more profitable earnings growth model, particularly as it enters a multi-year adoption cycle for its Active Electrical Cable (AEC) product, which is instrumental for power-efficient AI clusters.\nFor the near term, BofA anticipates a strong second half for fiscal year 2025, driven by robust AI growth at Amazon Web Services, a key customer and investor in Credo.\n\u201cOur prior cautious view was based on limited TAM assumptions for AEC, but CRDO\u2019s earnings call addressed those concerns nicely, with 3x 10% customers, and growing momentum in other adjacent areas,\u201d analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote.\nAccording to BofA\u2019s note, Credo is expected to maintain operational expenditure growth at less than half of its sales growth over the next few years, with gross margins remaining resilient. This suggests significant operational leverage and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 74% in earnings per share between calendar years 2024-2027, compared to a 45% CAGR in sales.\nFurthermore, the company now boasts seven customers that each contribute more than 5% to sales, up from two in the previous quarter.\nBofA also highlights Credo\u2019s broadening product exposure and growing exposure to coveted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s AI chip Trainium2.\nDespite the positive outlook, BofA notes potential risks associated with Credo's premium valuation, sensitivity to shifts in AI deployment sentiment, and intensifying competition in the AEC market from companies like Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nAlso, gross margins are expected to remain flat in fiscal year 2025, while competitive pressures persist in AECs and other AI-related products. Additionally, sales concentration remains high, with three large hyperscale AEC customers comprising 58% of total sales.\nStory Continues\nRelated Articles\nBofA double upgrades Credo stock after strong Q3 print\nStanChart targets $200 billion in new wealth assets over next five years\nBig hedge funds score November gains with Trump election\nView Comments"

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently.\nU.S. e-commerce sales hit a record this year on the unofficial shopping holiday, and artificial intelligence has played a starring role. According to Adobe Analytics, online spending has hit $10.8 billion in the US, and Generative AI chatbots drove a 1,800% surge in retail site traffic compared to 2023. These tools helped bargain hunters find deals, compare products, and check out more quickly.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nSimilarly, Salesforce revealed that the use of AI-enabled online chat services grew 31% year-on-year on Black Friday, with U.S. Black Friday online sales reaching $17.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Digital retailers using generative AI and agents in their customer service experiences saw a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those who did not.\nIn other news, OpenAI\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, told the Financial Times that the company is considering introducing ads on its platform. She further revealed that the company had recently hired Kevin Weil, an executive from Instagram, who was well-suited to the task.\n\u201cThe good news with Kevin Weil at the wheel with product is that he came from Instagram. He knows how this [introducing ads] works\u201d.\nHowever, a later statement issued by Friar reveals that while OpenAI may be open to the possibility, they currently don\u2019t have any active plans for the same.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re open to exploring other revenue streams in the future, we have no active plans to pursue advertising.\u201d\nA Bloomberg Opinion\u00a0column by Dave Lee\u00a0reveals that such an apparent change in statements could be because the AI Company realized that advertisements tend to signal \u201ctroubling trends\u201d. The shift may send doubts about the profitability of its subscription-based model, raising concerns about potential \u201censhittification\u201d, as tech commentator and activist Cory Doctorow famously terms it, where user-focused features are compromised for advertiser-driven engagement and time optimization.\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s endeavors are so huge that its revenues don\u2019t manage to cover them. The development of advanced AI models would require even greater spending, which is why advertising could be seen as an avenue to help bridge the gap. However, its risks undermine ChatGPT's appeal as an alternative to Google search, potentially disrupting its user experience, Lee\u00a0noted.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

On the other hand, EPS and some top-line growth indicators, including billings and remaining performance obligations (RPO), fell slightly below consensus estimates, as products like Tableau, MuleSoft, and Slack revealed some weaknesses. Despite the mixed top-line result, CRM recorded double-digit growth in the Sales and Service Cloud segments, which is encouraging.\nSince the onset of the AI boom, Wall Street has been craving hard data to justify the lofty projections surrounding the industry's potential.

Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 4 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 4 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins this quarter was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million. Also, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nStory Continues\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 63.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $1,123 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,102.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.56%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.42%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.83%.\nThe the stock of maker of software that automates companies' technology operations has risen by 11.62% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.44% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.11%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of ServiceNow in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $3.60, indicating a 15.76% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.96 billion, up 21.28% from the prior-year quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.87 per share and revenue of $10.97 billion. These totals would mark changes of +28.66% and +22.33%, respectively, from last year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for ServiceNow should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. At present, ServiceNow boasts a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nInvestors should also note ServiceNow's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 75.09. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 30.22 for its industry.\nWe can also see that NOW currently has a PEG ratio of 3.05. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Computers - IT Services industry stood at 2.82 at the close of the market yesterday.\nStory Continues\nThe Computers - IT Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 39, which puts it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NOW) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$4.16b\nUS$5.10b\nUS$5.77b\nUS$6.93b\nUS$7.78b\nUS$8.51b\nUS$9.14b\nUS$9.68b\nUS$10.2b\nUS$10.6b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x24\nAnalyst x16\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 12.25%\nEst @ 9.36%\nEst @ 7.34%\nEst @ 5.92%\nEst @ 4.93%\nEst @ 4.24%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%\nUS$3.9k\nUS$4.5k\nUS$4.7k\nUS$5.3k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\nStory Continues\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$11b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$253b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$253b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$130b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$182b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$1.0k, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNYSE:NOW Discounted Cash Flow November 29th 2024\nImportant Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ServiceNow as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.042. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for ServiceNow\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nMoving On:\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For ServiceNow, we've compiled three essential aspects you should consider:\nRisks: Case in point, we've spotted 2 warning signs for ServiceNow you should be aware of.\nManagement:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for NOW's future outlook?

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +9.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share, indicating a change of +15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)\nWhat a fantastic six months it\u2019s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is NOW a Good Business?\nFounded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.\n1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nServiceNow\u2019s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters,\u00a0its year-on-year growth averaged\u00a024.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nSell-side analysts expect ServiceNow\u2019s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nServiceNow\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate\nServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\nStory Continues\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on ServiceNow, and with the recent rally, the stock trades at 17.6x forward price-to-sales (or $1,055 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than ServiceNow\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we\u2019re here to help you pick them.\nGet started by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like United Rentals (+550% five-year return).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

One such country in the picture that\u2019s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Updates You Can\u2019t Miss This Weekend and Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight\nThe remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do \"everything they can to lock their digital doors\" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\"While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it\".\nMcFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.\nIn other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on.

The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.\nThe search, which started on November 1st\u00a0took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it \u201ccannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs\u2019 copied articles were used to build [OpenAI\u2019s] models\u201d.\nStory Continues\n\u201cNews plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week\u2019s worth of its experts\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today\u201d.\nOpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.\nOn November 25, Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and a $1,150.00 price target. Key factors noted during a recent investor meeting have led to this buy rating. A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities. Another factor adding to the positive outlook is the disciplined approach to Pro Plus (the company's new generative AI SKU) pricing. The pressure on the Subscription Gross Margin in the coming year has already been factored into the analysis.\nOverall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nStory Continues\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
